<p>[!INCLUDE <a href="../includes/enclaves-os-reqs.html">enclaves-os-reqs.md</a>]</p>
<p>A Virtualization-based security (VBS) Enclave is a software-based trusted execution environment inside the address space of a host application. VBS Enclaves leverage underlying <a href="/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs">VBS technology</a> to isolate the sensitive portion of an application in a secure partition of memory. VBS Enclaves enable isolation of sensitive workloads from both the host application and the rest of the system.</p>
<p>By planning ahead and isolating the sensitive part of your workload, you can isolate it in a VBS Enclave, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>

<h2>Device requirements</h2>
<p>The following are required to run VBS Enclaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>VBS/HVCI must be enabled. This should be enabled on Windows 11 or later by default. See <a href="/windows/security/hardware-security/enable-virtualization-based-protection-of-code-integrity">Enable virtualization-based protection of code integrity</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Windows 11 Build 26100.2314 or later <em><strong>or</strong></em> Windows Server 2025 or later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Development prerequisites</h2>
<p>In addition to the device requirements, the following are required to develop VBS Enclaves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 or later - The <a href="/cpp/build/reference/compiling-a-c-cpp-program">Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (MSVC)</a> is required. Installing Visual Studio simplifies this.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/">Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)</a> version 10.0.22621.3233 or later, which provides <code>veiid.exe</code> (the VBS Enclave import ID binding utility) and <code>signtool.exe</code>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/trusted-signing">Trusted Signing</a> account.</li>
</ul>

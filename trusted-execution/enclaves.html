<h1>Secure Enclaves (Trusted Execution)</h1>
<p>Enclaves are used to create trusted execution environments. An enclave is an isolated region of code and data within the address space for an application. Only code that runs within the enclave can access data within the same enclave.</p>
<p>The following enclave technologies (or enclave types) are currently supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtualization-based Security (VBS) enclaves</strong> - a software-based technology that relies on Windows hypervisor and doesn't require any special hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX) enclaves</strong> - a hardware-based trusted execution environment technology.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Using these APIs for a VBS Enclave requires Windows 11 Build 26100.2314 or later or Windows Server 2025 or later.</p>

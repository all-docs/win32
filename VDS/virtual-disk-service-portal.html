<h1>Virtual Disk Service</h1>
<p>[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the Virtual Disk Service COM interface is superseded by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal">Windows Storage Management API</a>.]</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Virtual Disk Service (VDS) manages a wide range of storage configurations, from single-disk desktops to external storage arrays. The service exposes an application programming interface (API).</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 8, the Virtual Disk Service COM interface is superseded by the Storage Management API, a WMI-based programming interface. For managing storage subsystems, (Windows) disks, partitions, and volumes, we strongly recommend using the Storage Management API. For more information, see the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal">Windows Storage Management API</a>.</p>
<p>For all usages except mirror boot volumes (using a mirror volume to host the operating system ), dynamic disks are deprecated. For data that requires resiliency against drive failure, use Storage Spaces, a resilient storage virtualization solution. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831739(v=ws.11)">Storage Spaces Technical Preview</a>.</p>
<p>Application developers who use the interfaces described in this guide can query and configure a heterogeneous set of vendor-supplied and internally managed storage. VDS hides from applications the complexities associated with storage, making the service both vendor and technology neutral.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>This documentation is intended for application developers who are familiar with the storage capabilities of Microsoft Windows platforms and who are knowledgeable about COM development.</p>
<p>The guide is also intended for hardware subsystem manufacturers who develop and support VDS hardware provider programs.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>VDS is supported on Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and later. For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the documentation for that element.</p>
<p>Running 32-bit VDS applications under WOW64 is supported, but 64-bit VDS providers must run as native applications on 64-bit Windows versions.</p>
<p>VDS is available in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). You can install the SDK for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=8279">Windows Download Center</a>. This version of the Windows SDK can be used to develop VDS applications for Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and later. You can also download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=8442">ISO version</a> of the SDK from the Windows Download Center.</p>

<h1>Configuration Stacking</h1>
<p>[Beginning with WindowsÂ 8 and Windows ServerÂ 2012, the <a href="virtual-disk-service-portal.html">Virtual Disk Service</a> COM interface is superseded by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal">Windows Storage Management API</a>.]</p>
<p>Stacking involves the concatenating of a set of logical block mappings. You can stack multiple LUNs from the same subsystem under one LUN. You can stack a LUN together with volumes from the same pack under one volume. Further, you can stack multiple LUNs that are surfaced by heterogeneous subsystems under one volume.</p>
<p>As the following illustration shows, the creating of a volume does not change the existing binding of a contributing LUN. Similarly, the unbinding of a volume does not unbind a contributing LUN. The illustration depicts the RAID 0 1 (0+1) configuration. This well-known configuration combines striping (RAID 0) and mirroring (RAID 1), which pairs the fast data access of RAID 0 with the reliability of RAID 1.</p>

<p>Contributing LUNs can have different binding types. Many configurations are possible with VDS but are highly unlikely, such as the next illustration. In this example, one volume plex is a striped LUN and the other is a three-way mirrored LUN.</p>
<p><img src="images/vdsstacklunvol.png" alt="Diagram that shows a VDS configuration where one volume plex is a striped LUN and the other is a 3-way mirrored LUN." /></p>
<p>Although impractical, this example illustrates an important aspect of stacking. Because stacking concatenates plexes, VDS adds the three LUN plexes to the two volume plexes for a total of five plexes.</p>

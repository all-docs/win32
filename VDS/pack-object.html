<h1>Pack Object</h1>
<p>[Beginning with WindowsÂ 8 and Windows ServerÂ 2012, the <a href="virtual-disk-service-portal.html">Virtual Disk Service</a> COM interface is superseded by the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal">Windows Storage Management API</a>.]</p>
<p>A pack object models a disk group, a collection of disks and volumes managed by the basic or dynamic software provider. A provider can contain multiple pack objects.</p>
<p>Using the API, applications can direct VDS to add one or more disks to a pack, bind the disks into volumes, and optionally move the disks as a unit between hosts. You cannot import an existing volume into a pack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Membership in a pack does not imply consistency among disks with respect to performance, media, interconnection protocol, or other characteristics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Disk objects are either unallocated, and managed by VDS, or are members of exactly one pack. The basic software provider can have zero or more packs, each containing a single basic disk. The provider imposes no limits to the number of volumes on a basic disk. The dynamic provider can have zero or more packs with multiple dynamic disks in each pack. This provider limits the number of volumes on a disk, based on the one-megabyte size of the logical disk manager (LDM) database. Given that a volume has at least one plex and one disk extent, the maximum number of volumes to a pack is approximately 1000. The maximum number goes down as the number of disks goes up.</p>
<p>In addition to disk objects, a pack can contain one or more LUN objects implemented by one or more hardware providers. To the Windows kernel, a LUN is just another disk. (LUN objects must be unmasked to the computer that is executing the provider program.) When the disk is a LUN, the LUN object exposes both the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vds/nn-vds-ivdslun"><strong>IVdsLun</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vds/nn-vds-ivdsdisk"><strong>IVdsDisk</strong></a> interfaces. A pack object uses <strong>IVdsDisk</strong>, instead of <strong>IVdsLun</strong>, to enumerate the LUNs in a pack. For a more detailed description of a LUN, see the <a href="lun-object.html">LUN Object</a>.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows a pack with two members: a disk and a LUN. An application can add these objects to an online pack and create a volume from the underlying disk and drive extents represented by spindles.</p>
<p><img src="images/vdsdisksareluns.png" alt="Diagram that shows a 'Pack' with a disk and a LUN being added by an application to create a volume represented by a 'Drive' and 'Spindle'." /></p>
<p>Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vds/nf-vds-ivdsswprovider-createpack"><strong>IVdsSwProvider::CreatePack</strong></a> method to create a new pack object. Callers can get a pointer to a specific pack by selecting the desired pack object from the enumeration that is returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vds/nf-vds-ivdsswprovider-querypacks"><strong>IVdsSwProvider:: QueryPacks</strong></a> method. With a pack object, you can add, remove, or replace the members of a pack. When you add a disk object to a pack, VDS initializes a disk to unbind all existing volumes. In contrast, a LUN retains all binding details when it is added to a pack. If you remove the last disk from a pack, VDS deletes the pack object when the caller releases the last reference to the object.</p>
<p>Object properties include an object identifier, a name, pack status, and flags. An online pack is available for configuration and use, an offline pack is unavailable. VDS supports any number of online and offline packs.</p>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2003:</strong> Supports only one online pack at a time.</p>
<p>VDS enforces a quorum of online disks within a pack. The quorum determines whether a pack can have an online status, and prevents multiple hosts from granting an online status to the same pack. If the number of online disks in a pack falls below the quorum (n/2 + 1), VDS takes the online pack offline.</p>

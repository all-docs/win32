<h1>Grouping Shapes</h1>
<p>This topic describes VML, a feature that is deprecated as of Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 9. Webpages and applications that rely on VML should be migrated to SVG or other widely supported standards.</p>

<p>As you've learned, you can easily draw individual shapes by using VML. In this section, we will explain the benefits of grouping shapes together, and how to group shapes.</p>
<p>If you had many shapes that needed to be scaled, moved, or rotated together, you would find it tedious to set the attributes individually for each shape. Plus you would raise your margin for errors. It would be better if you could group the shapes, and then set the attributes for the entire group.</p>
<p>In VML, you can use the <code>&lt;group&gt;</code> element to group many shapes together so that they can be transformed as one unit. For example, as shown in the following VML representation, you can easily group two shapes together.</p>
<pre lang="HTML"><code>&lt;v:group id=&quot;GroupA&quot; style='position:relative;left:10pt;top:20pt;
width:150pt;height:100pt; ...&gt;
   &lt;v:shape id=&quot;Shape1&quot;...&gt;&lt;/v:shape&gt;
   &lt;v:shape id=&quot;Shape2&quot;...&gt;&lt;/v:shape&gt;
&lt;/v:group&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When shapes are grouped, they use the <a href="web-workshop---how-to-use-vml-on-web-pages----local-coordinate-space.html">local coordinate space</a> of the group. Therefore, shapes within a group can be scaled and moved together. You will see more examples in the Use Local Coordinate Space topic.</p>
<p>Inside a group, you can have as many shapes or groups as you want. When a group is inside another group, it is called a &quot;nested group&quot;. There is no limitation on the levels of nesting.</p>
<p>For example, the following lines demonstrate a 3-level nested group. Shape3 and Shape4 are in GroupC. Shape2 and GroupC are in GroupB. Shape1 and GroupB are in GroupA.</p>
<pre lang="HTML"><code>&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;v:group id=&quot;GroupA&quot;...&gt;
      &lt;v:shape id=&quot;Shape1&quot;...&gt;&lt;/v:shape&gt;
      &lt;v:group id=&quot;GroupB&quot;...&gt;
         &lt;v:shape id=&quot;Shape2&quot;...&gt;&lt;/v:shape&gt;
         &lt;v:group id=&quot;GroupC&quot;...&gt;
            &lt;v:shape id=&quot;Shape3&quot;...&gt;&lt;/v:shape&gt;
            &lt;v:shape id=&quot;Shape4&quot;...&gt;&lt;/v:shape&gt;
         &lt;/v:group&gt;
      &lt;/v:group&gt;
   &lt;/v:group&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

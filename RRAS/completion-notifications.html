<h1>Completion Notifications</h1>
<p>The Remote Access Connection Manager continues progress notifications until the connection operation has been completed. This occurs in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The handler receives a RASCS_Connected, or RASCS_Disconnected notification. The RAS client application can exit without breaking any established connection.</li>
<li>An error occurs. The handler receives a notification indicating the error and the connection state when the error occurred. The RAS client application can exit.</li>
</ul>
<p>The RAS client application should not assume the connection operation is complete after calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ras/nf-ras-rashangupa"><strong>RasHangUp</strong></a>. It should wait for one of the preceding conditions before exiting.</p>

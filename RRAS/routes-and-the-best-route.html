<h1>Routes and the Best Route</h1>
<p>A route is a &quot;network path&quot; to a destination that has a certain cost associated with it. The cost is represented by its administrative preference and its protocol-specific metric. Routes with lower costs are preferred over all other routes.</p>
<p>A route entry in the routing table includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A handle to the destination</li>
<li>The owner of this route</li>
<li>The neighbor (peer) that provided the route information</li>
<li>Flags associated with the state of the route</li>
<li>Flags associated with the route</li>
<li>The preference and metric for the route</li>
<li>The list of views to which the route belongs</li>
<li>Information that is private to the owner of the route</li>
<li>A list of next hops used to reach the destination</li>
</ul>
<p>The following values, taken together, uniquely identify a route in the routing table:</p>
<ul>
<li>The destination network</li>
<li>The owner of the route</li>
<li>The neighbor who supplied the route</li>
</ul>
<h2>Metrics and Preference</h2>
<p>Each route has an administrative preference (specified by the routing policy), and a client-dependent metric. The routing table manager uses this information to determine which route is the better route to a destination. Routes with lower preference are better routes (one being lowest, and therefore best). If two routes have the same preference, the route with the lower metric is the better route.</p>
<p>Normally, the preference of a route is determined by the preference of the client that added the route. However, for any routes added using the Netsh.exe management tool, a preference value can be specified on a per-route basis.</p>
<p>Preference is normally used to indicate priority between clients. For example, an administrator can assign OSPF a lower (better) preference than RIP. In this case, OSPF routes are preferable to RIP routes.</p>

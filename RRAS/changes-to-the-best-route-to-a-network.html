<h1>Changes to the Best Route to a Network</h1>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2003:</strong> This API has been superseded by the <a href="about-routing-table-manager-version-2.html">Routing Table Manager Version 2</a> API and will not be available beyond Windows Server 2003. New applications should use the Routing Table Manager Version 2 API.</p>
<p>A change in any of the following values for the best route to a given destination network causes the routing table manager to generate a notification message sent to each registered client and to the forwarders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protocol identifier</li>
<li>Interface index</li>
<li>Address of next-hop router</li>
<li>Protocol family-specific data that includes route metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>A change in protocol identifier, interface index, or next-hop router address occurs when a new, better-route entry is added, or when the current best-route entry is deleted or aged out, and leaves another route as the new best route.</p>

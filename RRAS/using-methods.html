<h1>Using Methods</h1>
<p>When a client registers with the routing table manager, it can export a set of methods. These methods are used by other clients to obtain client-specific information. Methods enable private communication between clients of the routing table manager.</p>
<p>A client can obtain the list of methods exported by another client. The client calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmgetentitymethods"><strong>RtmGetEntityMethods</strong></a> function, supplying the target client's handle.</p>
<p>Each method exported by a client is uniquely identified by its method identifier. Each client can export up to 32 methods. Each method corresponds to a bit set in the <strong>MethodType</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/rtmv2/nc-rtmv2-_entity_method"><strong>RTM_ENTITY_EXPORT_METHOD</strong></a> structure. To invoke multiple methods, the client should perform a logical OR of the identifiers for those methods. The syntax and semantics of input and output structures for each protocol must be specified when the protocol is implemented.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Method identifier values that correspond to a bit set in the lower half of the <strong>MethodType</strong> member (the lower 16 bits) are reserved by Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>To invoke a second client's method, a client calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtminvokemethod"><strong>RtmInvokeMethod</strong></a> function. The routing table manager arbitrates all requests to invoke a client's methods. The routing table manager performs two functions when it arbitrates between clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing the second client from invoking a method for a client that is unregistering.</li>
<li>Holding an &quot;invoke&quot; request when methods are blocked, and allowing the request to continue when the methods are unblocked.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a client must prevent other clients from executing its methods, the client can call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmblockmethods"><strong>RtmBlockMethods</strong></a>. The routing table manager will not allow a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtminvokemethod"><strong>RtmInvokeMethod</strong></a> to be processed until the client unblocks its methods again.</p>
<p>Clients typically block methods when making changes to the private data that is exchanged between clients. Blocking methods is an optional action. A client can also use internal locks to prevent other clients from invoking methods.</p>
<p>For sample code that shows how to use these functions, see <a href="obtain-and-call-the-exported-methods-for-a-client.html">Obtain and Call the Exported Methods for a Client</a>.</p>

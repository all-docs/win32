<h1>RAS AutoDial</h1>
<p>A feature called &quot;default connection&quot; was added to the system in Windows XP. If there is a failed connection attempt, the system checks for an explicit match (for Winsock name or share name) in the database if not, it dials the default connection if there is one.</p>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ 2000:</strong> When an attempt to connect to a network address fails because the host cannot be reached, the AutoDial feature can automatically start a dial-up connection operation. To do this, AutoDial searches its database of network addresses to find a phone-book entry that it can use to establish the connection.</p>
<p>**WindowsÂ NTÂ 4.0:Â Â ** RAS keeps a database of the Winsock names and/or share names that you have successfully reached while a RAS/VPN connection was active. Later, when a winsock or share connection attempt fails, the system checks this database and offers to dial the stored connection for you.</p>

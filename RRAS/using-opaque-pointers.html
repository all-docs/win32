<h1>Using Opaque Pointers</h1>
<p>Clients often must store additional, client-specific information about destinations. The routing table manager enables clients to store this information in destination structures in the routing table. The information is stored and retrieved by using <em>opaque pointers</em>. The information stored is private, and accessible only to the client that owns the opaque pointer.</p>
<p>For example, the multicast group manager keeps a list of multicast forwarding entries that are dependent on a particular destination. The multicast group manager uses an opaque pointer in that destination. In another example, a routing protocol that advertises a particular destination can keep information related to its own route advertisement of the destination using an opaque pointer, even though it does not own the best route.</p>
<p>The number of opaque pointers is limited; these pointers are allocated to clients on a first-come, first-served basis. The router administrator must allocate the correct number of pointers during the router configuration; therefore, routing protocols and other clients must document their use of opaque pointers.</p>

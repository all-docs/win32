<h1>Retrieving Changes</h1>
<p>Once a client has registered for notification of certain changes and one or more of these changes occurs, the client receives a notification from the routing table manager. The routing table manager uses the <a href="/windows/win32/api/rtmv2/nc-rtmv2-_event_callback"><strong>RTM_EVENT_CALLBACK</strong></a> callback that was supplied in a previous call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmregisterentity"><strong>RtmRegisterEntity</strong></a>. The routing table manager indicates that a RTM_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION event has occurred.</p>
<p>For sample code that shows how to use these functions, see <a href="use-the-event-notification-callback.html">Use the Event Notification Callback</a>.</p>

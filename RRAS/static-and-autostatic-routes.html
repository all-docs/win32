<h1>Static and Autostatic Routes</h1>
<p>Typically, routes to remote networks are obtained dynamically through routing protocols. However, the administrator can also <em>seed</em> the routing table by providing routes manually. These routes are referred to as <em>static</em>. A static route is associated with an interface that represents the remote network. Unlike dynamic routes, static routes are retained even if the router is restarted or the interface is disabled.</p>
<p>An <em>autostatic</em> route is obtained through a routing protocol, but once obtained behaves like a static route. The process for obtaining autostatic routes is as follows: The IP or IPX router manager issues a request that a routing protocol update the routing information for a specific interface. The results of the update are then converted into static routes. Note that only certain routing protocols support requests for autostatic route updates.</p>

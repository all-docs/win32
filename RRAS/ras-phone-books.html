<h1>RAS Phone Books</h1>
<p>Phone books provide a standard way to collect and specify the information that the Remote Access Connection Manager needs to establish a remote connection. Phone books associate entry names with information such as phone numbers, COM ports, and modem settings. Each phone-book entry contains the information needed to establish a RAS connection.</p>
<p>Phone books are stored in phone-book files, which are text files that contain the entry names and associated information. RAS creates a phone-book file called RASPHONE.PBK. The user can use the main <strong>Dial-Up Networking</strong> dialog box to create personal phone-book files. The RAS API does not currently provide support for creating a phone-book file. Some RAS functions, such as the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ras/nf-ras-rasdiala"><strong>RasDial</strong></a> function, have a parameter that specifies a phone-book file. If the caller does not specify a phone-book file, the function uses the default phone-book file, which is the one selected by the user in the <strong>User Preferences</strong> property sheet of the <strong>Dial-Up Networking</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p>WindowsÂ NTÂ 4.0 provides the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rasdlg/nf-rasdlg-rasphonebookdlga"><strong>RasPhonebookDlg</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rasdlg/nf-rasdlg-rasentrydlga"><strong>RasEntryDlg</strong></a> functions that display the built-in RAS user interface that enable users to work with phone books and phone-book entries.</p>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ 95:</strong> Dial-up networking stores phone-book entries in the registry rather than in a phone-book file. WindowsÂ 95 does not support personal phone-book files or functions that display the built-in RAS dialog boxes.</p>

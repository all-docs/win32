<h1>Connection States</h1>
<p>During the process of connecting to a remote server, the Remote Access Connection Manager and the RAS server on the remote computer perform several steps to establish the connection. Each of these steps is identified by a connection state. The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa376727(v=vs.85)"><strong>RASCONNSTATE</strong></a> enumeration is a set of values that correspond to these connection states. The connection states can be divided into the following three groups:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Running states</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The running states are the parts of the connection operation that RAS handles automatically, such as connecting to the necessary devices, authenticating the user, and waiting for a callback from the remote server. Unless an error occurs, the RAS client need take no action other than to pass the notification on to the user.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paused states</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <a href="paused-states.html">paused states</a> occur when the remote server pauses the connection operation to get additional input from the user. During a paused state, the user can type a <a href="callback-connections.html">callback</a> number, a different user name and password if the user authentication fails, or a new password if the old one has expired.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Terminal states</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The terminal states occur when the connection has been successfully established, the connection operation has failed, or the connection has been broken by a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ras/nf-ras-rashangupa"><strong>RasHangUp</strong></a> call.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are several mechanisms that a RAS client can use to determine the current state of a connection operation. When a RAS client executes the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ras/nf-ras-rasdiala"><strong>RasDial</strong></a> function asynchronously, the Remote Access Connection Manager sends progress notifications to the client's <a href="notification-handlers.html">notification handler</a> whenever the connection state changes. In addition, the client can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ras/nf-ras-rasgetconnectstatusa"><strong>RasGetConnectStatus</strong></a> function to get the current state of any RAS connection operation.</p>

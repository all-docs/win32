<h1>Next Hop</h1>
<p>A next hop is the next router on the path towards a destination. Packets from a source are forwarded to a destination on a hop-by-hop basis.</p>
<p>The address of the router that is the next hop in a route is used to uniquely identify links on a point-to-multipoint interface, where all the links share the same interface index.</p>

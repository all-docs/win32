description: After the multicast group manager is notified by IGMP that there are no more receivers present for a group on an interface, the multicast group manager invokes the PMGM_LOCAL_LEAVE_CALLBACK callback to the routing protocol on that interface if one exists. This callback notifies the routing protocol of the change.

<h1>Local Leave Callbacks</h1>
<p>After the multicast group manager is notified by IGMP that there are no more receivers present for a group on an interface, the multicast group manager invokes the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mgm/nc-mgm-pmgm_local_leave_callback"><strong>PMGM_LOCAL_LEAVE_CALLBACK</strong></a> callback to the routing protocol on that interface if one exists. This callback notifies the routing protocol of the change.</p>
<p>This callback and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mgm/nc-mgm-pmgm_local_join_callback"><strong>PMGM_LOCAL_JOIN_CALLBACK</strong></a> callback are used to synchronize forwarding between IGMP and routing protocols.</p>

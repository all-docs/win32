<h1>RPF Alert Callbacks</h1>
<p>After the multicast group manager receives notification of a packet from a new source or of a packet that is destined for a new group, the multicast group manager looks up the route to the source in the multicast view of the routing table. The multicast group manager then invokes the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mgm/nc-mgm-pmgm_rpf_callback"><strong>PMGM_RPF_CALLBACK</strong></a> callback to the protocol that owns the interface the data arrived on.</p>
<p>After this callback is invoked, the routing protocol can change the incoming interface if the routing protocol must receive the data for the group on a different interface.</p>

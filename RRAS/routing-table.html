<h1>Routing Table</h1>
<p>The routing table manager maintains a distinct routing table for each address family (such as IPX and IPv4). The IPX address family is supported by the RTMv1 API; IPv4 is supported by the RTMv2 API.</p>
<p>The routing table consists of destinations, routes, and next hops. These entries define a route to a destination network.</p>

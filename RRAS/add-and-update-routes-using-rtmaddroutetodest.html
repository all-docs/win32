<h1>Add and Update Routes Using RtmAddRouteToDest</h1>
<p>The function <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmaddroutetodest"><strong>RtmAddRouteToDest</strong></a> is used to add new routes and update existing routes for a destination. The following procedures explain both cases. The sample code that follows shows how to implement the first procedure.</p>
<p><strong>To add a route, the client should take the following steps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the client has already cached the next-hop handle, go to step 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_nexthop_info"><strong>RTM_NEXTHOP_INFO</strong></a> structure and fill it with the appropriate information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the next hop to the routing table by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmaddnexthop"><strong>RtmAddNextHop</strong></a>. The routing table manager returns a handle to the next hop. If the next hop already exists, the routing table does not add the next hop; instead it returns the handle to the next hop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info"><strong>RTM_ROUTE_INFO</strong></a> structure and fill it with the appropriate information, including the next-hop handle returned by the routing table manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the route to the routing table by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmaddroutetodest"><strong>RtmAddRouteToDest</strong></a>. The routing table manager compares the new route to the routes that are already in the routing table. Two routes are equal if all of the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The route is being added to the same destination.</li>
<li>The route is being added by the same client as specified by the <strong>Owner</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info"><strong>RTM_ROUTE_INFO</strong></a> structure.</li>
<li>The route is advertised by the same neighbor as specified by the <strong>Neighbor</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info"><strong>RTM_ROUTE_INFO</strong></a> structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the route exists, the routing table manager returns the handle to the existing route. Otherwise, the routing table manager adds the route and returns the handle to the new route.</p>
<p>The client can set the <em>Change_Flags</em> parameter to RTM_ROUTE_CHANGE_NEW to instruct the routing table manager to add a new route on the destination, even if another route with the same owner and neighbor fields exists.</p>
<p>The client can set the <em>Change_Flags</em> parameter to RTM_ROUTE_CHANGE_FIRST to tell the routing table manager to update the first route on the destination owned by the client. This update can be performed if such a route exists, even if the neighbor field does not match. This flag is used by clients that maintain a single route per destination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To update a route, the client should take the following steps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmgetrouteinfo"><strong>RtmGetRouteInfo</strong></a> with the handle to the route. The handle is either one previously cached by the client, or returned by the routing table manager from a call that returns a route handle such as <strong>RtmGetRouteInfo</strong>.</li>
<li>Make the changes to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info"><strong>RTM_ROUTE_INFO</strong></a> structure that is returned by the routing table manager.</li>
<li>Call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmaddroutetodest"><strong>RtmAddRouteToDest</strong></a> with the handle to the route and the changed <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_route_info"><strong>RTM_ROUTE_INFO</strong></a> structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following sample code shows how to add a route to a destination using the routing table manager as an intermediary.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>// Add a route to a destination given by (addr, masklen)
// using a next hop reachable with an interface

    RouteInfo.NextHopsList.NumNextHops = 1;
    RouteInfo.NextHopsList.NextHops[0] = NextHopHandle;

    // If you want to add a new route, regardless of
    // whether a similar route already exists, use the following 
    //     ChangeFlags = RTM_ROUTE_CHANGE_NEW;

    ChangeFlags = 0;

    Status = RtmAddRouteToDest(RtmRegHandle,
                               &amp;RouteHandle,     // Can be NULL if you do not need handle
                               &amp;NetAddress,
                               &amp;RouteInfo,
                               1000,             // Time out route after 1000 ms
                               RouteListHandle1, // Also add the route to this list
                               0,
                               NULL,
                               &amp;ChangeFlags);

    if (Status == NO_ERROR)
    {
        if (ChangeFlags &amp; RTM_ROUTE_CHANGE_NEW)
        {
        ; // A new route has been created

        else

        // Release the route handle if you do not need it
        RtmReleaseRoutes(RtmRegHandle, 1, &amp;RouteHandle);

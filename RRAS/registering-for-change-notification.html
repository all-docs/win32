<h1>Registering for Change Notification</h1>
<p>A client can register to receive notification of changes to routing information that is stored in the routing table manager. This request can only be made after a client has registered with the routing table manager.</p>
<p>To register for change notification, a client must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmregisterforchangenotification"><strong>RtmRegisterForChangeNotification</strong></a>, specifying the types of changes for which the client must receive notification. If the client must be notified of change to specific destinations, the client calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmmarkdestforchangenotification"><strong>RtmMarkDestForChangeNotification</strong></a> once for each destination.</p>
<p>The client can stop receiving change notifications by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmderegisterfromchangenotification"><strong>RtmDeregisterFromChangeNotification</strong></a>.</p>
<p>For sample code that shows how to use these functions, see <a href="register-for-change-notification.html">Register For Change Notification</a>.</p>

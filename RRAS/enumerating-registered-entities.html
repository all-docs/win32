<h1>Enumerating Registered Entities</h1>
<p>After a client has registered, the client can obtain a list of all the other clients that have registered with the routing table manager. Some clients must perform certain operations if the presence of a particular type of client is detected.</p>
<p>The client can call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmgetregisteredentities"><strong>RtmGetRegisteredEntities</strong></a> function. A buffer of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/ns-rtmv2-rtm_entity_info"><strong>RTM_ENTITY_INFO</strong></a> structures is returned. After the client has processed this information, the client should call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmreleaseentities"><strong>RtmReleaseEntities</strong></a> to release the handles in the <strong>RTM_ENTITY_INFO</strong> structures.</p>
<p>If the routing table manager client supplied a callback function in the call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rtmv2/nf-rtmv2-rtmregisterentity"><strong>RtmRegisterEntity</strong></a>, the client is notified when any other clients register or unregister.</p>
<p>For sample code that shows how to use these functions, see <a href="enumerate-the-registered-entities.html">Enumerate the Registered Entities</a> and <a href="use-the-event-notification-callback.html">Use the Event Notification Callback</a>.</p>

<h1>How the Multicast Architecture Fits Together</h1>
<p>This section describes a sample configuration and how the major components fit together.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the relationship between the various components of a router.</p>
<p><img src="images/mrarch1.png" alt="relationship between components of windows 2000 router" /></p>
<p>The multicast group manager is a part of the RRAS service that runs on a server that is operating as a router.</p>
<p>The router shown has three multicast routing protocols (Protocol 1, Protocol 2, Protocol 3) running on it. Each protocol can own one or more interfaces (in this illustration, Protocol 1 owns Interface 1, Protocol 2 owns Interface 2, and Protocol 3 owns Interface 3). Each interface can be owned by only one routing protocol (in addition to IGMP, which is a special case).</p>
<p>The multicast group manager runs on the router and coordinates the distribution of group information between the routing protocols.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the relationship between two routers in a multicast architecture.</p>
<p><img src="images/mrarch2.png" alt="relationship between two routers in multicast architecture" /></p>
<p>In the previous illustration, Router 2 sends a multicast message to Network 2 on Interface 3. Router 1 receives the multicast message from Network 2 on Interface 3. On both routers, Protocol 3 owns the respective Interface 3.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the path a message from a multicast source (to a multicast group) takes to reach the host that has joined the multicast group. The routers in the illustration use the same configuration as previous illustrations; however, the interface and protocol details are not shown in order to keep the figure simple.</p>

<p>The following scenario describes the events that take place when a host joins a multicast group. Refer to the previous illustration for relationships between the various entities.</p>
<ol>
<li>Host 1 joins the multicast group G on Network 3.</li>
<li>Router 3 learns about G via IGMP.</li>
<li>The multicast group manager on Router 3 notifies Protocol 3 on Router 3 that there are new receivers for G.</li>
<li>Protocol 3 on Router 3 then notifies Protocol 3 on Router 1 about G.</li>
<li>In turn, Protocol 3 on Router 1 notifies the multicast group manager on Router 1 about G.</li>
<li>The multicast group manager on Router 1 then notifies Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 about G.</li>
<li>Protocol 2 may inform Router 2 about G, if the protocol is designed to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following scenario describes the events that take place when a message is sent to a multicast group. Refer to the previous illustration for the relationships between the various entities.</p>
<ol>
<li>A source on Network 1 sends a message to Group G.</li>
<li>The message sent from Source S goes first to Router 2, which then forwards it to Router 1 using Interface 2 (since Router 2 has been informed by Protocol 2 that receivers are present downstream).</li>
<li>Router 1 forwards the message to Router 3 (since Router 1 has been informed by Protocol 2 that receivers are present downstream).</li>
<li>Router 3 forwards the message to Network 3, and therefore it arrives at Host 1.</li>
</ol>

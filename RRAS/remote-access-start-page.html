<h1>Remote Access</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Use Remote Access Service (RAS) to create client applications. These applications display RAS common dialog boxes, manage remote access connections and devices, and manipulate phone-book entries. RAS also provides the next generation of server functionality for the Remote Access Service (RAS) for Windows. The RRAS server functionality follows and builds upon the Remote Access Service (RAS).</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>The Remote Access Service is applicable in any computing environment that uses a Wide Area Network (WAN) link or a Virtual Private Network (VPN). RAS makes it possible to connect a remote client computer to a network server over a WAN link or a VPN. The remote computer then functions on the server's LAN as though the remote computer was connected to the LAN directly. The RAS API enables programmers to access the features of RAS programmatically.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>The RAS API is designed for use by C/C++ programmers. Microsoft Visual Basic programmers may also find the API useful. Programmers should be familiar with networking concepts.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>Some of the functions in the RAS API are supported only on network servers and other functions are supported only on network clients. For more specific information about which operating systems support a particular function, refer to the Requirements sections in the documentation.</p>
<p>The <a href="function-comparison-windows-2000-versus-rras-redistributable.html">enhanced RAS functionality</a> of RRAS is available for Windows NT Server 4.0 by installing the 'RRAS redistributable'. All the functionality of RRAS is incorporated into Windows 2000 Server, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008. RRAS applications cannot run on Windows NT Workstation 4.0 or on client operating systems, such as Windows 95. For more specific information about which operating systems support a particular function, refer to the Requirements sections in the documentation.</p>

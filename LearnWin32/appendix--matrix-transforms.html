<h2>Introduction to Matrices</h2>
<p>A matrix is a rectangular array of real numbers. The <em>order</em> of the matrix is the number of rows and columns. For example, if the matrix has 3 rows and 2 columns, the order is 3 Ã— 2. Matrices are usually shown with the matrix elements enclosed in square brackets:</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix01.png" alt="3 x 2 matrix." /></p>
<p>Notation: A matrix is designated by a capital letter. Elements are designated by lowercase letters. Subscripts indicate the row and column number of an element. For example, a<em>ij</em> is the element at the i'th row and j'th column of the matrix A.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows an i Ã— j matrix, with the individual elements in each cell of the matrix.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix15.png" alt="a matrix with i rows and j columns." /></p>
<h3>Matrix Operations</h3>
<p>This section describes the basic operations defined on matrices.</p>
<p><em>Addition</em>. The sum A + B of two matrices is obtained by adding the corresponding elements of A and B:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Scalar multiplication</em>. This operation multiplies a matrix by a real number. Given a real number <em>k</em>, the scalar product kA is obtained by multiplying every element of A by <em>k</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Matrix multiplication</em>. Given two matrices A and B with order (m Ã— n) and (n Ã— p), the product C = A Ã— B is a matrix with order (m Ã— p), defined as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix02.png" alt="Shows a formula for matrix multiplication." /></p>
<p>or, equivalently:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That is, to compute each element c<em>ij</em>, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the i'th row of A and the j'th column of B.</li>
<li>Multiply each pair of elements in the row and column: the first row entry by the first column entry, the second row entry by the second column entry, and so forth.</li>
<li>Sum the result.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of multiplying a (2 Ã— 2) matrix by a (2 Ã— 3) matrix.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix03.png" alt="matrix multiplication." /></p>
<p>Matrix multiplication is not commutative. That is, A Ã— B â‰  B Ã— A. Also, from the definition it follows that not every pair of matrices can be multiplied. The number of columns in the left-hand matrix must equal the number of rows in the right-hand matrix. Otherwise, the Ã— operator is not defined.</p>
<p><em>Identify matrix</em>. An identity matrix, designated I, is a square matrix defined as follows:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In other words, an identity matrix contains 1 for each element where the row number equals the column number, and zero for all other elements. For example, here is the 3 Ã— 3 identity matrix.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix04.png" alt="identity matrix." /></p>
<p>The following equalities hold for any matrix M.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2>Affine Transforms</h2>
<p>An <em>affine transform</em> is a mathematical operation that maps one coordinate space to another. In other words, it maps one set of points to another set of points. Affine transforms have some features that make them useful in computer graphics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Affine transforms preserve <em>collinearity</em>. If three or more points fall on a line, they still form a line after the transformation. Straight lines remain straight.</li>
<li>The composition of two affine transforms is an affine transform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Affine transforms for 2-D space have the following form.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix05.png" alt="Shows an affine transform for 2-D space." /></p>
<p>If you apply the definition of matrix multiplication given earlier, you can show that the product of two affine transforms is another affine transform. To transform a 2D point using an affine transform, the point is represented as a 1 Ã— 3 matrix.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first two elements contain the x and y coordinates of the point. The 1 is placed in the third element to make the math work out correctly. To apply the transform, multiply the two matrices as follows.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This expands to the following.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix06.png" alt="affine transform." /></p>
<p>where</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To get the transformed point, take the first two elements of matrix P'.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
A 1 Ã—Â <em>n</em> matrix is called a <em>row vector</em>. Direct2D and Direct3D both use row vectors to represent points in 2D or 3D space. You can get an equivalent result by using a column vector (<em>n</em>Â Ã— 1) and transposing the transform matrix. Most graphics texts use the column vector form. This topic presents the row vector form for consistency with Direct2D and Direct3D.</p>

<p>The next several sections derive the basic transforms.</p>
<h3>Translation Transform</h3>
<p>The translation transform matrix has the following form.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix07.png" alt="translation transform." /></p>
<p>Plugging a point <em>P</em> into this equation yields:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>which corresponds to the point (x, y) translated by <em>dx</em> in the X-axis and <em>dy</em> in the Y-axis.</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics22.png" alt="a diagram that shows translation of two points." /></p>
<h3>Scaling Transform</h3>
<p>The scaling transform matrix has the following form.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix09.png" alt="scaling transform." /></p>
<p>Plugging a point <em>P</em> into this equation yields:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>which corresponds to the point (x,y) scaled by <em>dx</em> and <em>dy</em>.</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics23.png" alt="a diagram that shows scaling of two points." /></p>
<h3>Rotation Around the Origin</h3>
<p>The matrix to rotate a point around the origin has the following form.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix11.png" alt="Shows a formula for a rotation transform." /></p>
<p>The transformed point is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Proof. To show that P' represents a rotation, consider the following diagram.</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics24.png" alt="a diagram that shows rotation around the origin." /></p>
<p>Given:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->P = (x,y)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The original point to transform.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Î¦</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The angle formed by the line (0,0) to P.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Î˜</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The angle by which to rotate (x,y) about the origin.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->P' = (x',y')</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The transformed point.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->R</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The length of the line (0,0) to P. Also the radius of the circle of rotation.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
This diagram uses the standard coordinate system used in geometry, where the positive y-axis points up. Direct2D uses the Windows coordinate system, where the positive y-axis points down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The angle between the x-axis and the line (0,0) to P' is Î¦ + Î˜. The following identities hold:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now solve for x' and y' in terms of Î˜. By the trigonometric addition formulas:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Substituting, we get:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>which corresponds to the transformed point P' shown earlier.</p>
<h3>Rotation Around an Arbitrary Point</h3>
<p>To rotate around a point (x,y) other than the origin, the following matrix is used.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix13.png" alt="rotation transform." /></p>
<p>You can derive this matrix by taking the point (x,y) to be the origin.</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics25.png" alt="a diagram that shows rotation around a point." /></p>
<p>Let (x1, y1) be the point that results from rotating the point (x0, y0) around the point (x,y). We can derive x1 as follows.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now plug this equation back into the transform matrix, using the formula x1 = ax0 + cy0 + e from earlier. Use the same procedure to derive y1.</p>
<h3>Skew Transform</h3>
<p>The skew transform is defined by four parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Î˜: The amount to skew along the x-axis, measured as an angle from the y-axis.</li>
<li>Î¦: The amount to skew along the y-axis, measured as an angle from the x-axis.</li>
<li>(<em>px</em>, <em>py</em>): The x- and y-coordinates of the point about which the skew is performed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The skew transform uses the following matrix.</p>
<p><img src="images/matrix14.png" alt="skew transform." /></p>
<p>The transformed point is:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>or equivalently:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To see how this transform works, consider each component individually. The Î˜ parameter moves every point in the x direction by an amount equal to tanÎ˜. The following diagram shows the relation between Î˜ and the x-axis skew.</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics26.png" alt="Diagram that shows skew along the x-axis." /></p>
<p>Here is the same skew applied to a rectangle:</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics27.png" alt="Diagram that shows skew along the x-axis when applied to a rectangle." /></p>
<p>The Î¦ parameter has the same effect, but along the y-axis:</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics28.png" alt="Diagram that shows skew along the y-axis." /></p>
<p>The next diagram shows y-axis skew applied to a rectangle.</p>
<p><img src="images/graphics29.png" alt="Diagram that shows skew along the y-axis when applied to a rectangle." /></p>
<p>Finally, the parameters <em>px</em> and <em>py</em> shift the center point for the skew along the x- and y-axes.</p>
<h2>Representing Transforms in Direct2D</h2>
<p>All Direct2D transforms are affine transforms. Direct2D does not support non-affine transforms. Transforms are represented by the <a href="/windows/desktop/Direct2D/d2d1-matrix-3x2-f"><strong>D2D1_MATRIX_3X2_F</strong></a> structure. This structure defines a 3 Ã— 2 matrix. Because the third column of an affine transform is always the same ([0, 0, 1]), and because Direct2D does not support non-affine transforms, there is no need to specify the entire 3 Ã— 3 matrix. Internally, Direct2D uses 3 Ã— 3 matrices to compute the transforms.</p>
<p>The members of the <a href="/windows/desktop/Direct2D/d2d1-matrix-3x2-f"><strong>D2D1_MATRIX_3X2_F</strong></a> are named according to their index position: the <strong>_11</strong> member is element (1,1), the <strong>_12</strong> member is element (1,2), and so forth. Although you can initialize the structure members directly, it is recommended to use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d2d1helper/nl-d2d1helper-matrix3x2f"><strong>D2D1::Matrix3x2F</strong></a> class. This class inherits <strong>D2D1_MATRIX_3X2_F</strong> and provides helper methods for creating any of the basic affine transforms. The class also defines <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d2d1helper/nf-d2d1helper-matrix3x2f-operator-mult"><strong>operator*()</strong></a> for composing two or more transforms, as described in <a href="applying-transforms-in-direct2d.html">Applying Transforms in Direct2D</a>.</p>

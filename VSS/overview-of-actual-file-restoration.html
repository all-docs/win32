<h1>Overview of Actual File Restoration</h1>
<p>After performing the actions described in <a href="overview-of-restore-initialization.html">Overview of Restore Initialization</a> and <a href="overview-of-preparing-for-restore.html">Overview of Preparing for Restore</a>, the requester has sufficient information to begin restoring files. File restoration does not involve writer interactions or the generation of events. For more information, see <a href="overview-of-processing-a-restore-under-vss.html">Overview of Processing a Restore Under VSS</a>.</p>
<p>The following table shows the sequence of actions and events that are required to restore files.</p>

<h2>Requester Actions during Restoring Files</h2>
<p>For most files on the backup media, the requester needs to determine their original locations and any new locations or alternate location mappings that apply to them. (See <a href="generating-a-restore-set.html">Generating a Restore Set</a> for a discussion of best practices in determining which files to restore and where to restore them.)</p>
<p>In addition, some files may have <a href="vssgloss-d.html"><em>directed targets</em></a> or support <a href="vssgloss-p.html"><em>partial file</em></a> restoration. The number of such files can be found by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getdirectedtargetcount"><strong>IVssComponent::GetDirectedTargetCount</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getpartialfilecount"><strong>IVssComponent::GetPartialFileCount</strong></a>, and information on detailed restoration instructions can be found by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-adddirectedtarget"><strong>IVssComponent::AddDirectedTarget</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getpartialfile"><strong>IVssComponent::GetPartialFile</strong></a>. (Partial and directed files can be part of components added implicitly or explicitly to the original backup, see <a href="working-with-selectability-for-restore-and-subcomponents.html">Working with Selectability For Restore and Subcomponents</a> for more information.)</p>
<p>Success or failure of a restore is indicated on a component-by-component basis using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setfilerestorestatus"><strong>IVssBackupComponents::SetFileRestoreStatus</strong></a>. The need for further restore operations (in the case of incremental or differential restores) is also indicated on a component-by-component basis using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setadditionalrestores"><strong>IVssBackupComponents::SetAdditionalRestores</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In general, VSS does not specify a mechanism for retrieving data from a storage media, a choice of storage medium, or how to determine which files should be restored where.</p>
<p>However, for certain writers, restoring files may involve the use of a documented custom interface and procedure. Windows system writers, which currently require such support, are documented in <a href="special-vss-usage-cases.html">Special VSS Usage Cases</a>.</p>
<p>In general, it is recommended that the files of each component of each <a href="vssgloss-w.html"><em>writer instance</em></a> be processed as a unit. This requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associating each file to be restored with the component that managed it. This requires the use of Writer Metadata Documents.</li>
<li>Obtaining correct restoration target information. This requires information from the Backup Components Document.</li>
</ul>

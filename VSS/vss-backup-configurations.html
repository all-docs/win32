<h1>VSS Backup Configurations</h1>
<p>There are a number of conventionally supported backup typesâ€”incremental, differential, and fullâ€”that VSS is aware of, as well as a backup configuration peculiar to VSS.</p>
<p>In defining a backup configuration, a requester and the writers on a system indicate how data will be written to a storage device, how the shadow copy mechanism will be deployed, and what information needs to be saved. Interaction between writers and requesters is determined by the type of backup a requester wants to perform and the kinds (or schemas) that each writer can support:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="vss-backup-state.html">VSS Backup State</a></li>
<li><a href="writer-backup-schema-support.html">Writer Backup Schema Support</a></li>
<li><a href="file-level-schema-support.html">File Level Schema Support</a></li>
</ul>

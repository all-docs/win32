<h1>Working with Selectability and Logical Paths</h1>
<p>A writer's participation in a backup or restore operation, and which of its data are saved, depends on which of its components are <a href="vssgloss-e.html"><em>explicitly included</em></a> as part of a requester's Backup Components Document and the relationship between those components and the logical path of other components within the Writer Metadata Document.</p>
<p>Writers with no components added to a requester's Backup Component Document prior to the generation of a <a href="vssgloss-p.html"><em>PrepareForBackup</em></a> event (in the case of backup operations) or of a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-prerestore"><strong>PreRestore</strong></a> event (in the case of restore operations) receive no events after this point and will not participate in the backup or restore operation.</p>
<p>However, a requester's freedom to include or exclude any given component in a backup or restore is governed by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any hierarchy that exists between the components managed by a writer and expressed by <a href="vssgloss-l.html"><em>logical paths</em></a></li>
<li>Whether the component is designated as being <a href="vssgloss-s.html"><em>selectable for backup</em></a></li>
<li>Whether it is designated as being <a href="vssgloss-s.html"><em>selectable for restore</em></a></li>
<li>Whether an explicit dependency exists between a given component in a given writer and other components in other writers</li>
</ul>

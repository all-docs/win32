<h1>VSS Metadata</h1>
<p>Both writers and requesters maintain information necessary to a backup or restore operation in their own metadata documents.</p>
<p>These documents, the <a href="vssgloss-w.html"><em>Writer Metadata Document</em></a> and the <a href="vssgloss-b.html"><em>Backup Components Document</em></a>, respectively, are used as the basis for writer and requester communication and coordination during backup and restore activities.</p>
<p>The metadata is represented in XML format using a proprietary schema. Metadata can be copied to disk, tape, or any other mass storage device. It should always be saved to the backup media during a backup operation, and will need to be retrieved from that media in the course of a restore operation.</p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> The specific details of the format and schema are for system use only. Developers should not attempt to modify or directly use the XML representation of the metadata.</p>
<p>Writers and requesters are provided with a variety of query and set methods to access and modify the Backup Components and Writer Metadata documents:</p>
<ul>

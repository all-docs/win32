<h1>In-Box VSS Writers</h1>
<p>The Windows operating system includes a set of VSS writers that are responsible for enumerating the data that is required by various Windows features. These are referred to as &quot;in-box&quot; writers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The MSDE in-box writer is not available in WindowsÂ Vista, Windows ServerÂ 2008, and later. Instead, the SQL Writer should be used to back up SQL Server databases. Only SQL Server 2005 SP2 and later are supported on WindowsÂ Vista, Windows ServerÂ 2008, and later.</p>

<h2>Active Directory Domain Services (NTDS) VSS Writer</h2>
<p>This writer reports the NTDS database file (ntds.dit) and the associated log files. These files are required to restore the Active Directory correctly.</p>
<p>There is only one ntds.dit file per domain controller, and it is reported in the writer metadata as in the following example:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>    &lt;DATABASE_FILES path=&quot;C:\Windows\NTDS&quot; 
                     filespec=&quot;ntds.dit&quot; 
                     filespecBackupType=&quot;3855&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example that shows how to list components in the writer's metadata:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>    &lt;BACKUP_LOCATIONS&gt;
        &lt;DATABASE logicalPath=&quot;C:_Windows_NTDS&quot; 
                     componentName=&quot;ntds&quot; 
                     caption=&quot;&quot; restoreMetadata=&quot;no&quot; 
                     notifyOnBackupComplete=&quot;no&quot; 
                     selectable=&quot;no&quot; 
                     selectableForRestore=&quot;no&quot; 
                     componentFlags=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;DATABASE_FILES path=&quot;C:\Windows\NTDS&quot; 
                     filespec=&quot;ntds.dit&quot; 
                     filespecBackupType=&quot;3855&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;DATABASE_LOGFILES path=&quot;C:\Windows\NTDS&quot; 
                     filespec=&quot;edb*.log&quot; 
                     filespecBackupType=&quot;3855&quot;/&gt; 
        &lt;DATABASE_LOGFILES path=&quot;C:\Windows\NTDS&quot; 
                     filespec=&quot;edb.chk&quot; 
                     filespecBackupType=&quot;3855&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/DATABASE&gt;
    &lt;/BACKUP_LOCATIONS&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At backup time, the writer sets the backup expiration time in the writer's backup metadata. Requesters should retrieve this metadata by using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getbackupmetadata"><strong>IVssComponent::GetBackupMetadata</strong></a> to determine whether the database has expired. Expired databases cannot be restored.</p>
<p>If the computer that contains the NTDS database is a domain controller, the backup application should always perform a system state backup across all volumes containing critical system state information. At restore time, the application should first restart the computer in Directory Services Restore Mode and then perform a system state restore.</p>
<p>The writer name string for this writer is &quot;NTDS&quot;.</p>

<h2>System Writer</h2>
<p>The system writer enumerates all operating system and driver binaries and it is required for a system state backup.</p>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP:</strong> This writer is not supported.</p>
<p>This writer runs as part of the Cryptographic Services (CryptSvc) service. The system writer generates a file list that contains the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All static files that have been installed. A static file is a file that is listed in the component manifest with the <strong>writeableType</strong> file attribute set to &quot;static&quot; or &quot;&quot;. Static files include all files that are protected by Windows Resource Protection (WRP). However, not all static files are WRP-protected files. For example, game files are static but not WRP-protected so that administrators can change parental control settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contents of the Windows Side-by-Side (WinSxS) directory, including all manifests, optional components, and third-party Win32 files.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Many of the files in the %windir%\system32 directory are hard links to files in the WinSxS directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All PnP files for installed drivers (owned by PnP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All user-mode services and non-PnP drivers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All catalogs owned by CryptSvc.</p>

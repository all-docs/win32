<h1>Writer Metadata Document Life Cycle</h1>
<p>In response to an <a href="vssgloss-i.html"><em>Identify event</em></a>, each writer present on the system constructs its own Writer Metadata Document using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata"><strong>IVssCreateWriterMetadata</strong></a>. An <em>Identify event</em> is typically generated by a requester calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-gatherwritermetadata"><strong>IVssBackupComponents::GatherWriterMetadata</strong></a>.</p>
<p>When creating a Writer Metadata Document, either through the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata"><strong>IVssCreateWriterMetadata</strong></a> interface or through writer initialization (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-initialize"><strong>CVssWriter::Initialize</strong></a>), a writer must explicitly specify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="vssgloss-r.html"><em>Restore method</em></a></li>
<li>Writer name</li>
<li><a href="vssgloss-w.html"><em>Writer class ID</em></a></li>
<li>Data usage (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/ne-vswriter-vss_usage_type"><strong>VSS_USAGE_TYPE</strong></a>)</li>
<li>Date source type (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/ne-vswriter-vss_source_type"><strong>VSS_SOURCE_TYPE</strong></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, it may also specify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components (which may or may not contain file sets)</li>
<li>Add alternate mappings</li>
<li>Exclude file lists</li>
</ul>
<p>An overview of Writer Metadata Document creation is found in <a href="overview-of-backup-initialization.html">Writer Actions during Backup Initialization</a>.</p>
<p>Requesters typically make use of one of two methods to obtain access to writer metadata:</p>
<ul>
<li>During most backup operations, a requester uses <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-getwritermetadata"><strong>IVssBackupComponents::GetWriterMetadata</strong></a> to obtain an instance of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nl-vsbackup-ivssexaminewritermetadata"><strong>IVssExamineWriterMetadata</strong></a> interface to allow access to the metadata of a currently executing writer.</li>
<li>For restore operations, or backups using imported shadow copies (see <a href="importing-transportable-shadow-copied-volumes.html">Importing Transportable Shadow Copied Volumes</a> for more information on importing shadow copies), a requester retrieves an XML document containing the metadata and uses <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-createvssexaminewritermetadata"><strong>CreateVssExamineWriterMetadata</strong></a> to obtain an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nl-vsbackup-ivssexaminewritermetadata"><strong>IVssExamineWriterMetadata</strong></a> interface, which it uses to read the restore metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>Writer Metadata Documents enable the requester performing a backup to learn about currently executing writers during the discovery phase of a backup.</p>
<p>For those writers chosen to participate in a backup, a requester imports much, but not all, of the information in the Writer Metadata Document into its own Backup Components Document during the discovery phase of a backup.</p>
<p>However, only Writer Metadata Documents and not the Backup Components Document contain the file and path specifications.</p>
<p>For more information on how the discovery phase of a backup operation is conducted, see <a href="overview-of-the-backup-discovery-phase.html">Overview of the Backup Discovery Phase</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, only <a href="vssgloss-e.html"><em>explicitly included</em></a> components have their information stored in the Backup Components Document during a backup operation. Information on <a href="vssgloss-i.html"><em>implicitly included</em></a> components is not included in the Backup Components Document during a backup operation, and must be interpolated using information about the explicitly included components and the available Writer Metadata Documents.</p>
<p>Implicitly included components may still be <a href="vssgloss-s.html"><em>selectable for restore</em></a> and may need to be explicitly included in the Backup Components Document at restore time. In this case, just as adding a component during a backup operation required access to the component's writer's Writer Metadata Document (then retrieved from the writer), a requester will require access to a copy of that writer's Writer Metadata Documents stored at backup time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way to obtain all the information about all the files and components involved in a backup or restore is to have each Writer Metadata Document for each writer participating in a backup stored along with the Backup Components Document.

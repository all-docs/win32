<h1>Working with the Backup Components Document</h1>
<p>A requester creates a Backup Components Document at the start of performing a backup. The document initially contains only a description of the state of the backup operation. During restore, the document should provide instructions on how a requester should proceed in copying files back to disk. In the course of the restore operation, the Backup Components Document is modified and contains the state of that operation.</p>
<p>Unlike the Writer Metadata Document, which is read-only, there is a window in which the Backup Components Document can be modified by both requesters and writers. The document can be updated until the generation of a <a href="vssgloss-b.html"><em>BackupComplete</em></a> or <a href="vssgloss-b.html"><em>BackupShutdown</em></a> event during backup operations, and until a <a href="vssgloss-p.html"><em>PostRestore</em></a> event during restores.</p>
<p>To use a requester's Backup Components Document requires an understanding of the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="backup-components-document-life-cycle.html">Backup Components Document Life Cycle</a></li>
<li><a href="backup-components-document-contents.html">Backup Components Document Contents</a></li>
</ul>

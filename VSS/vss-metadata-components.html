<h1>VSS Metadata Components</h1>
<p>Critical to organizing which files of which writer are to be backed up or restored is the concept of a <a href="vssgloss-c.html"><em>component</em></a>.</p>
<p>Components allow a writer to indicate to a backup engine how its files are to be organized, dependencies between files, and what type of data those files can contain. This allows a backup engine to decide how to store files for maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, VSS-based applications use components as the building blocks for their metadata and the medium for writer/requester communication.</p>
<p>Writers and requesters store information about components separatelyâ€”in the Writer Metadata Document and the Backup Components Document, respectivelyâ€”and the information differs in each representation.</p>
<p>Component information in Writer Metadata Documents includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information from only one writer in each document</li>
<li>All of that writer's components, whether they can be <a href="vssgloss-e.html"><em>explicitly included</em></a> or must be <a href="vssgloss-i.html"><em>implicitly included</em></a> in a backup or restore operation</li>
<li><a href="vssgloss-l.html"><em>Logical path</em></a> information used to associate a selectable for backup component with particular nonselectable for backup components, thus forming a component set</li>
<li>The <a href="vssgloss-f.html"><em>file set</em></a> informationâ€”path, file specification, and recursion flagâ€”managed for each component</li>
</ul>
<p>Writer Metadata Documents also contain writer-level metadata information, such as restore methods and alternate location mappings for restore. Writer Metadata Documents are read-only. The interface for examining this information is <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nl-vsbackup-ivsswmcomponent"><strong>IVssWMComponent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Component information in Backup Components Documents includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only information on explicitly included components</li>
<li>Writer-level metadata information, such as alternate location mappings and restore</li>
<li>State information describing a backup or restore operation</li>
</ul>
<p>Backup Component Documents do not contain information on components' <a href="vssgloss-f.html"><em>file sets</em></a>. Backup Component Documents are not read-only and can be modified by the writer. The interface for accessing this information is <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscomponent"><strong>IVssComponent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The life cycle and relationship between the two expressions of a component can be understood as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writers are responsible for the initial definitions of components.</li>
<li>A requester examines the metadata of all writers and their components.</li>
<li>From components' selectability and logical path information, a requester determines which components must be explicitly included, which may be explicitly included, which define component sets, and which are members of component sets.</li>
<li>A requester adds those components that require explicit inclusion, and implicitly includes subcomponents in <a href="/windows"><em>component sets</em></a> (whose information is not in the Backup Components Document).</li>
<li>When handling events, writers and requesters may modify and examine the component information stored in the Backup Components Document to coordinate their activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the writer and the requester versions component information are required to properly execute backup and restore operations, and both must be stored with any backed-up data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="component-types.html">Component Types</a></li>
<li><a href="definition-of-components-by-writers.html">Definition of Components by Writers</a></li>
<li><a href="use-of-components-by-the-requestor.html">Use of Components by the Requester</a></li>
</ul>

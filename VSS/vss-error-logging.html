<h1>VSS Error Logging</h1>
<p>The following VSS error and state information is written to the Application Event Log:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requester errors produced using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nl-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents"><strong>IVssBackupComponents</strong></a> interface</li>
<li>Writer errors produced in using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-cvsswriter"><strong>CVssWriter</strong></a> class, including overriding methods</li>
<li>Default-provider-generated errors</li>
<li>VSS service errors generated in coordinating provider, writer, and requester activity (such as the generation of events)</li>
</ul>
<p>These errors might have a number of causes, including a programming error in third-party code or VSS-related configuration errors.</p>
<p>VSS drivers and lower-level implementation functionality write errors to the System Log. Third-party software (requester, provider, writer) can choose the Application Log, the System Log, or both, to write error log entries.</p>
<p>It is recommended that high-level applications (such as user-mode code) use the Application Log. Lower-level applications, such as hardware interfaces and drivers, should use the System Log.</p>

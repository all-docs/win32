<h2>Porting Windows Server 2003 SP1 Backup Applications to Windows Vista</h2>
<p>Binaries from Windows ServerÂ 2003 with SP1 are compatible with WindowsÂ Vista and Windows ServerÂ 2008. However, most Windows ServerÂ 2003 with SP1 backup applications must be updated to account for new features, which are described in the following sections.</p>
<h2>Compiling Backup Applications for Windows Vista</h2>

<h1>Volume Shadow Copy Service</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) is a set of COM interfaces that implements a framework to allow volume backups to be performed while applications on a system continue to write to the volumes.</p>
<p>For an introduction to VSS for system administrators, see <a href="/windows-server/storage/file-server/volume-shadow-copy-service">Volume Shadow Copy Service</a> in the TechNet Library.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>VSS is supported on Microsoft WindowsÂ XP and later. For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the documentation for that element.</p>
<p>All 32-bit VSS applications (requesters, providers, and writers) must run as native 32-bit or 64-bit applications. Running them under WOW64 is not supported. For more information, see <a href="usage-conventions.html">Supported Configurations and Restrictions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP:</strong> Running 32-bit VSS requesters under WOW64 is supported, but not for system-state backups. Running 32-bit VSS providers and writers under WOW64 is not supported. Support for running 32-bit requesters under WOW64 was removed in WindowsÂ Vista and subsequent versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
A shadow copy that was created on Windows ServerÂ 2003Â R2 or Windows ServerÂ 2003 cannot be used on a computer that is running Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2 or Windows ServerÂ 2008. A shadow copy that was created on Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2 or Windows ServerÂ 2008 cannot be used on a computer that is running Windows ServerÂ 2003. However, a shadow copy that was created on Windows ServerÂ 2008 can be used on a computer that is running Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2, and vice versa.</p>

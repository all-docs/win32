<h1>Logical Pathing of Components</h1>
<p><a href="vssgloss-l.html"><em>Logical pathing</em></a> is used to organize components managed by a writer into well-defined groups.</p>
<p>The logical path is analogous in structure to traditional file pathing, using the backslash &quot;\&quot; to separate elements in the path. Unlike file paths, the root of a logical path is <strong>NULL</strong>, instead of &quot;\&quot;.</p>
<p>The logical path is expressed as a <strong>NULL</strong>-terminated string, and there are no other restrictions on the characters the path can contain.</p>
<p>The most important use of logical pathing is in defining <a href="vssgloss-c.html"><em>component sets</em></a>, where the <a href="vssgloss-e.html"><em>explicit component inclusion</em></a> in a backup or restore operation of one selectable component requires the inclusion of a number of other components (<a href="vssgloss-s.html"><em>subcomponent</em></a>). The logical path of the defining component of a component set is a parent to the logical paths of its subcomponents and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subcomponents must share as a root path the logical path of the selectable component that defines the component set.</li>
<li>A root path of <strong>NULL</strong> is valid.</li>
<li>The name of the defining selectable component must be the first logical path element after the root path for every nonselectable subcomponent of the component set.</li>
<li>Component sets can be nested.</li>
<li>The combination of logical path and component name must be unique across all instances of a <a href="vssgloss-w.html"><em>writer class</em></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hypothetical example of a writer <em>MyWriter</em> with a logical path structure defined below illustrates logical pathing.</p>

<p>Note that the components &quot;Executables&quot; and &quot;ConfigFile&quot; have a parent-child relationship, but both are nonselectable. Therefore, they do not form a component set. Whenever the writer <em>MyWriter</em> is backed up or restored, these two components will have to be <a href="vssgloss-e.html"><em>explicitly included</em></a> in the operation.</p>
<p>The component &quot;LicenseInfo&quot; is selectable with neither ancestor nor descendant. It can be explicitly included, or not, in a backup or restore operation at the discretion of the requester.</p>
<p>The component &quot;Security&quot; defines a simple component set, containing no component sets beneath it.</p>
<p>The component &quot;writerData&quot; defines a component set, which contains a complex collection of components with several well-defined logical path hierarchies beneath it.</p>
<p>One subcomponent, &quot;Usage&quot;, is selectable and defines a component set.</p>
<p>Several components have the same name and are distinguished by their logical paths. Instances of the nonselectable components &quot;Dec&quot; and &quot;Jan&quot; exist under the components nonselectable components &quot;Set1&quot; and &quot;Set2&quot; and under the selectable subcomponent &quot;Usage&quot;.</p>
<p>If the component &quot;writerData&quot; is explicitly included in a backup or restore, then all of its subcomponentsâ€”even those in the nested component set defined by &quot;Usage&quot;â€”will be <a href="vssgloss-e.html"><em>implicitly included</em></a><a href="vssgloss-i.html"><em>implicitly included</em></a> in the operation.</p>
<p>If the component set defined by &quot;writerData&quot; is not explicitly included in a backup or restore, components &quot;Set1&quot;, &quot;Set2&quot;, and &quot;QueryLogs&quot; (and their instances of subcomponents &quot;Dec&quot; and &quot;Jan&quot;) will not be included implicitly in the backup or restore operation.</p>
<p>However, even if &quot;writerData&quot; is not included in the operation, the component &quot;Usage&quot; is still selectable, and it can still be explicitly included in a backup or restore operation. If it is, then its subcomponents &quot;Jan&quot; and &quot;Dec&quot; will be implicitly included.</p>
<p>Other points worthy of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The selectable components &quot;LicenseInfo&quot; and &quot;writerData&quot; and the nonselectable component &quot;Executables&quot; are all at the same level in <em>MyWriter</em>'s logical path hierarchy: all have the same logical path of <strong>NULL</strong> or &quot;&quot;, the root logical path.</li>
<li>The selectable component &quot;Usage&quot; should never be explicitly included in a backup, if its selectable parent (&quot;writerData&quot;) is explicitly included in a backup or restore operation.</li>
<li>Components that define component sets may exist simply for organizational reasons. For instance, either the &quot;writerData&quot; or the &quot;Usage&quot; component, or both, might be empty; that is, no <a href="vssgloss-f.html"><em>file sets</em></a> were added to them using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-addfilestofilegroup"><strong>IVssCreateWriterMetadata::AddFilesToFileGroup</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-adddatabasefiles"><strong>IVssCreateWriterMetadata::AddDatabaseFiles</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-adddatabaselogfiles"><strong>IVssCreateWriterMetadata::AddDatabaseLogFiles</strong></a> method. The components still define a component set.</li>
</ul>

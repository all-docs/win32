<h1>New Functionality Available in Windows Server 2003</h1>
<p>The Windows Server 2003 release of the Volume Shadow Copy Service contains the following new functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for <a href="vssgloss-s.html"><em>selectability for restore</em></a> in addition to and on an equal basis with <a href="vssgloss-s.html"><em>selectability for backup</em></a> (previously just referred to as selectability). See <a href="working-with-selectability-and-logical-paths.html">Working with Selectability and Logical Paths</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Introduction of a <a href="vssgloss-b.html"><em>BackupShutdown</em></a> event indicating that a VSS-compliant backup application (requester) has shut down, whether the backup attempt has properly completed or not. See <a href="handling-backupshutdown-events.html">Handling BackupShutdown Events</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Support for explicit writer-component dependencies. A means for describing and supporting the situations where a component (and the component set it defines) managed by one writer cannot be backed up or restore independently of components managed by other writers. See <a href="dependencies-between-components-managed-by-different-writers.html">Dependencies between Components Managed by Different Writers</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Full support for <a href="vssgloss-p.html"><em>partial files</em></a> operations. The backup and restore of segments of files by writers and requesters is now fully supported. See <a href="working-with-partial-files.html">Working with Partial Files</a> for more information on partial file operations.</li>
<li>Introduction of <a href="vssgloss-d.html"><em>differenced files</em></a> to support incremental backup and restore operations. See <a href="incremental-and-differential-backups.html">Incremental and Differential Backups</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Introduction of backup schemas as a concept indicating the level of writer support for types of backup operations. See <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vss/ne-vss-vss_backup_schema"><strong>VSS_BACKUP_SCHEMA</strong></a> for more information.</li>
<li>Support for requester specification of new file restore destinations (<a href="vssgloss-n.html"><em>new target locations</em></a>) during restore operations. See <a href="working-with-new-targets-during-restore.html">Working with New Targets during Restore</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Support for conditional restore at reboot time. See VSS_RME_RESTORE_AT_REBOOT_IF_CANNOT_REPLACE (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/ne-vswriter-vss_restoremethod_enum"><strong>VSE_RESTOREMETHOD_ENUM</strong></a>) for more information.</li>
<li>Definition of a restore state and restore type. See <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vss/ne-vss-vss_restore_type"><strong>VSS_RESTORE_TYPE</strong></a> and <a href="vss-restore-state.html">VSS Restore State</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Support for writer queries about shadow copy state. See <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-getcontext"><strong>CVssWriter::GetContext</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-cvsswriter-getsnapshotdevicename"><strong>CVssWriter::GetSnapshotDeviceName</strong></a> for more information.</li>
<li>Support for transportable shadow copies in Windows ServerÂ 2003, Enterprise Edition and Windows ServerÂ 2003, Datacenter Edition. For more information, see <a href="importing-transportable-shadow-copied-volumes.html">Importing Transportable Shadow Copied Volumes</a>.</li>

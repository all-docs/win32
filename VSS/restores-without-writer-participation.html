<h1>Restores without Writer Participation</h1>
<p>Writer participation in a VSS backup is designed to allow applications to control what and how their restore data is to be used.</p>
<p>In general, if a writer is available on a system, it is never advisable to restore data to its original location without writer participation. Such a restore would likely encounter locked destination files and runs a significant risk of corrupting data.</p>
<p>However, there are reasons why a backup application might want or need to restore a VSS backup without writer participation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Data is managed by VSS-unaware applications. Almost every system will have some applicationsâ€”text editors, mail readers, word processors, and so forthâ€”that are VSS unaware. This data cannot be restored using writer participation.</p>
<p>Generally, this type of data is not system- or service-critical, and restoring it should not be problematic, or at least no more problematic than during a conventional restore.</p>
<p>As with preparations for conventional restores, if possible, restore operators should attempt to suspend or terminate such applications prior to starting a VSS restore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Missing VSS writers. This situation may be fairly common when restoring the state of a damaged system. A backup operation must determine whether it is desirable to restore files for missing writers. If restoration is desirable, the files can be restored just as a conventional backup would restore them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A private restore of a writer's data. A requester may choose to restore the data of a running writer to some private location without notifying the writer. An example of this might be restoration of the writer's data to support offline comparison. In this sort of situation, a requester would not want to use the <a href="vssgloss-n.html"><em>new target location</em></a> while doing the restore, because it does not want the writer to access the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A writer does not want to be involved during restore. A writer indicates this by passing in VSS_WRE_NEVER for the <em>writerRestore</em> parameter of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-setrestoremethod"><strong>IVssCreateWriterMetadata::SetRestoreMethod</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A writer requires a custom restore method. A writer indicates that it requires a custom restore by passing in VSS_RME_CUSTOM for the <em>method</em> parameter of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscreatewritermetadata-setrestoremethod"><strong>IVssCreateWriterMetadata::SetRestoreMethod</strong></a>. In this case, this writer should not be involved in the restore process unless the custom-restore documentation for that writer indicates otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A requester involves a writer in the restore process by specifying one of that writer's components in a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsBackup/nf-vsbackup-ivssbackupcomponents-setselectedforrestore"><strong>IVssBackupComponents::SetSelectedForRestore</strong></a>. A writer's data can be restored without involving the writer by simply not specifying any of that writer's components in a call to <strong>IVssBackupComponents::SetSelectedForRestore</strong>. If a writer does not expect any restore events, involving that writer in the restore process can cause spurious errors to be reported for that writer.</p>

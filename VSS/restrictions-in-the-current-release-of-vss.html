<h1>Restrictions in Windows Server 2003</h1>
<p>Certain functionality planned for the Windows Server 2003 release of VSS is not fully supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>During backup operations, multiple instances of a given writer class are allowed only if only one of those instances has a writer restore state (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/ne-vswriter-vss_writerrestore_enum"><strong>VSS_WRITERRESTORE_ENUM</strong></a>) other than VSS_WRE_NEVER. If this condition is met, all writer instances will participate fully during the backup, generating Writer Metadata Documents and participating in event handling.</li>
<li>During restore operations, only one writer will receive restore events generated by the requester. If more than one instance of a writer class has a writer restore state set to something other than VSS_WRE_NEVER, only one instance will receive restore events. Which instance will receive them is indeterminate.</li>
</ul>

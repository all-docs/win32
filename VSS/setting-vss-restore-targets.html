<h1>Setting VSS Restore Targets</h1>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscomponent"><strong>IVssComponent</strong></a> interface enables a writer to fine-tune exactly how files are restored on a component-by-component basis.</p>
<p>Because it is possible that the system configuration during restore is something other than that anticipated during backup, the restore target mechanism is provided.</p>
<p>It allows writers to call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-setrestoretarget"><strong>IVssComponent::SetRestoreTarget</strong></a> to change how those components that are <a href="vssgloss-e.html"><em>explicitly included</em></a> in the Backup Components Document are restored. This also changes the restoration mechanism used on those components that are <a href="vssgloss-i.html"><em>implicitly included</em></a>.</p>
<p>File restoration that takes place during a system reboot (under the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/ne-vswriter-vss_restoremethod_enum"><strong>VSS_RESTOREMETHOD_ENUM</strong></a> enumeration values VSS_RME_RESTORE_AT_REBOOT and VSS_RME_RESTORE_AT_REBOOT_IF_CANNOT_REPLACE) cannot be affected by restore targets because there are no running VSS services when <strong>MoveFileEx</strong> copies files to their final location.</p>
<p>Similarly, VSS_RME_CUSTOM restores may or may not be affected, because each custom restore is specific to a given writer and can choose to respect or ignore restore targets.</p>
<p>Requesters and writers can use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nf-vswriter-ivsscomponent-getrestoretarget"><strong>IVssComponent::GetRestoreTarget</strong></a> to check the restore target of a component set.</p>
<p><a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/nl-vswriter-ivsscomponent"><strong>IVssComponent</strong></a> supports the following restore targets, which can be set on a component set by component set basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>VSS_RT_ORIGINAL. The restore method specified by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/VsWriter/ne-vswriter-vss_restoremethod_enum"><strong>VSS_RESTOREMETHOD_ENUM</strong></a> enumeration will be respected.</li>
<li>VSS_RT_ALTERNATE. The files are restored to a location determined from an existing alternate location mapping. If an alternate location mapping matching a path in a component set subcomponent exists, restore to the alternate location if possible; otherwise, return an error.</li>
</ul>

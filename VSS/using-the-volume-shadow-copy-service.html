<h1>Using the Volume Shadow Copy Service</h1>
<p>VSS backup and restore operations each use a protocol for the interaction of the systems that use mass storage (writers) and those that back it up (requesters).</p>
<p>Both backup and restore operations are primarily driven by the requester, which controls writer and provider behavior by generating systemwide COM events for the writer to process. Because event-generating methods are asynchronous, writers do have limited control into the requester's state through the asynchronous handlers available to VSS (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vss/nn-vss-ivssasync"><strong>IVssAsync</strong></a>).</p>
<p>This interaction requires basic data structures describing files and groups of files (<a href="vssgloss-c.html"><em>components</em></a>), as well as a metadata model to allow the storage of backup information and to permit writer/requester communication.</p>

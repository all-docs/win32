<h1>Controlling Filter Graphs Using C</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>If you are writing a DirectShow application in C (rather than C++), you must use a vtable pointer to call methods. The following example illustrates how to call the <strong>IUnknown::QueryInterface</strong> method from an application written in C:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>pGraph-&gt;lpVtbl-&gt;QueryInterface(pGraph, &amp;IID_IMediaEvent, (void **)&amp;pEvent);
</code></pre>
<p>The following shows the equivalent call in C++:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>pGraph-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IMediaEvent, (void **)&amp;pEvent);
</code></pre>
<p>In C, COM interfaces are defined as structures. The <strong>lpVtbl</strong> member is a pointer to a table of interface methods (the vtable). All methods take an additional parameter, which is a pointer to the interface.</p>

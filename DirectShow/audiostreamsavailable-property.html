<h1>AudioStreamsAvailable Property</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>

<p>The <code>AudioStreamsAvailable</code> property retrieves the number of audio streams available in the current title.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>[ iStreams = ] MSWebDVD.AudioStreamsAvailable
</code></pre>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>Returns an integer value from 1 through 8 representing the number of audio streams available in the current title.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This property is read-only with no default value. The primary use of multiple audio streams is to provide movie soundtracks in more than one language. Typically, not every title on a disc has all audio streams enabled. For example, the feature movie might have soundtracks in three different languages, but the trailers might have only an English soundtrack. Before a user can select a stream, the application must determine which streams are available within the current title. Note that particular streams are identified by an index from zero through 7.</p>
<p>Discs generally present a menu showing the available soundtracks, enabling the user to select the audio stream to enable.</p>

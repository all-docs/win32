<h1>Scope Filter Sample</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Scope filter is a renderer filter that displays sound data as wave forms.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use this filter, open GraphEdit and render an audio file (or a video file with an audio stream). Disconnect the audio renderer temporarily and insert the Infinite-Pin Tee (<a href="inftee-filter-sample.html">InfTee Filter Sample</a>) sample filter. Reconnect the audio renderer. Then connect the Infinite-Pin Tee filter's second output pin to the Scope filter. Now run the graph.</p>
<p>The Scope window is implemented as a dialog box, not as an actual window. Developers creating control panels to alter filter parameters in real time might want to use a technique like this rather than property pages.</p>
<p>The Scope filter demonstrates setting up a separate thread to process data. In this case, the data is just copied to a separate buffer on the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imeminputpin-receive"><strong>IMemInputPin::Receive</strong></a> method, and is then drawn on the Scope window on the separate thread.</p>
<p>The Scope filter also enables you to monitor audio output to determine if you are clipping, so you can adjust the gain.</p>
<p>This filter appears in GraphEdit as &quot;Oscilloscope.&quot;</p>

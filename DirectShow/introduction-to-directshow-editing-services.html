<h1>Introduction to DirectShow Editing Services</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.]</p>
<p>The core of DirectShow is a powerful architecture for handling streaming media. An application can use it to play multimedia content authored in a wide variety of formats, without the developer needing to worry about file compression and other tedious details. Prior to <a href="directshow-editing-services.html">DirectShow Editing Services</a> (DES), however, DirectShow lacked the flexibility needed for nonlinear editing.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you wanted to create a video sequence consisting of 4 seconds from source A, followed by 10 seconds from source B, and ending with 5 seconds from source C. You could accomplish that much fairly easily using only the core DirectShow API.</p>
<p>But what if you decided that source C should come before source B, not after; that the sequence should use 8 seconds from source A, not 4; and that the entire production needed a separate audio track playing in the background? Even minor changes such as these could be difficult to implement. But the scenario just described is a trivial editing project in DESâ€”you can do it with a handful of method calls.</p>
<p>Here are some of the features that DES brings to DirectShow:</p>
<ul>
<li>A timeline model that organizes video and audio tracks into nested layers, making it easy to manipulate the final production</li>
<li>The ability to preview a video project on the fly</li>
<li>Project persistence through an XML-based format</li>
<li>Support for video and audio effects, as well as transitions between video tracks (such as fades and wipes)</li>
<li>Over 100 standard wipes, as defined by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE)</li>
<li>Keying based on hue, luminance, RGB value, or alpha value</li>
<li>Automatic conversion of frame rates and audio sampling rates, enabling a production to use heterogeneous sources</li>
<li>Resizing or cropping of video</li>
</ul>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>DES does not support MPEG-2 or H.264 video sources.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Calculating Parameter Values</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Potentially, an input buffer could be very large. Ideally, when the DMO processes the buffer, the parameters will exactly follow their curves throughout the entire batch of data. However, a DMO has some leeway in how it calculates those values.</p>
<ul>
<li>The most accurate approach is to calculate the exact value for every atomic unit of data; for example, each audio sample. This approach is the most computationally expensive.</li>
<li>Another approach is to slice the data into smaller units of some fixed size, such as 100 samples. This approach creates a &quot;stair-stepping&quot; effect. For some parameters, that might be acceptable. In audio effects, it might create audible artifacts.</li>
<li>A compromise is to use the previous technique, but within each batch, perform a linear interpolation of the parameter value for each sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues are especially important for audio processing. One second of audio might contain 48,000 audio samples per channel, which is a lot of calculations to perform, yet the ear is sensitive to artifacts such as aliasing.</p>

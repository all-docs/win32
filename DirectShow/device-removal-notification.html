<h1>Device Removal Notification</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>If the user removes a Plug and Play device that the graph was using, the filter graph manager posts an <a href="ec-device-lost.html"><strong>EC_DEVICE_LOST</strong></a> event. If the device becomes available again, the filter graph manager posts another <strong>EC_DEVICE_LOST</strong> event. However, the previous state of the capture filter is no longer valid. The application must rebuild the graph to use the device.</p>
<p>DirectShow does not send any event when a new device is plugged in. To learn when a new device is available, the application can monitor WM_DEVICECHANGE window messages. For more information, see &quot;Device Management&quot; in the Platform SDK documentation.</p>

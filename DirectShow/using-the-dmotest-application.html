<h1>Using the DMOTest Application</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>

The DMOTest application is no longer available in the SDK.</p>

<p>The DMOTest utility can help verify that a DMO meets the DMO specifications. If you develop a DMO, you should include the DMO test application as part of your testing.</p>
<p>DMOTest is installed in the Bin\DXUtils directory, under the SDK root directory. To use DMOTest, you must first generate some test data for the DMO. The SDK includes a DirectShow filter for this purpose. Details about the filter and the DMOTest application can be found in the DMOTest application Help. In the application, choose <strong>Contents</strong> from the <strong>Help</strong> menu. The Help includes step-by-step instructions for generating test data and running tests.</p>

<h1>Source and Target Rectangles in Video Renderers</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>There are three sizes found in the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/amvideo/ns-amvideo-videoinfo"><strong>VIDEOINFO</strong></a>, <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/amvideo/ns-amvideo-videoinfoheader"><strong>VIDEOINFOHEADER</strong></a>, and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/dvdmedia/ns-dvdmedia-videoinfoheader2"><strong>VIDEOINFOHEADER2</strong></a> format structures of video media types. This article explains what they are and how they work.</p>
<p>First, there is a size in the <strong>bmiHeader</strong> member of these structures. The <strong>bmiHeader</strong> member is a <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-bitmapinfoheader"><strong>BITMAPINFOHEADER</strong></a> structure with its own width and height members, <strong>bmiHeader.biWidth</strong> and <strong>bmiHeader.biHeight</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, there is a rectangle in the <strong>rcSource</strong> member of these structures; and last, there is a rectangle in the <strong>rcTarget</strong> member of these structures.</p>
<p>Assume you have two filters, A and B, and that these filters are connected to each other (A on the left, or upstream, and B on the right, or downstream) with a certain video media type.</p>
<p>The buffers that pass between filters A and B have the size (<strong>bmiHeader.biWidth</strong>, <strong>bmiHeader.biHeight</strong>). Filter A should take a portion of its input video determined by <strong>rcSource</strong> and stretch that video to fill the <strong>rcTarget</strong> portion of the buffer. The portion of the input video to use is based on how <strong>rcSource</strong> compares to the (<strong>biWidth</strong>, <strong>biHeight</strong>) size of the media type that filters A and B originally connected with. If <strong>rcSource</strong> is empty, filter A uses its entire input video. If <strong>rcTarget</strong> is empty, filter A fills the entire output buffer.</p>
<p>For example, assume filter A is receiving video data that is 160 x 120 pixels. Assume also that filter A is connected to filter B with the following media type.</p>
<ul>
<li>(<strong>biWidth</strong>, <strong>biHeight</strong>): 320, 240</li>
<li><strong>rcSource</strong>: (0, 0, 0, 0)</li>
<li><strong>rcTarget</strong>: (0, 0, 0, 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that filter A will stretch the video it receives by 2 in both the x and y directions, and fill a 320 x 240 output buffer.</p>
<p>As another example, assume filter A is receiving 160 x 120 video data, and that it is connected to filter B with the following media type.</p>
<ul>
<li>(<strong>biWidth</strong>, <strong>biHeight</strong>): 320, 240</li>
<li><strong>rcSource</strong>: (0, 0, 160, 240)</li>
<li><strong>rcTarget</strong>: (0, 0, 0, 0)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>rcSource</strong> member is relative to the connected buffer size of 320, 240. Because the specified <strong>rcSource</strong> (0, 0, 160, 240) is the left half of the buffer, filter A will take the left half of its input video, or the (0, 0, 80, 120) portion, and stretch the video to a size of (320, 240) (by 4 in the x direction, and by 2 in the y direction) and filling the 320 x 240 output buffer.</p>
<p>Now assume that filter A calls <a href="cbaseallocator-getbuffer.html"><strong>CBaseAllocator::GetBuffer</strong></a>, and the media sample returned has a media type attached to it, signifying that filter B wants filter A to provide a different size or kind of video than it has previously been providing. Assume the new media type is:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<strong>biWidth</strong>, <strong>biHeight</strong>): 640, 480</li>
<li><strong>rcSource</strong>: (0, 0, 160, 120)</li>
<li><strong>rcTarget</strong>: (0, 0, 80, 60)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the media sample has a buffer that is 640 x 480 in size. The <strong>rcSource</strong> member is relative to the original connected media type (320, 240) not to the new media type of (640, 480), so <strong>rcSource</strong> specifies that the top-left corner (25%) of the input video is to be used. This portion of the input video is placed in the top-left (80, 60) pixels of the 640 x 480 output buffer, as specified by <strong>rcTarget</strong> of (0, 0, 80, 60). Because filter A is receiving 160 x 120 video, the top-left corner of the input video is an (80, 60) piece, the same size of the output bitmap, and no stretching is required.</p>
<p>Filter A will place no data in the other pixels of the output buffer, and will leave those bits untouched. The <strong>rcSource</strong> member is bounded by the <strong>biWidth</strong> and <strong>biHeight</strong> of the original connected media type between filters A and B, and <strong>rcTarget</strong> is bounded by the new <strong>biWidth</strong> and <strong>biHeight</strong> of the media sample. In the preceding example, <strong>rcSource</strong> could not go outside the boundaries of (0, 0, 320, 240) and <strong>rcTarget</strong> could not go outside the boundaries of (0, 0, 640, 480).</p>

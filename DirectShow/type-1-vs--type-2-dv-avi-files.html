<h1>Type-1 vs. Type-2 DV AVI Files</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>DV cameras produce interleaved audio-video; each frame of video also contains the audio information. If you save DV data to an AVI file, you have a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the interleaved data as one stream in the AVI file. This is known as a type-1 file.</li>
<li>Split the interleaved data into separate audio and video streams. This is known as a type-2 file.</li>
</ul>
<p>For video capture, where maximum throughput is crucial, it is better to use a type-1 file, because type-2 files carry redundant audio data. (The video stream still has the audio data. The audio is simply hidden by labeling the stream as video.) Also, writing a type-2 file requires some additional processor time to split the interleaved stream.</p>
<p>On the other hand, type-1 files are less efficient for real-time editing. The application must extract the audio from the interleaved stream, make the edits, and interleave the data again. Also, the type-1 format is not compatible with MicrosoftÂ® Video for WindowsÂ® (VFW). DirectShow can handle both types of files.</p>
<p>A type-2 file can be converted to type-1 using the <a href="dv-muxer-filter.html">DV Muxer</a> filter. A type-1 file can be converted to type-2 using the <a href="dv-splitter-filter.html">DV Splitter</a> filter. The following diagram illustrates the difference between the two formats.</p>

<h1>Tape Location Search</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Although DV devices support a command to search by time code or by absolute track number (ATN), the MSDV driver does not have a standard, device-independent way to access these functions. The only option is to send a raw AV/C command to the driver as described in the topic <a href="issuing-raw-av-c-commands.html">Issuing Raw AV/C Commands</a>.</p>
<p>The UVC driver supports a property set for tape location searches. To send a search command, use the <strong>IKsControl</strong> interface and set the PROPSETID_EXT_TRANSPORT property. Using a property set is safer than sending raw AV/C commands to the device, because AV/C commands bypass the filter and go directly to the device driver.</p>

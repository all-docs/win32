<h1>Transmit DV from File to Tape</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Transmit from DV AVI file to VTR tape is complicated somewhat by the fact that files can type-1 or type-2. To transmit a DV file to tape, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an instance of the <a href="msdv-driver.html">MSDV Driver</a> filter. For more information, see <a href="selecting-a-capture-device.html">Selecting a Capture Device</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure the device is in VTR mode. Otherwise, you cannot transmit to tape.See <a href="device-mode.html">Device Mode</a>.</li>
<li>Initialize the Capture Graph Builder, as described in <a href="about-the-capture-graph-builder.html">About the Capture Graph Builder</a>.</li>
<li>Build the graph. The graph configuration depends on the DV file type:
<ul>
<li><a href="transmit-from-type-1-file.html">Transmit from Type-1 File</a></li>
<li><a href="transmit-from-type-2-file.html">Transmit from Type-2 File</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Put the device into record-pause mode, as described in <a href="controlling-a-dv-camcorder.html">Controlling a DV Camcorder</a>.</li>
<li>Pause the filter graph. While the filter graph is paused, it sends a continuous stream that repeats the first frame of video.</li>
<li>To start transmitting, put the device into record mode and then run the filter graph. It takes the device a certain amount of time until the recording head is able to record, so wait for about two seconds before running the graph. This might result in a few duplicated frames at the beginning of the tape, but it ensures that no data is lost.</li>
</ol>

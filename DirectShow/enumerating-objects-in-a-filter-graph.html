<h1>Enumerating Objects in a Filter Graph</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>An application might need to locate a particular filter in the filter graph, or even a particular pin on a filter. For example, it might use an interface that a particular filter exposes. Or, it might construct a specialized filter graph and need to call methods on individual pins to connect the filters. For this purpose, DirectShow provides several methods for enumerating objects in a filter graph.</p>
<p>The enumerators discussed in this section follow the standard form used by COM enumeration interfaces. For more information, see the &quot;IEnumXXXX&quot; topic in the Platform SDK. For information on enumerating filters that are registered on the user's computer, but aren't yet in the filter graph, see <a href="enumerating-devices-and-filters.html">Enumerating Devices and Filters</a>.</p>

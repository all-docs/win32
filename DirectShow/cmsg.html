<h1>CMsg class</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The <a href="cmsgthread.html"><strong>CMsgThread</strong></a> class provides support for a worker thread to which requests can be posted asynchronously instead of sent directly. The <a href="camthread.html"><strong>CAMThread</strong></a> class provides a worker thread to which single requests can be sent. Only one client can make a request at a time, and the client blocks until the worker thread has completed the request. By contrast, the <strong>CMsgThread</strong> class provides a worker thread to which any number of requests can be posted. The requests (in the form of a <code>CMsg</code> object) are queued and executed in order, asynchronously. No reply or return value is received.</p>

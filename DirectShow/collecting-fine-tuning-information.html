<h1>Collecting Fine-Tuning Information</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Although cable frequencies are generally expected to be exact, broadcast frequencies may be adjusted up or down several kHz by the broadcast station to reduce potential interference with neighboring channels.</p>
<p>When the TV Tuner filter tunes to a channel, it scans for the most precise signal. To save this information in the registry for subsequent tuning operations, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtuner-channelminmax"><strong>IAMTuner::ChannelMinMax</strong></a> to determine the range of frequency entries in the current frequency table.</li>
<li>Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtuner-put_channel"><strong>IAMTuner::put_Channel</strong></a> method once for each frequency index in the range.</li>
<li>Call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtvtuner-storeautotune"><strong>IAMTVTuner::StoreAutoTune</strong></a> to save the fine-tuning information in the registry. The information is stored under the registry key for the current tuning space.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following code shows these steps:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>long lMin = 0, lMax = 0;
hr = pTuner-&gt;ChannelMinMax(&amp;lMin, &amp;lMax);
if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
{
    for (long i = lMin; i &lt;= lMax; i++)
    {
        pTuner-&gt;put_Channel(i, AMTUNER_SUBCHAN_DEFAULT,
            AMTUNER_SUBCHAN_DEFAULT)
    }
    pTuner-&gt;StoreAutoTune();
}
</code></pre>
<p>With earlier versions of the TV Tuner filter, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtvtuner-autotune"><strong>IAMTVTuner::AutoTune</strong></a> method was recommended for fine-tuning. However, this method ignores any frequency overrides, so its use is no longer recommended. The following code is equivalent to the <strong>AutoTune</strong> method, but works correctly with frequency overrides:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT MyAutoTune(IAMTVTuner *pTuner, long lIndex, long *plFoundSignal)
{
    long SignalStrength = AMTUNER_NOSIGNAL;
    HRESULT hr;
    hr = pTuner-&gt;put_Channel(lIndex, AMTUNER_SUBCHAN_DEFAULT, AMTUNER_SUBCHAN_DEFAULT);
    if (NOERROR == hr)
        pTuner-&gt;SignalPresent(&amp;SignalStrength);
    *plFoundSignal = (SignalStrength != AMTUNER_NOSIGNAL);
        return hr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>With broadcast reception, it is not always possible to get a horizontal lock, although the picture is viewable. In these cases, the tuner hardware will have a frequency lock, but the decoder will not have horizontal lock. This condition can be detected when using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtuner-put_channel"><strong>put_Channel</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtvtuner-autotune"><strong>AutoTune</strong></a> by examining the return code.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>S_OK</td>
<td>The tune operation succeeded and the tuner got a frequency lock.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>S_FALSE</td>
<td>There were no errors during the tune operation, but the tuner was not able to get a frequency lock. It is highly unlikely that there is a viewable channel resulting from this operation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Any other return code indicates that some error occurred.</p>
<p>A return value of S_OK does not guarantee that the decoder has a horizontal lock. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtvtuner-autotune"><strong>AutoTune</strong></a> method updates the <em>FoundSignal</em> parameter to indicate whether or not horizontal lock was achieved. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtuner-signalpresent"><strong>IAMTuner::SignalPresent</strong></a> method returns the same information.</p>
<p>When the return value is S_OK, however, the application has the option of ignoring the <em>FoundSignal</em> parameter, because the tuner is reporting a frequency lock. There is the possibility of a frequency lock on noise, but this possibility should be weighed against the possibility of skipping viewable channels.</p>
<h2>Registry Conversion</h2>
<p>To support frequency overrides, the internal format of the registry key that holds fine-tuning information has changed. The original format is still supported for backward compatibility, but it does not support frequency overrides.</p>
<p>The old registry format is converted to the new format whenever the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iamtvtuner-storeautotune"><strong>IAMTVTuner::StoreAutoTune</strong></a> method is called. If your application adds frequency overrides, it should call the <strong>StoreAutoTune</strong> method to convert to the new registry format. It is not necessary to collect any fine-tuning information before calling <strong>StoreAutoTune</strong>.</p>

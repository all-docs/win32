<h1>Subobjects</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.]</p>
<p>Sources, effects, and transitions have internal pointers to other COM objects, called <em>subobjects</em>. The subobject performs the actual work of the object. The subobject of a source is the component that creates the video or audio data. The subobject of an effect or transition is the component that transforms the data; for example, in a video effect, it creates the visual effect in the video stream.</p>
<p>The type of subobject depends on the type of object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source: Any DirectShow source filter or parser filter that supports seeking and produces a format that DES supports. It can be a compressed format if DirectShow filters exist to decode it.</li>
<li>Effect: For video, any 2-D one-input MicrosoftÂ® DirectXÂ® Transform object. For audio, any DirectShow audio effect filter.</li>
<li>Transition: For video, any 2-D two-input DirectX Transform object. Audio does not support transitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Groups, compositions, and tracks do not have subobjects.</p>
<p>The application does not directly set the subobject pointer. For effects and transitions, the application calls the <a href="iamtimelineobj-setsubobjectguid.html"><strong>IAMTimelineObj::SetSubObjectGUID</strong></a> method to specify the GUID of the subobject. For source objects, an application typically calls the <a href="iamtimelinesrc-setmedianame.html"><strong>IAMTimelineSrc::SetMediaName</strong></a> to specify the name of a source file. However, the <strong>SetSubObjectGUID</strong> method can also be used for source objects, to specify the class identifier (CLSID) of a filter.</p>

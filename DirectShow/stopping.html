<h1>Stopping</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The <strong>Stop</strong> method must unblock the <strong>Receive</strong> method and decommit the filter's allocators. Decommitting an allocator forces any pending <strong>GetBuffer</strong> calls to return, which unblocks upstream filters that are waiting for samples. The <strong>Stop</strong> method holds the filter lock and then calls the <a href="cbasefilter-stop.html"><strong>CBaseFilter::Stop</strong></a> method, which calls <a href="cbasepin-inactive.html"><strong>CBasePin::Inactive</strong></a> on all of the filter's pins:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT CMyFilter::Stop()
{
    CAutoLock lock_it(m_pLock);
    // Inactivate all the pins, to protect the filter resources.
    hr = CBaseFilter::Stop();

    /* Safe to destroy filter resources used by the streaming thread. */

    return hr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Override the input pin's <strong>Inactive</strong> method as follows:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT CMyInputPin::Inactive()
{
    // You do not need to hold the filter lock here. 
    // It is already locked in Stop.

    // Unblock Receive.
    SetEvent(m_hSomeEventThatReceiveNeedsToWaitOn);

    // Make sure Receive will fail. 
    // This also decommits the allocator.
    HRESULT hr = CBaseInputPin::Inactive();

    // Make sure Receive has completed, and is not using resources.
    {
        CAutoLock c(&amp;m_csReceive);

        /* It is now safe to destroy filter resources used by the
           streaming thread. */
    }
    return hr;
}
</code></pre>

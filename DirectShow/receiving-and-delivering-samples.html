<h1>Receiving and Delivering Samples</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The following pseudocode shows how to implement the <strong>IMemInput::Receive</strong> method:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT CMyInputPin::Receive(IMediaSample *pSample)
{
    CAutoLock cObjectLock(&amp;m_csReceive);

    // Perhaps the filter needs to wait on something.
    WaitForSingleObject(m_hSomeEventThatReceiveNeedsToWaitOn, INFINITE);

    // Before using resources, make sure it is safe to proceed. Do not
    // continue if the base-class method returns anything besides S_OK.
    hr = CBaseInputPin::Receive(pSample);
    if (hr != S_OK) 
    {
        return hr;
    }

    /* It is safe to use resources allocated in Active and Pause. */

    // Deliver sample(s), via your output pin(s).
    for (each output pin)
        pOutputPin-&gt;Deliver(pSample);

    return hr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>Receive</strong> method holds the streaming lock, not the filter lock. The filter might need to wait on some event before it can process the data, shown here by the call to <strong>WaitForSingleObject</strong>. Not every filter will need to do this. The <a href="cbaseinputpin-receive.html"><strong>CBaseInputPin::Receive</strong></a> method verifies some general streaming conditions. It returns VFW_E_WRONG_STATE if the filter is stopped, S_FALSE if the filter is flushing, and so forth. Any return code other than S_OK indicates that the <strong>Receive</strong> method should return immediately and not process the sample.</p>
<p>After the sample is processed, deliver it to the downstream filter by calling <a href="cbaseoutputpin-deliver.html"><strong>CBaseOutputPin::Deliver</strong></a>. This helper method calls <strong>IMemInputPin::Receive</strong> on the downstream input pin. A filter might deliver samples to several pins.</p>

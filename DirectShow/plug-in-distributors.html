<h1>Plug-in Distributors</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Plug-in distributors (PIDs) are a way to extend the functionality of the filter graph manager. A plug-in distributor is a COM object that the filter graph manager aggregates at run time. Applications obtain access to the PID through the filter graph manager.</p>
<p>When the filter graph manager is queried for an interface that it does not support, it searches the registry for a key with the following form:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface\IID\Distributor
</code></pre>
<p><code>IID</code> is a string containing the interface identifier. If the registry entry exists, the value of the entry defines the class identifier (CLSID) of a PID that supports the interface. The filter graph manager aggregates the PID and returns an interface pointer, thereby acting as the outer <strong>IUnknown</strong> for the PID. When the application calls methods on the interface, it is actually calling them on the PID. However, the existence of the PID is transparent to the application.</p>
<p>The term <em>distributor</em> stems from the fact that a PID can query its outer <strong>IUnknown</strong> pointer for interfaces on the filter graph manager. By calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ifiltergraph-enumfilters"><strong>IFilterGraph::EnumFilters</strong></a> method, the PID can enumerate the filters in the graph and distribute method calls to those filters. In this way, a PID can serve as a single control point for the application to call methods on filters.</p>
<p>When the filter graph manager aggregates a PID, it queries the PID for the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-idistributornotify"><strong>IDistributorNotify</strong></a> interface. If the PID supports this interface, the filter graph manager uses it to notify the PID about changes in the graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the filter graph switches between run, paused, and stopped states, it calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-idistributornotify-run"><strong>IDistributorNotify::Run</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-idistributornotify-pause"><strong>IDistributorNotify::Pause</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-idistributornotify-stop"><strong>IDistributorNotify::Stop</strong></a>.</li>
<li>When a reference clock is set, the filter graph manager calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-idistributornotify-setsyncsource"><strong>IDistributorNotify::SetSyncSource</strong></a>.</li>
<li>When filters are added or removed, or pin connections are changed, the filter graph manager calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-idistributornotify-notifygraphchange"><strong>IDistributorNotify::NotifyGraphChange</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To implement a custom PID, create a COM object that supports aggregation. It must support an interface that the filter graph manager does not already support. Optionally, it can support the <strong>IDistributorNotify</strong> interface.</p>
<p>If the PID obtains any interface pointers from the filter graph manager, it should release them immediately. Otherwise, it might create a circular reference count, which could prevent the filter graph manager from being destroyed. Holding a reference count on the filter graph manager is unnecessary in any case, because the filter graph manager controls the PID's lifetime.</p>
<p>Because a PID is designed specifically for aggregation by the filter graph manager, you might want to enforce this in the PID's constructor method. Check whether the outer <strong>IUnknown</strong> pointer is <strong>NULL</strong>, and if so, return the error code VFW_E_NEED_OWNER. (See <a href="error-and-success-codes.html">Error and Success Codes</a>.) Also, to prevent other objects from aggregating the PID, you can query the outer <strong>IUnknown</strong> pointer for the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-igraphbuilder"><strong>IGraphBuilder</strong></a> interface. Return an error code if the object does not expose <strong>IGraphBuilder</strong>.</p>

<h1>Composition and Layering</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.]</p>
<p>In a collection of tracks, the first track has the lowest priority (priority 0) and each subsequent track has a priority one level higher. At each priority level, the source clips in that track hide the source clips in the tracks below it, unless that layer also contains a transition. Thus you can imagine DES making several passes when it renders.</p>
<p>First, it renders track 0. There is nothing &quot;under&quot; Track 0, so empty regions are rendered as a solid black image. Transitions in this layer occur between the black image and track 0 or vice versa. DES lays track 1 on top of track 0, generating any transitions between the two tracks. The result is the composite of the two tracks. Next, it places track 2 onto this composite. Transitions at this layer occur between the composite and track 2. The process continues until the last (highest-priority) track is put down.</p>
<p>When several tracks are composited together, they behave like a single track (called a virtual track). The composition object encapsulates this behavior, making complex transitions possible. For example, one video clip can wipe to a second clip, while the composite (both clips plus the wipe) fades to a third clip.</p>

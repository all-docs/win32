<h1>Creating Multimedia Stream Objects and Stream Samples</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
These APIs are deprecated. Applications should use the <a href="sample-grabber-filter.html"><strong>Sample Grabber</strong></a> filter or implement a custom filter to get data from a DirectShow filter graph.</p>

<p>Objects that support the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mmstream/nn-mmstream-imultimediastream"><strong>IMultiMediaStream</strong></a> interface are the basic containers for multimedia data streams. The <strong>IMultiMediaStream</strong> interface includes methods that enumerate the object's data streams; these streams are typically video and audio data, but can include data of any format, such as closed-captioning, plain text, or SMPTE timecode. The <strong>IMultiMediaStream</strong> interface is a generic container, however; developers can create other versions of the interface that support specific data formats. Objects that implement the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/amstream/nn-amstream-iammultimediastream"><strong>IAMMultiMediaStream</strong></a> interface, for example, can enumerate and control streams of any DirectShow data format. Because individual data streams are format specific, they support at least two different interfaces: one generic and one data-specific. Every stream supports the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mmstream/nn-mmstream-imediastream"><strong>IMediaStream</strong></a> interface, which provides methods to retrieve its format and a pointer to the stream itself. The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/ddstream/nn-ddstream-idirectdrawmediastream"><strong>IDirectDrawMediaStream</strong></a> interface, on the other hand, has methods that deal specifically with rendering video data. Any interface derived from <strong>IMultiMediaStream</strong> also supports the creation of stream samples, the basic units of streaming data.</p>
<p>A multimedia sample is a reference to an object containing the media data. For a video image, this is a DirectDraw surface. The sample's exact content varies, depending on the type of media (sound, text, and so on). Because a sample is only a reference to the data object, any number of stream samples can refer to the same object. The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mmstream/nn-mmstream-istreamsample"><strong>IStreamSample</strong></a> interface provides methods that get and set a sample's characteristics, such as its start and stop time, status, and stream association. The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/mmstream/nf-mmstream-istreamsample-update"><strong>IStreamSample::Update</strong></a> method refreshes the sample's data in the case of readable streams. For writable streams, it will write the sample's data to the stream. Typically, you use the <strong>Update</strong> method in a loop that renders, transfers, or stores streaming data.</p>

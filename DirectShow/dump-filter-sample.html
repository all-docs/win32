<h1>Dump Filter Sample</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Dump Filter is a renderer filter that writes the media samples it receives to a text file.</p>
<p>This sample illustrates how to use the base filter class <a href="cbasefilter.html"><strong>CBaseFilter</strong></a> and the rendered input pin class <a href="crenderedinputpin.html"><strong>CRenderedInputPin</strong></a>. It also demonstrates how to implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ifilesinkfilter"><strong>IFileSinkFilter</strong></a> interface. The Dump filter has a single input pin, which writes every sample that it receives directly to a file.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This filter is a useful debugging tool. For example, you can verify, bit by bit, the results of a transform filter. You can build a graph manually by using GraphEdit, and connect the Dump filter to the output of a transform filter or any other output pin. You can also connect a tee filter and put the Dump filter on one leg of the tee filter and the typical output on another leg to monitor the results in a real-time scenario.</p>
<h2>Downloading the Sample</h2>
<p>To download the DirectShow SDK samples, install the latest version of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/bb980924.aspx">Windows SDK</a>.</p>
<p>This sample is installed under the following path: <em>[SDK Root]</em>\Samples\Multimedia\DirectShow\Filters\Dump.</p>

<h1>Subsequent DVD Region Change</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>In Windows 2000 and later, the DVD Navigator invokes a property page on the DVD-ROM drive device in the Device Manager. This property page is also brought up by the DVDPlay.exe application when a region needs to be changed. The UI of this property page is very similar to that of DVDRgn.exe and it is regionalized in the operating system.</p>
<p>For RPC1 drives, the Windows Operating System components manage region changes. RPC2 drives maintain the region setting in their own hardware. When the number of allowed changes are exhausted on a RPC2 drive, the drive will fail the call to change the region and the region-change component in the operating system will indicate that to the user.</p>

<h1>Clock Times</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>DirectShow defines two related clock times: reference time and stream time.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reference time</em> is the absolute time returned by the reference clock. (See <a href="reference-clocks.html">Reference Clocks</a>.)</li>
<li><em>Stream time</em> is defined relative to when the graph last started running.
<ul>
<li>While the graph is running, stream time equals reference time minus start time.</li>
<li>While the graph is paused, stream time remains at the stream time when it was paused.</li>
<li>After a seek operation, stream time resets to zero.</li>
<li>While the graph is stopped, stream time is undefined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When a media sample has a time stamp <em>t</em>, it means the sample should be rendered at stream time <em>t</em>. For this reason, stream time is also called <em>presentation time</em>.</p>
<p>When an application calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Control/nf-control-imediacontrol-run"><strong>IMediaControl::Run</strong></a> to run the filter graph, the Filter Graph Manager calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-imediafilter-run"><strong>IMediaFilter::Run</strong></a> on each filter. To compensate for the slight amount of time it takes for the filters to start running, the Filter Graph Manager specifies a start time slightly in the future.</p>

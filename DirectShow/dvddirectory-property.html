<h1>DVDDirectory Property</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>

<p>The <code>DVDDirectory</code> property sets or retrieves the current directory of the current DVD volume.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>[ sDirPath = ] MSWebDVD.DVDDirectory
</code></pre>
<h2>Return Value</h2>
<p>Returns a string value indicating the path to the DVD root directory.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This property is read/write with no default value. Use this method to set the root path when there is more than one DVD drive on a system. When there is only one drive on the system and its drive letter is higher than &quot;C&quot;, the MSWebDVD object finds it automatically. For a standard DVD-Video disc, the root path should include the ts_video directory:</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>MSWebDVD.DVDDirectory = &quot;e:\\video_ts&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Some DVD volumes may have their video in a directory named something other than &quot;video_ts.&quot; The general idea is that an additional &quot;DVD volume&quot; (the set of .IFO. VOB, and .BUP files that would normally be stored in the VIDEO_TS directory) can be placed in a subdirectory on the disc. By changing the root to point to this directory, MSWebDVD will operate on this separate DVD volume. A new set of menus, titles, and so on will be available, independent of the titles in the VIDEO_TS root, which will no longer be accessible. Such directories are called &quot;hidden directories.&quot; The following example shows how to set a hidden directory as the root, where &quot;hidden&quot; is a placeholder for whatever name the disc authors have given to the directory.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>MSWebDVD.DVDDirectory = &quot;d:\\webdvd\\hidden&quot;
</code></pre>

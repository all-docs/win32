<h1>Quality Messages</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Quality messages are defined with the <a href="/windows/win32/api/strmif/ns-strmif-quality"><strong>Quality</strong></a> structure. This structure contains the following members:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Defined by the <a href="/windows/win32/api/strmif/ne-strmif-qualitymessagetype"><strong>QualityMessageType</strong></a> enumeration; either Famine, indicating that the filter is receiving too little data, or Flood, indicating that the filter is receiving too much data.</li>
<li><strong>Proportion:</strong> The requested adjustment in the data rate, from a baseline of 1000. For example, 750 indicates 75% and 1500 indicates 150%.</li>
<li><strong>Late:</strong> Reference time indicating how late the most recent sample arrived. The value is negative if the sample arrived early.</li>
<li><strong>TimeStamp:</strong> The time stamp on the most recent sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, suppose that a sample with a time stamp of 240 milliseconds (ms) reaches the renderer at 280 ms, stream time. The renderer creates a quality message of type Famine. The sample arrived 40 ms late, so the <strong>Late</strong> member is 400000. (All reference times are in 100-nanosecond units.) The <strong>TimeStamp</strong> member is 2400000.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Proportion</strong> member, the renderer might use a running average to calculate the value. Perhaps samples have been arriving on time, and this sample is an anomaly. In that case the renderer might request only a small correction. On the other hand, if samples are consistently late, the renderer might request a larger correction.</p>
<p>Quality control is handled through the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-iqualitycontrol"><strong>IQualityControl</strong></a> interface. It contains two methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iqualitycontrol-notify"><strong>Notify</strong></a>: Sends a quality message.</li>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-iqualitycontrol-setsink"><strong>SetSink</strong></a>: Specifies a custom quality manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>An object that implements <strong>IQualityControl</strong> receives quality messages through its <strong>Notify</strong> method. It can either handle the message or pass the message to another object. If the application calls the object's <strong>SetSink</strong> method, the object should delegate quality control to the specified quality manager.</p>

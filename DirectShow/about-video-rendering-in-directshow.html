<h1>About Video Rendering in DirectShow</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>DirectShow provides several filters that render video:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="video-renderer-filter.html">Video Renderer</a> filter. This filter is available for all platforms that support DirectX, and has no particular system requirements. The Video Renderer uses DirectDraw whenever possible to render the video; otherwise, it uses GDI. This filter is the default video renderer on platforms earlier than Windows XP.</li>
<li><a href="video-mixing-renderer-filter-7.html">Video Mixing Renderer Filter 7</a> (VMR-7). The VMR-7 is available on Windows XP, where it is the default video renderer. The VMR-7 always uses DirectDraw 7 for rendering. It provides many powerful features not available in the older Video Renderer filter, including a plug-in model where the application controls the DirectDraw surfaces used for rendering.</li>
<li><a href="video-mixing-renderer-filter-9.html">Video Mixing Renderer Filter 9</a> (VMR-9). The VMR-9 is a newer version of the Video Mixing Renderer that uses Direct3D 9 for rendering. It is available for all platforms that support DirectX. It is not the default renderer, however, because it has higher system requirements than the Video Renderer filter.</li>
<li>The <a href="overlay-mixer-filter.html">Overlay Mixer</a> filter is designed specifically for DVD playback and broadcast video. It also supports Video Port Extensions (VPEs), enabling it to work with hardware MPEG-2 decoders or analog TV tuners that send video directly to the graphics card.</li>
<li>The <a href="enhanced-video-renderer-filter.html"><strong>Enhanced Video Renderer</strong></a> (EVR) filter is available starting in Windows Vista. It offers improved video performance compared with earlier video renderers, especially when Windows Vista desktop composition is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the EVR is preferred for applications that target Windows Vista or later, and the VMR-9 is preferred for applications running on earlier versions of Windows. For more information about using the VMR-7 and VMR-9 filters, see <a href="using-the-video-mixing-renderer.html">Using the Video Mixing Renderer</a>.</p>
<p>Windowed Mode and Windowless Mode</p>
<p>A DirectShow video renderer can operate in either <em>windowed</em> mode or <em>windowless</em> mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>In windowed mode, the renderer creates its own window to display the video. Typically you will make this window the child of an application window. For more information, see <a href="using-windowed-mode.html">Using Windowed Mode</a>.</li>
<li>In windowless mode, the renderer draws the video directly onto an application window. It does not create its own window. For more information about this mode, see <a href="using-windowless-mode.html">Using Windowless Mode</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Video Renderer filter supports windowed mode only. The VMR-7 and VMR-9 filters support both modes. They default to windowed mode for backward compatibility, but windowless mode is preferred. The EVR supports windowless mode only.</p>

<h1>FOURCCMap class</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>

<p>The <strong>FOURCCMap</strong> class provides conversion between <strong>GUID</strong> media subtypes and old-style <strong>FOURCC</strong> 32-bit media tags. In the original Windows multimedia APIs, media types were tagged with 32-bit values created from four 8-bit characters and were known as <strong>FOURCC</strong>s. DirectShow media types have <strong>GUID</strong>s for the subtype, partly because these are simpler to create (creation of a new <strong>FOURCC</strong> requires its registration with Microsoft). Because <strong>FOURCC</strong>s are unique, a one-to-one mapping has been made possible by allocating a range of 4,000 million <strong>GUID</strong>s representing <strong>FOURCC</strong>s. This range is all <strong>GUID</strong>s of the form:</p>
<p><code>XXXXXXXX-0000-0010-8000-00AA00389B71</code></p>
<p>This class simplifies conversion between <strong>GUID</strong>s and <strong>FOURCC</strong>s. This is for compatibility only. It is recommended that all new media subtypes be represented by <strong>GUID</strong>s created by Guidgen.exe or a similar tool, and not by mapping <strong>FOURCC</strong>s.</p>
<p>The object is derived from a <strong>GUID</strong>, with no extra data members, and can be cast to a <strong>GUID</strong>. The object can be passed a <strong>FOURCC</strong> at construction time. The default constructor will initialize the <strong>FOURCC</strong> to zero.</p>
<p>The <a href="fourccmap-getfourcc.html"><strong>GetFOURCC</strong></a> and <a href="fourccmap-setfourcc.html"><strong>SetFOURCC</strong></a> methods do not check that the fixed portions of the <strong>GUID</strong> correspond to the <strong>FOURCC</strong> range. Thus, if you cast a pointer to a <strong>GUID</strong> into a pointer to a <strong>FOURCC</strong> and then set or get the <strong>FOURCC</strong> field, you also need to check separately that the <strong>GUID</strong> is within the <strong>FOURCC</strong> range.</p>

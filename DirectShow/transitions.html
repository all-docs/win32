<h1>Transitions</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.]</p>
<p>A transition is a way to segue from one video track to another, using a visual effect such as a fade or a wipe. The following illustration shows a timeline with a transition:</p>
<p><img src="images/timeline3.png" alt="timeline with transition" /></p>
<p>The transition object is on track 1, and it represents a transition from track 0 to track 1. At the start of the transition, the rendered video is entirely from Track 0 (source A). At the end, the video is entirely from Track 1 (source C). In between, the output transitions from source A to source C. For example, in a fade transition, one source progressively fades to the other. The final output is schematized along the bottom of the illustration.</p>
<p>Transitions cannot overlap in time within the same track, but you can create overlapping transitions by using the composition object, as described in <a href="composition-and-layering.html">Composition and Layering</a>.</p>
<p>A transition has a direction. By default, it starts from the lower priority track (source A, in the previous example.) and ends at the higher-priority track (source C). In between, the video is a mixture of the two sources. However, you can specify the opposite behavior, as shown in the following illustration:</p>
<p><img src="images/fade.png" alt="ntrack with two transitions" /></p>
<p>Here, the first transition fades from track 0 fades track 1, which is the default behavior. The second transition fades from track 1 back to Track 0. Note that both transitions are located on track 1.</p>

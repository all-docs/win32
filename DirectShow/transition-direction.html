<h1>Transition Direction</h1>
<p>[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.]</p>
<p>A transition goes from input A to input B, and from time tâ‚€ to tâ‚. Therefore, the <em>direction</em> of a transition can mean one of two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mapping of timeline layers to inputs.</li>
<li>The progression over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is the <em>input direction</em>, and the second is the <em>progress direction</em>. You can control both directions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Input direction: By default, a transition goes from the composite of the lower-priority layers to the layer that contains the transition. To reverse this direction, call the <a href="iamtimelinetrans-setswapinputs.html"><strong>IAMTimelineTrans::SetSwapInputs</strong></a> method.</li>
<li>Progress direction: Most transitions support a standard <strong>Progress</strong> property, which specifies what percentage of the transition is reflected in the output at a given moment. By default, the value of the <strong>Progress</strong> property goes from 0.0 to 1.0 over the duration of the transition. To reverse the progress, set the <strong>Progress</strong> property to go from 1.0 to 0.0.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the difference between input direction and progress direction. It shows four variations on a standard <a href="smpte-wipe-transition.html">SMPTE Wipe</a> transition.</p>
<p><img src="images/wipedirections.png" alt="wipe directions" /></p>
<p>The transition resides on track 1. By default, the wipe goes from left to right and from track 0 to track 1. Swapping inputs causes the wipe to go from track 1 to track 0, but still from left to right. Reversing the progress makes the transition go from right to left. You can combine both, as shown on the far left.</p>

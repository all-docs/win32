<h1>Class Factories and Factory Templates</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>This topic describes how to implement a DLL for a DirectShow filter, using the <a href="directshow-base-classes.html">DirectShow Base Classes</a>.</p>
<p>Before a client creates an instance of a COM object, it creates an instance of the object's class factory, using a call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cogetclassobject"><strong>CoGetClassObject</strong></a> function. The client then calls the class factory's <strong>IClassFactory::CreateInstance</strong> method. It is the class factory that actually creates the component and returns a pointer to the requested interface. (The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance"><strong>CoCreateInstance</strong></a> function combines these steps, inside the function call.)</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the sequence of method calls.</p>
<p><img src="images/classfactory.png" alt="method calls to create a class factory" /></p>
<p><a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cogetclassobject"><strong>CoGetClassObject</strong></a> calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-dllgetclassobject"><strong>DllGetClassObject</strong></a> function, which is defined in the DLL. This function creates the class factory and returns a pointer to an interface on the class factory. DirectShow implements <strong>DllGetClassObject</strong> for you, but the function relies on your code in a specific way. To understand how it works, you must understand how DirectShow implements class factories.</p>
<p>A class factory is a COM object dedicated to creating another COM object. Each class factory has one type of object that it creates. In DirectShow, every class factory is an instance of the same C++ class, <strong>CClassFactory</strong>. Class factories are specialized by means of another class, <a href="cfactorytemplate.html"><strong>CFactoryTemplate</strong></a>, also called the <em>factory template</em>. Each class factory holds a pointer to a factory template. The factory template contains information about a specific component, such as the component's class identifier (CLSID), and a pointer to a function that creates the component.</p>
<p>The DLL declares a global array of factory templates, one for each component in the DLL. When <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-dllgetclassobject"><strong>DllGetClassObject</strong></a> makes a new class factory, it searches the array for a template with a matching CLSID. Assuming it finds one, it creates a class factory that holds a pointer to the matching template. When the client calls <strong>IClassFactory::CreateInstance</strong>, the class factory calls the instantiation function defined in the template.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the sequence of method calls.</p>
<p><img src="images/classfactory2.png" alt="class factory templates in a dll" /></p>
<p>The benefit of this architecture is that you can define just a few things that are specific to your component, such as the instantiation function, without implementing the entire class factory.</p>

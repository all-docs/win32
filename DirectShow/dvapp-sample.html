<h1>DVApp Sample</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Digital Video (DV) capture application.</p>
<p>This sample demonstrates how to build various types of filter graphs for controlling DV camcorders. It also shows how to perform capture, preview, transmit, and device control with a DV camcorder.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The DVApp application supports the following modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preview: Renders DV from the camcorder to a video window.</li>
<li>DV to type-1 file: Captures DV data from the camcorder to a type-1 DV file.</li>
<li>Type-1 file to DV: Transmits data from a type-1 DV file to the camcorder.</li>
<li>DV to type-2 file: Captures DV data from the camcorder to a type-2 DV file.</li>
<li>Type-2 file to DV: Transmits data from a type-2 DV file to the camcorder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The capture and transmit modes also perform preview. Each of those modes has a <strong>No Preview</strong> option as well, which disables preview. Capturing without preview is more efficient and can reduce the number of dropped frames.</p>
<p>The application starts in preview mode. To select another mode, choose a mode from the <strong>Graph Mode</strong> menu. For each mode, DVApp builds a filter graph that supports the functionality of that mode. To save the graph as a GraphEdit (.grf) file, select <strong>Save Graph to File</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu. Quit DVApp before opening the file in GraphEdit.</p>
<p>To capture to a file:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, choose <strong>Set Output File</strong> and enter a file name.</li>
<li>From the <strong>Graph Mode</strong> menu, select a <em>DV to File</em> mode (type 1 or type 2, with or without preview).</li>
<li>Click <strong>Record</strong>.</li>
<li>If the camcorder is in VTR mode, click <strong>Play</strong>.</li>
<li>To stop capturing, click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To transmit from a file to the camcorder:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <strong>File</strong> menu, click <strong>Set Input File</strong> and select a DV file. The file must match the selected mode (type 1 or type 2).</li>
<li>From the <strong>Graph Mode</strong> menu, select a <em>File to DV</em> mode (type 1 or type 2, with or without preview).</li>
<li>Click <strong>Play</strong>.</li>
<li>To record the data to tape, click <strong>Record</strong>.</li>
<li>To stop transmitting, click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the camcorder is in VTR mode, the user can control the transport mechanism through the application's VCR-style buttons. To seek the tape, enter the target timecode and click the seek button.</p>
<p>To limit how much data the application captures, choose <strong>Capture Size</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>
<p>To check the tape format (NTSC or PAL), choose <strong>Check Tape</strong> from the <strong>Options</strong> menu.</p>
<p>To change the size of the preview window, choose <strong>Change Decode Size</strong> from the <strong>Options</strong> menu.</p>
<h3>Programming Notes</h3>
<p>The main purpose of this application is to show how to build various DV capture and transmit graphs.</p>
<h3>Device Arrival and Removal</h3>
<p>The application handles device arrival and removal, using two different techniques. For device arrival, the application's message loop responds to WM_DEVICECHANGE messages. For device removal, the application responds to <a href="ec-device-lost.html"><strong>EC_DEVICE_LOST</strong></a> events from the filter graph manager. Either approach works, although the EC_DEVICE_LOST event depends on the existence of the device in the filter graph.</p>
<p>The application only handles one device at a time. If the current device is removed, the application looks for another DV device on the system.</p>
<p>On some DV camcorders, the user must shut off the device when switching it between camera mode and VTR mode, which triggers a device-lost message. The application responds by enabling or disabling the appropriate menu commands. However, if the user toggles rapidly between modes, the camcorder might not generate a device-lost message. You can force the menus to update by choosing <strong>Refresh Mode</strong> from the <strong>Options</strong> menu. Some DV camcorders can toggle modes without shutting off, but send a device-lost message only when they switch to VTR mode.</p>
<h3>Device Control</h3>
<p>The functionality of the <strong>Play</strong> and <strong>Record</strong> button depends on the current mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preview: The filter graph runs automatically. The <strong>Play</strong> button starts the transport.</li>
<li>Capture to file: The <strong>Record</strong> button runs the graph, and the <strong>Play</strong> button starts the transport.</li>
<li>Transmit to device: The <strong>Play</strong> button runs the graph, and the <strong>Record</strong> button starts the transport.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sample application does not perform frame-accurate capture. At various points, the application calls the <strong>Sleep</strong> function to wait for the device to respond. Newer DV camcorders send a notification when the state of the device changes. Older devices might not support notification; for the purposes of a sample, calling <strong>Sleep</strong> is a simpler solution.</p>

<h1>Unicable Frequency Table</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Due to its length, the Unicable table is not included here. The goal behind the Unicable table is to include a comprehensive set of frequencies (basically all other tables combined, plus some real-world observations) in one table to facilitate an automated channel scan without resorting to a linear search of the entire frequency spectrum. For those frequencies that are not included in this table, the consumer will be required to enter a frequency through a custom user interface, resulting in a frequency override entry in the registry.</p>

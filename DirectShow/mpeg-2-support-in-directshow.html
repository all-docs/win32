<h1>MPEG-2 Support in DirectShow</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>This section describes the components that you can use to play MPEG-2 content in DirectShow.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
Although DVD video is based on MPEG-2, this section does not describe DVD playback or navigation. For information about DVD in DirectShow, see <a href="dvd-applications.html">DVD Applications</a>.</p>

<p>MPEG-2 data can come from a local file, or from a live source, such as a network broadcast or D-VHS device. File playback is called <em>pull mode</em> because the parser filter pulls data from the file into the filter graph. Live sources are called <em>push mode</em> because the source filter pushes data into the graph.</p>
<p>DirectShow provides two filters that can parse MPEG-2 system streams:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mpeg-2-demultiplexer.html">MPEG-2 Demultiplexer</a> (&quot;demux&quot;): This filter supports push mode for program streams and transport streams. In Windows XP and later, it also supports pull mode for program streams.</li>
<li><a href="mpeg-2-splitter.html">MPEG-2 Splitter</a>: This filter supports pull mode for program streams on downlevel platforms. This filter is deprecated in Windows XP and later.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use the MPEG-2 demux or MPEG-2 splitter, you must have DirectShow-compatible MPEG-2 audio and video decoders that accept packetized elementary streams (PES).</p>

<h1>Working with Effects and Transitions</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.]</p>
<p>Effects modify a single clip, track, or composition. Transitions create seques from one track or compositionsto another.</p>
<p><a href="directshow-editing-services.html">DirectShow Editing Services</a> uses DirectX Transform objects for its video transitions and video effects. For video transitions, use any 2-D two-input DirectX Transform object. For video effects, use any 2-D one-input DirectX Transform object. Microsoft no longer supports the development of third-party DirectX Transform objects. However, several are provided with DirectShow and others are provided with Microsoft Internet Explorer. For more information about the transitions provided with Internet Explorer, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms532853(v=vs.85)">Visual Filters and Transitions Reference</a>.</p>
<p>For audio effects, you can use any DirectShow audio effect filter. DES also provides a <a href="volume-envelope-effect.html">Volume Envelope Effect</a> for setting the volume on a track or clip. DES does not support audio transitions.</p>

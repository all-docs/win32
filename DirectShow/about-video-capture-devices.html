<h1>About Video Capture Devices</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Most new video capture devices use Windows Driver Model (WDM) drivers. In the WDM architecture, Microsoft supplies a set of hardware-independent drivers, called class drivers, and the hardware vendor provides hardware-specific minidrivers. A minidriver implements any functions that are specific to the device; for most functions, the minidriver calls the Microsoft class driver.</p>
<p>In a DirectShow filter graph, any WDM capture device appears as the <a href="wdm-video-capture-filter.html">WDM Video Capture</a> filter. The WDM Video Capture filter configures itself based on the characteristics of the driver. It appears under a name provided by the driver â€” you will not see a filter called &quot;WDM Video Capture Filter&quot; anywhere in the graph.</p>
<p>Some older capture devices still use Video for Windows (VFW) drivers. Although these drivers are now obsolete, they are supported in DirectShow through the <a href="vfw-capture-filter.html">VFW Capture</a> filter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Windows allows users to grant or deny access to the device's camera in the Windows Settings app, under <strong>Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Camera</strong>. When initializing the capture device, apps should check whether they have access to the camera and handle the case where access is denied by the user. For more information, see <a href="/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/camera-privacy-setting">Handle the Windows camera privacy setting</a>.</p>

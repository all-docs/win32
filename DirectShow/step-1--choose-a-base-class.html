<h1>Step 1. Choose a Base Class</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>This is step 1 of the tutorial <a href="writing-transform-filters.html">Writing Transform Filters</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming that you decide to write a filter and not a DMO, the first step is choosing which base class to use. The following classes are appropriate for transform filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="ctransformfilter.html"><strong>CTransformFilter</strong></a> is designed for transform filters that use separate input and output buffers. This kind of filter is sometimes called a copy-transform filter. When a copy-transform filter receives an input sample, it writes new data to an output sample and delivers the output sample to the next filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="ctransinplacefilter.html"><strong>CTransInPlaceFilter</strong></a> is designed for filters that modify data in the original buffer, also called trans-in-place filters. When a trans-in-place filter receives a sample, it changes the data inside that sample and delivers the same sample downstream. The filter's input pin and output pin always connect with matching media types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="cvideotransformfilter.html"><strong>CVideoTransformFilter</strong></a> is designed primarily for video decoders. It derives from <strong>CTransformFilter</strong>, but includes functionality for dropping frames if the downstream renderer falls behind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="cbasefilter.html"><strong>CBaseFilter</strong></a> is a generic filter class. The other classes in this list all derive from <strong>CBaseFilter</strong>. If none of them is suitable, you can fall back on this class. However, this class also requires the most work on your part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>![Important]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In-place video transforms can have a serious impact on rendering performance. In-place transforms require read-modify-write operations on the buffer. If the memory resides on a graphics card, read operations are significantly slower. Moreover, even a copy transform can cause unintended read operations if you do not implement it carefully. Therefore, you should always do performance testing if you write a video transform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the example RLE encoder, the best choice is either <strong>CTransformFilter</strong> or <strong>CVideoTransformFilter</strong>. In fact, the differences between them are largely internal, so it is easy to convert from one to the other. Because the media types must be different on the two pins, the <strong>CTransInPlaceFilter</strong> class is not appropriate for this filter. This example will use <strong>CTransformFilter</strong>.</p>

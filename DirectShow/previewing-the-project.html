<h1>Previewing the Project</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>[This API is not supported and may be altered or unavailable in the future.]</p>
<p>To preview the project, you need a component called a <em>render engine</em>, which builds a DirectShow filter graph from a timeline. The filter graph is what actually renders the project. You can use the render engine to preview a project or to write the final output file.</p>
<p>This article does not go into detail about the render engine. For preview, you only need a few method calls. You can find a more thorough discussion, including how to write output files, in <a href="rendering-a-project.html">Rendering a Project</a>. The following code example shows how to construct a preview graph.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>IRenderEngine *pRender = NULL; 
hr = CoCreateInstance(CLSID_RenderEngine, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER,
            IID_IRenderEngine, (void**) &amp;pRender);

hr = pRender-&gt;SetTimelineObject(pTL);
hr = pRender-&gt;ConnectFrontEnd( );
hr = pRender-&gt;RenderOutputPins( );
</code></pre>
<p>Create the render engine using the <strong>CoCreateInstance</strong> function. Then call the following methods on the render engine's <a href="irenderengine.html"><strong>IRenderEngine</strong></a> interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="irenderengine-settimelineobject.html"><strong>SetTimelineObject</strong></a>. Specifies the timeline to use.</li>
<li><a href="irenderengine-connectfrontend.html"><strong>ConnectFrontEnd</strong></a>. Builds a partial filter graph, with one output pin for each group in the timeline.</li>
<li><a href="irenderengine-renderoutputpins.html"><strong>RenderOutputPins</strong></a>. Completes the preview graph by connecting each output pin to a video or audio renderer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the graph is built, you can preview the project by running the graph, as you would with any DirectShow filter graph. First, obtain a pointer to the filter graph by calling the <a href="irenderengine-getfiltergraph.html"><strong>IRenderEngine::GetFilterGraph</strong></a> method.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>IGraphBuilder   *pGraph = NULL;
hr = pRender-&gt;GetFilterGraph(&amp;pGraph);
</code></pre>
<p>Query the filter graph for the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Control/nn-control-imediacontrol"><strong>IMediaControl</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Control/nn-control-imediaevent"><strong>IMediaEvent</strong></a> interfaces. Use these two interfaces to run the graph and wait for playback to complete. For an explanation of how to use these interfaces, see <a href="how-to-play-a-file.html">How To Play a File</a> and <a href="responding-to-events.html">Responding to Events</a>. The following code shows one way to use these interfaces.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>IMediaControl   *pControl = NULL;
IMediaEvent     *pEvent = NULL;
long evCode;
pGraph-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IMediaControl, (void **)&amp;pControl);
pGraph-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IMediaEvent, (void **)&amp;pEvent);
hr = pControl-&gt;Run();
hr = pEvent-&gt;WaitForCompletion(INFINITE, &amp;evCode);
pControl-&gt;Stop();
</code></pre>
<p>The code in this example blocks program execution until playback completes, because of the INFINITE parameter in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Control/nf-control-imediaevent-waitforcompletion"><strong>IMediaEvent::WaitForCompletion</strong></a> method call. If something goes wrong during playback, however, it could cause the program to stop responding. In a real application, use a message loop to wait for playback to complete. It's also recommended that you provide the user with a way to interrupt playback.</p>
<p>When you finish using the render engine, always call the <a href="irenderengine-scrapit.html"><strong>IRenderEngine::ScrapIt</strong></a> method. This method deletes the filter graph and releases any resources held by the render engine.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>pRender-&gt;ScrapIt();
</code></pre>

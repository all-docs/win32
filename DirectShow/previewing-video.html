<h1>Previewing Video (DirectShow)</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>To build a video preview graph, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2-renderstream"><strong>ICaptureGraphBuilder2::RenderStream</strong></a> method as follows:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>ICaptureGraphBuilder2 *pBuild; // Capture Graph Builder
// Initialize pBuild (not shown).

IBaseFilter *pCap; // Video capture filter.

/* Initialize pCap and add it to the filter graph (not shown). */

hr = pBuild-&gt;RenderStream(&amp;PIN_CATEGORY_PREVIEW, &amp;MEDIATYPE_Video, 
    pCap, NULL, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>This example assumes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>pBuild</em> was initialized, as described in <a href="about-the-capture-graph-builder.html">About the Capture Graph Builder</a>.</li>
<li><em>pCap</em> was initialized, by creating an instance of the capture filter and adding it to the filter graph, as described in <a href="selecting-a-capture-device.html">Selecting a Capture Device</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first parameter to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2-renderstream"><strong>ICaptureGraphBuilder2::RenderStream</strong></a> method specifies a pin category; for a preview graph, use <strong>PIN_CATEGORY_PREVIEW</strong>. The second parameter specifies a media type, as a major type GUID. For video, use <strong>MEDIATYPE_Video</strong>. DV devices deliver interleaved audio and video, for which the media type is <strong>MEDIATYPE_Interleaved</strong>. (For more information about DV capture, see <a href="digital-video-in-directshow.html">Digital Video in DirectShow</a>.)</p>
<p>The third parameter is a pointer to the capture filter's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-ibasefilter"><strong>IBaseFilter</strong></a> interface. The next two parameters are not needed in this example. They are used to specify additional filters that might be needed to render the stream. Setting the last parameter to <strong>NULL</strong> causes the Capture Graph Builder to select a default renderer for the stream, based on the media type. For video, the Capture Graph Builder always uses the <a href="video-renderer-filter.html">Video Renderer</a> filter as the default renderer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
In Windows XP and later, although the Video Mixing Renderer (VMR) is the default video renderer for <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nn-strmif-igraphbuilder"><strong>IGraphBuilder</strong></a> methods, it is not the default renderer for the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2-renderstream"><strong>RenderStream</strong></a> method. On any platform, the Capture Graph Builder always uses the old Video Renderer filter unless you specify otherwise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Although the pin category is given as <strong>PIN_CATEGORY_PREVIEW</strong>, it does not matter whether the filter actually has a preview pin; it could have a video port pin or just a capture pin. In either case, the Capture Graph Builder automatically builds the correct graph.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the simplest possible graph for previewing video.</p>
<p><img src="images/vidcap01.png" alt="video preview graph" /></p>
<p>In this diagram, the capture filter has a preview pin, which connects directly to the video renderer.</p>
<p>If the capture filter has only a capture pin, the Capture Graph Builder inserts a <a href="smart-tee-filter.html">Smart Tee</a> filter, which splits the stream into a capture stream and a preview stream. This is described in more detail in <a href="combining-video-capture-and-preview.html">Combining Video Capture and Preview</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, the video stream must go through the Overlay Mixer filter. If so, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-icapturegraphbuilder2-renderstream"><strong>RenderStream</strong></a> method adds it to the graph automatically.</p>

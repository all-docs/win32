<h1>Using the Video Mixing Renderer</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>In terms of both performance and breadth of features, the Video Mixing Renderer (VMR) filter represents the next generation in video rendering on the Windows platform. The VMR replaces the <a href="overlay-mixer-filter.html">Overlay Mixer</a> and <a href="video-renderer-filter.html">Video Renderer</a>, and adds many new mixing features.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the VMR:</p>
<ul>
<li>The VMR-7, which uses DirectDraw 7 for rendering.</li>
<li>The VMR-9, which uses Direct3D 9.</li>
</ul>
<p>The VMR-7 is available on Windows XP and later, but is not available for redistribution. The VMR-9 is available for redistribution on all platforms supported by DirectX 9. The two VMR filters are very similar in their implementation and the interfaces that they expose.</p>
<p>The VMR-9 has its own CLSID and its own set of interfaces, structures and enumeration types which are not always identical to the corresponding data types for the VMR-7, due to the underlying differences between DirectDraw 7 and Direct3D 9. The VMR-9 interfaces all end with &quot;9&quot;, for example <strong>IVMRStreamConfig9</strong>, and the structures and enumeration types all have &quot;VMR9&quot; in their name to distinguish them from the data types used with the VMR-7.</p>
<p>To ensure backward-compatibility, the VMR-9 is not the default renderer on any system. To use the VMR-9, you must explicitly add it to the filter graph using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Strmif/nf-strmif-ifiltergraph-addfilter"><strong>IFilterGraph::AddFilter</strong></a> method, and configure it before connecting it to any upstream filters.</p>
<p>This article contains the following sections. Except where noted, the information in these sections applies to both the VMR-7 and the VMR-9 filters.</p>

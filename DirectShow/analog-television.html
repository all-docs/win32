<h1>Analog Television</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Analog television differs from other video capture scenarios in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tuner card tunes to an analog signal, which is then digitized.</li>
<li>Audio is carried in the analog signal. How the audio reaches the sound card varies depending on the hardware.</li>
<li>The signal may contain additional data in the vertical blanking interval (VBI), such as closed captions (CC), World Standard Teletext (WST), and extended data services (XDS).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows a typical filter graph for television preview.</p>
<p><img src="images/vidcap06.png" alt="analog television graph" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="tv-tuner-filter.html">TV Tuner</a> filter controls tuning.</li>
<li>The <a href="tv-audio-filter.html">TV Audio</a> filter controls the audio decoding.</li>
<li>If the tuner card has more than one physical input, the <a href="analog-video-crossbar-filter.html">Analog Video Crossbar</a> filter enables the application to select which input is decoded and rendered.</li>
<li>The <a href="wdm-video-capture-filter.html">WDM Video Capture</a> filter delivers the digitized video stream.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Capture Graph Builder automatically inserts any filters that are required upstream from the capture filter.</p>

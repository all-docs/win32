<h1>How IUnknown Works</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/directshow/directshow">DirectShow</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine">IMFMediaEngine</a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation">Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</a>. Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong>, <strong>IMFMediaEngine</strong> and <strong>Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation</strong> instead of <strong>DirectShow</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The methods in <strong>IUnknown</strong> enable an application to query for interfaces on the component and manage the component's reference count.</p>
<p><strong>Reference Count</strong></p>
<p>The reference count is an internal variable, incremented in the <strong>AddRef</strong> method and decremented in the <strong>Release</strong> method. The base classes manage the reference count and synchronize access to the reference count among multiple threads.</p>
<p><strong>Interface Queries</strong></p>
<p>Querying for an interface is also straightforward. The caller passes two parameters: an interface identifier (IID), and the address of a pointer. If the component supports the requested interface, it sets the pointer to the interface, increments its own reference count, and returns S_OK. Otherwise, it sets the pointer to <strong>NULL</strong> and returns E_NOINTERFACE. The following pseudocode shows the general outline of the <strong>QueryInterface</strong> method. Component aggregation, described in the next section, introduces some additional complexity.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>if (IID == IID_IUnknown)
    set pointer to (IUnknown *)this
    AddRef
    return S_OK

else if (IID == IID_ISomeInterface)
    set pointer to (ISomeInterface *)this
    AddRef
    return S_OK

else if ... 

else
    set pointer to NULL
    return E_NOINTERFACE
</code></pre>
<p>The only difference between the <strong>QueryInterface</strong> method of one component and the <strong>QueryInterface</strong> method of another is the list of IIDs that each component tests. For every interface that the component supports, the component must test for the IID of that interface.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregation and Delegation</strong></p>
<p>Component aggregation must be transparent to the caller. Therefore, the aggregate must expose a single <strong>IUnknown</strong> interface, with the aggregated component deferring to the outer component's implementation. Otherwise, the caller would see two different <strong>IUnknown</strong> interfaces in the same aggregate. If the component is not aggregated, it uses its own implementation.</p>
<p>To support this behavior, the component must add a level of indirection. A <em>delegating IUnknown</em> delegates the work to the appropriate place: to the outer component, if there is one, or to the component's internal version. A <em>nondelegating IUnknown</em> does the work, as described in the previous section.</p>
<p>The delegating version is public and keeps the name <strong>IUnknown</strong>. The nondelegating version is renamed <a href="inondelegatingunknown.html"><strong>INonDelegatingUnknown</strong></a>. This name is not part of the COM specification, because it is not a public interface.</p>
<p>When the client creates an instance of the component, it calls the <strong>IClassFactory::CreateInstance</strong> method. One parameter is a pointer to the aggregating component's <strong>IUnknown</strong> interface, or <strong>NULL</strong> if the new instance is not aggregated. The component uses this parameter to store a member variable indicating which <strong>IUnknown</strong> interface to use, as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>CMyComponent::CMyComponent(IUnknown *pOuterUnkown)
{
    if (pOuterUnknown == NULL)
        m_pUnknown = (IUnknown *)(INonDelegatingUnknown *)this;
    else
        m_pUnknown = pOuterUnknown;

    [ ... more constructor code ... ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each method in the delegating <strong>IUnknown</strong> calls its nondelegating counterpart, as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT QueryInterface(REFIID iid, void **ppv) 
{
    return m_pUnknown-&gt;QueryInterface(iid, ppv);
}
</code></pre>
<p>By the nature of delegation, the delegating methods look identical in every component. Only the nondelegating versions change.</p>

<h1>EAP Implementation Details</h1>
<p>Access Points (APs), such as Remote Access Service (RAS), interact with EAP implementations through the use of function calls that must be exported by the third-party EAP DLL. In other words, EAP is a provider API, meaning that plug-ins or DLLs implement code to become an EAP provider, but must not call the EAP APIs themselves. For example, a programmer of an EAP DLL creates code for an EAP initialization routine and places this code in the EAP predefined function <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa363527(v=vs.85)"><strong>RasEapInitialize</strong></a>. Then at run-time, the AP connection manager calls the <strong>RasEapInitialize</strong> function, which contains the code, to initialize the EAP implementation.</p>

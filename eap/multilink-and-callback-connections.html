<h1>Multilink and Callback Connections</h1>
<p>For the first link in a multilink connection, the authentication service sets the RAS_EAP_FLAG_FIRST_LINK flag in the <strong>fFlags</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Raseapif/ns-raseapif-ppp_eap_input"><strong>PPP_EAP_INPUT</strong></a> structure. The authentication protocol can use the presence of this flag to determine whether to present a user interface specifically for the first link of a multilink connection.</p>
<p>If the connection is configured so that the server calls back the client computer, the RAS_EAP_FLAG_FIRST_LINK flag will not be set on the callback.</p>
<p>If the authentication protocol sets the <strong>fSaveConnectionData</strong> member of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Raseapif/ns-raseapif-ppp_eap_output"><strong>PPP_EAP_OUTPUT</strong></a> to <strong>TRUE</strong>, subsequent links in the multilink connection receive the new connection-specific data. In the case of user-specific data, however, the authentication protocol continues to get the original user-specific data even if it sets the <strong>fSaveUserData</strong> member of <strong>PPP_EAP_OUTPUT</strong> to <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<p>The authentication protocol may use an <a href="interactive-user-interface.html">interactive user interface</a> to collect data for a particular link of a multilink connection. In this case, the authentication service makes the resulting data available to the authentication protocol during subsequent links. However, this data is never saved to persistent storage.</p>

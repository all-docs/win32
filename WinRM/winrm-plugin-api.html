<h1>WinRM Plug-in API</h1>
<p>Windows Remote Management plug-ins are native dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that plug into and extend the functionality of WinRM. The WinRM Plug-in application programming interface (API) provides functionality that enables a user to write plug-ins by implementing certain APIs for supported <a href="windows-remote-management-glossary.html"><em>resource URIs</em></a> and operations. After the plug-ins are configured for either the WinRM service or Internet Information Services (IIS), they are loaded into the WinRM host or IIS host, respectively. Remote requests are routed to these plug-in entry points to carry out operations.</p>
<p>The WinRM Plug-in API reference section contains detailed information about the following API elements:</p>

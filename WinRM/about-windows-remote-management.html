<h1>About Windows Remote Management</h1>
<p>Windows Remote Management is one component of the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc785056(v=ws.10)">Windows Hardware Management</a> features that manage server hardware locally and remotely. These features include a service that implements the <a href="windows-remote-management-glossary.html"><em>WS-Management</em></a> protocol, hardware diagnosis and control through baseboard management controllers (<a href="windows-remote-management-glossary.html"><em>BMCs</em></a>), and a COM API and <a href="winrm-scripting-api.html">scripting objects</a> that allow you to write applications that communicate remotely through the WS-Management protocol. For more information about the public specification for WS-Management protocol, see <a href="https://dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0226_1.2.0.pdf">Web Services for Management (WSâ€“Management)</a>.</p>
<h2>Components of WinRM and Hardware Management</h2>
<p>The following is a list of components and features that are supplied by WinRM and hardware monitoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="winrm-scripting-api.html">WinRM Scripting API</a></p>
<p>This scripting API enables you to obtain data from remote computers using scripts that perform WS-Management protocol operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Winrm.cmd</strong></p>
<p>This commandâ€“line tool for system management is implemented in a Visual Basic Scripting Edition file (Winrm.vbs) written using the WinRM scripting API. This tool enables an administrator to configure WinRM and to get data or manage resources. For more information, see the online help provided by the command line <strong>Winrm</strong> <strong>/?</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Winrs.exe</strong></p>
<p>This command line tool enables administrators to remotely execute most Cmd.exe commands using the WS-Management protocol. For more information, see the online help provided by the command line <strong>Winrs</strong> <strong>/?</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) driver and WMI provider</p>
<p>Hardware management through the <a href="windows-remote-management-glossary.html"><em>Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)</em></a> provider and driver enables you to control and diagnose remote server hardware through BMCs when the operating system is not running or deployed.</p>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ipmiprv/ipmi-provider">IPMI Provider</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WMI service</p>
<p>The WMI service continues to run side-by-side with WinRM and provides requested data or control through the <a href="windows-remote-management-glossary.html"><em>WMI plug-in</em></a>. You can continue to obtain data from standard WMI classes, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-process"><strong>Win32_Process</strong></a>, as well as IPMI-supplied data. For more information about configuration and installation required for WinRM, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc785056(v=ws.10)">Hardware Management Introduction</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WS-Management protocol</p>
<p>WS-Management protocol, a SOAP-based, firewall-friendly protocol, was designed for systems to locate and exchange management information. The intent of the WS-Management protocol specification is to provide interoperability and consistency for enterprise systems that have computers running on a variety of operating systems from different vendors.</p>
<p>WS-Management protocol is based on the following standard web service specifications: HTTPS, SOAP over HTTP (WS-I profile), SOAP 1.2, WS-Addressing, WS-Transfer, WS-Enumeration, and WS-Eventing. For more information about the current draft of the specification, see the <a href="/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/ms951267(v=msdn.10)">Management Specifications Index Page</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Working with WinRM</h2>
<p>For more information about writing WinRM scripts, see <a href="using-windows-remote-management.html">Using Windows Remote Management</a>.</p>
<p>The following table lists topics that provide information about the WS-Management protocol, WinRM and WMI, how to specify management resources such as disk drives or processes.</p>

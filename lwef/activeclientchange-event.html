<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>When multiple client applications share the same character, the active client of the character receives mouse input (for example, Microsoft Agent control click or drag events). Similarly, when multiple characters are displayed, the active client of the topmost character (also known as the input-active client) receives <a href="command-event.html">Command</a> events.</p>
<p>When the active client of a character changes, this event passes back the ID of that character and <strong>True</strong> if your application has become the active client of the character or <strong>False</strong> if it is no longer the active client of the character.</p>
<p>A client application may receive this event when the user selects a client application's entry in character's pop-up menu or by voice command, when the client application changes its active status, or when another client application quits its connection to Agent. Agent sends this event only to the client applications that are directly affected; that either become the active client or stop being the active client.</p>

<h1>The Office Animation Set</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>The following table lists the animations defined for the Microsoft Office 2000 characters. If you intend to use your character in Microsoft Office, you should support all of the animations in this table. In addition, you can add any other animations you live, but keep in mind that Microsoft Office won't call them. Animations with asterisks (*) should be 100% looping. Other animations should be brief.</p>

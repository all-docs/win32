<h1>Audio Output Support</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>Microsoft Agent enables you to use audio files for a character's spoken output. You can record audio files and use the <a href="speak-method.html"><strong>Speak</strong></a> method to play that data. Microsoft Agent animation services automatically support lip-syncing the character mouth by using the audio characteristics of the audio file. Microsoft Agent also supports a special format for audio files, which includes additional phoneme and word-break information for more enhanced lip-sync support. You can generate this special format using the Microsoft Linguistic Information Sound Editing Tool.</p>

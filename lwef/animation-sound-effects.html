<h1>Animation Sound Effects</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>Microsoft Agent also enables you to include sound effects as a part of a character's animation. Using the Microsoft Agent Character Editor, you can specify the filename of standard Windows sound (.WAV) files to trigger on a given frame. Note that Microsoft Agent does not mix sound effects and spoken output, so spoken output does not begin until a sound effect completes. Therefore, avoid any long or looping sound effect as a part of a character's animation.</p>

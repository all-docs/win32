<h1>Other Speech Engines Compatible with Microsoft Agent</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>In addition to the Microsoft speech engines that are provided with and support Microsoft Agent, a number of companies also offer speech engines with support for Microsoft Agent. This page gives you a brief overview of such engines that may be available in U.S. English and other languages. Information about how to install and access, as well as license and redistribute the engines can be found at their websites.</p>
<p>When using any third-party speech engine, you also need to install Microsoft SAPI 4.0a runtime binaries so that the engines are enumerated properly. From your webpage you can include the following tag to trigger an autodownload of the Speech API:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>&lt;OBJECT WIDTH=0 HEIGHT=0
  CLASSID=&quot;CLSID:0C7F3F20-8BAB-11d2-9432-00C04F8EF48F&quot;
  CODEBASE=&quot;#VERSION=4,0,0,0&quot;&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about the SAPI runtime binaries, refer to the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee705648.aspx">Microsoft Speech group's website</a>. Microsoft Agent also installs the SAPI runtime binaries with the Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine, the Speech Control Panel, and the Agent Character Editor.</p>

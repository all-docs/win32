<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>The engine must call out through <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=**AudioStop**"><strong>AudioStop</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=**AudioStart**"><strong>AudioStart</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=**Visual**"><strong>Visual</strong></a>. The <strong>Visual</strong> callback must provide IPA phonemes. (The International Phonetic Alphabet [IPA] is a universal notation for describing the phonetic content of spoken communication. All speakable phonemes have representations in IPA. Details of IPA are in the Microsoft Speech API specification [part of the Speech SDK 4.0 download] at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee705648.aspx">https://www.microsoft.com/speech/</a>.)</p>
<p>Although the <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=**Visual**"><strong>Visual</strong></a> notification is fairly rich, Microsoft Agent uses only the <strong>cIPAPhoneme</strong> value to animate the mouth as the character speaks. Any Microsoft Agent-compatible engine must provide a closely synchronized stream of <strong>Visual</strong> notifications reflecting the phonetic content of the produced utterance. In this case, &quot;relatively timely notification&quot; is not adequate, because speaker-hearers are fairly sensitive to discrepancies between mouth position and acoustic content. <strong>Visual</strong> notifications need to be returned promptly.</p>

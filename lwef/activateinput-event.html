<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>The input-active client receives mouse and speech input events supplied by the server. The server sends this event only to the client that becomes input-active.</p>
<p>This event can occur when the user switches to your <a href="the-command-object.html">Command</a> object, for example, by choosing your Command object entry in the Commands Window or in the pop-up menu for a character. It can also occur when the user selects a character (by clicking or speaking its name), when a character becomes visible, and when the character of another client application becomes hidden. You can also call the <a href="activate-method.html">Activate Method</a> (with <strong>State</strong> set to 2) to explicitly make the character topmost, which results in your client application becoming input-active and triggers this event. However, this event does not occur if you use the Activate Method method only to specify whether your client is the active client of the character.</p>

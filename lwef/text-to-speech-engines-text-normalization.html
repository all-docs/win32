<h1>Text-to-Speech Engines Text Normalization</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>Normalization is the process of identifying numbers, abbreviations, acronyms and idiomatics and transforming them into full text as needed, usually based on the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>For example, using the L&amp;H TruVoice American English TTS Engine, the sentence:</p>
<p>King George VI of England died on Feb 6, 1952.</p>
<p>will be read under <strong>normal context</strong> as:</p>
<p>Â Â Â King George V I of England, died on February six, nineteen fifty-two.</p>
<p>But under <strong>E-mail context</strong>, it will be read as:</p>
<p>Â Â Â King George the sixth of England, died on February sixth, nineteen fifty-two.</p>
<p>Information about using the <strong>Context</strong> speech tag can be found in the Agent programming documentation <a href="microsoft-agent-speech-output-tags.html">Microsoft Agent Speech Output Tags</a>.</p>

<h1>Animating a Character</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>Once a character is loaded, you can use several of Microsoft Agent's methods for animating the character. The first one you use is typically the <a href="show-method.html"><strong>Show</strong></a> method. <strong>Show</strong> makes the character's frame visible and plays the animation assigned to the character's <strong>Showing</strong> state.</p>
<p>Once the character's frame is visible, you can use the <a href="play-method.html"><strong>Play</strong></a> method, specifying the name of an animation, to play that animation. Animation names are specific to a character definition. As an animation plays, the shape of its window changes to match the image in the frame. This results in a movable graphic image, or <em>sprite</em>, displayed on top of the desktop and all windows, or <em>z-order</em>.</p>
<p>If the character's file is stored locally, you can simply call the <a href="play-method.html"><strong>Play</strong></a> method. In other cases, such as when you have loaded an .ACF character from an HTTP server, you must use the <a href="get-method.html"><strong>Get</strong></a> (or <a href="/windows/desktop/lwef/iagentcharacter--prepare"><strong>Prepare</strong></a>) method to first retrieve the animation data. This will cause Agent to request the animation file from the server and store it in the browser's buffer on the local machine.</p>
<p>The <a href="speak-method.html"><strong>Speak</strong></a> method enables you to program the character to speak, automatically lip-syncing the output. Further details are covered in the Output section of this document.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="moveto-method.html"><strong>MoveTo</strong></a> method to position the character at a new location. When you call the <strong>MoveTo</strong> method, Microsoft Agent automatically plays the appropriate animation based on the character's current location, then moves the character's frame. Similarly, when you call <a href="gestureat-method.html"><strong>GestureAt</strong></a>, Microsoft Agent plays the appropriate gesturing animation based on the character's location and the location specified in the call.</p>
<p>To hide the character, call the <a href="hide-method.html">Hide</a> method. This automatically plays the character associated with the character's <strong>Hiding</strong> state, then hides the character's frame. However, you can also hide or show a character by setting the character's <a href="visible-property.html"><strong>Visible</strong></a> property.</p>
<p>Microsoft Agent processes all animation calls, or <em>requests</em>, asynchronously. This enables your application's code to continue handling other events while the request is being processed. For example, calls to the <a href="play-method.html"><strong>Play</strong></a> method place the animation in a queue for the character so that the animations can be played sequentially. However, this means you cannot assume that a call to other functions will necessarily execute after an animation it follows in your code. For example, typically, a statement following a call to <strong>Play</strong> or <a href="moveto-method.html"><strong>MoveTo</strong></a> will execute before the animation finishes.</p>
<p>You can synchronize your code with animations in a character's queue by creating an object reference to the animation request, and, when the animation starts or completes, monitoring the <a href="the-request-object.html">Request</a> events that the server uses to notify clients of the character. For example, if you want a message box to appear when the character finishes an animation, you can put the message box call in your <a href="requestcomplete-event.html"><strong>RequestComplete</strong></a> event handling subroutine, checking for the particular request ID.</p>
<p>When a character is hidden, the server does not play animations; however, it still queues and processes the animation request (plays the animation) and passes a request status back to the client. In the hidden state, the character cannot become input-active. However, if the user speaks the name of the character (when speech input is enabled), the server automatically shows the character.</p>
<p>When your client application loads multiple characters at the same time, Microsoft Agent's animation services enable you to animate characters independently or use the <a href="wait-method.html"><strong>Wait</strong></a>, <a href="interrupt-method.html"><strong>Interrupt</strong></a>, or <a href="stop-method.html"><strong>Stop</strong></a> methods to synchronize their animation with each other.</p>
<p>Microsoft Agent also plays other animations automatically for you. For example, if the character's state has not changed for several seconds, Agent begins playing animations assigned to the character's <strong>Idling</strong> animations. Similarly, when speech input is enabled, Agent plays the character's <strong>Listening</strong> animations and then <strong>Hearing</strong> animations when an utterance is detected. These server-managed animations are called <em>states</em>, and are defined when a character is created.

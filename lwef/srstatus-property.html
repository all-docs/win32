<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This property returns the conditions necessary to support speech input, including the status of the audio device. You can check this property before you call the <a href="listen-method.html"><strong>Listen</strong></a> method to better ensure its success.</p>
<p>When speech input is enabled in the Agent property sheet (Advanced Character Options), querying this property will load the associated engine, if it is not already loaded, and start speech services. That is, the Listening key is available, and the Listening Tip is automatically displayable. (The Listening key and Listening Tip are only enabled if they are also enabled in Advanced Character Options.) However, if you query the property when speech is disabled, the server does not start speech services.</p>
<p>This property only applies to your client application's use of the character; the setting does not affect other clients of the character or other characters of your client application.</p>

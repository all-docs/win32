<h1>Creating a New Sound File</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>When you first start the editor, you can create a new sound file by choosing <strong>Record</strong> from the <strong>Audio</strong> menu or clicking the <strong>Record</strong> button on the sound editor's toolbar, and then speaking into the microphone attached to your system. Click the <strong>Stop</strong> button on the toolbar to stop recording. You can select the <strong>Play</strong> command from the <strong>Audio</strong> menu or the toolbar to see how Microsoft Agent processes the sound file without linguistic enhancement. To create another new file, select New from the <strong>File</strong> menu or the toolbar.</p>

<h1>Speech Input Events</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>In addition, to the <a href="command-event.html"><strong>Command</strong></a> event notification, Agent also notifies the input-active client when the server turns the Listening mode on or off, using the <a href="listenstart-event.html"><strong>ListenStart</strong></a> and <a href="listencomplete-event.html"><strong>ListenComplete</strong></a> events (<a href="iagentnotifysinkex--listeningstate.html"><strong>IAgentNotifySinkEx::ListeningState</strong></a>). However, if the user presses the Listening mode key and there is no matching speech recognition engine available for the topmost character of the input-active client, the server starts the Listening hotkey mode time-out, but does not generate a <strong>ListenStart</strong> event for the active client of the character. If, before the time-out completes, the user activates another character with speech recognition engine support, the server attempts to activate speech input and generates the <strong>ListenStart</strong> event.</p>
<p>Similarly, if a client attempts to turn on the Listening mode using the <a href="listen-method.html"><strong>Listen</strong></a> method and there is no matching speech recognition engine available, the call fails and the server does not generate a <a href="listenstart-event.html"><strong>ListenStart</strong></a>event. In the Microsoft Agent control, the <strong>Listen</strong> method returns <strong>False</strong>, but the call does not raise an error.</p>
<p>When the Listening key mode is on and the user switches to a character that uses a different speech recognition engine, the server switches to and activates that engine and triggers a <a href="listencomplete-event.html"><strong>ListenComplete</strong></a> and then a <a href="listenstart-event.html"><strong>ListenStart</strong></a> event. If the activated character does not have an available speech recognition engine (because one is not installed or none match the activated character's language ID setting), the server will trigger the <strong>ListenComplete</strong> event for the previously activated character and passes back a value in the <strong>Cause</strong> parameter. However, the server does not generate <strong>ListenStart</strong> or <strong>ListenComplete</strong> events for the clients that do not have speech recognition support.</p>
<p>If a client successfully calls the <a href="listen-method.html"><strong>Listen</strong></a> method and a character without speech recognition engine support becomes input-active before the Listening mode time-out completes, and then the user switches back to the character of the original client, the server will generate a <a href="listenstart-event.html"><strong>ListenStart</strong></a> event for that client.</p>
<p>If the input-active client switches speech recognition engines by changing <a href="srmodeid-property.html"><strong>SRModeID</strong></a> while in Listening mode, the server switches to and activates that engine without re-triggering the <a href="listenstart-event.html"><strong>ListenStart</strong></a> event. However, if the specified engine is not available, the call fails (raises an error in the control) and the server also calls the <a href="listencomplete-event.html"><strong>ListenComplete</strong></a> event.</p>

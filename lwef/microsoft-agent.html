<h1>Microsoft Agent</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows. For more information, see <a href="../win7appqual/windows-7-application-quality-cookbook.html">Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Application Quality Cookbook</a>.]</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Microsoft Agent version 2.0 provides technology to create innovative, new conversational interfaces for applications and webpages. It provides powerful animation capability, interactivity, and versatility, with incredible ease of development.</p>
<p>Microsoft Agent is a technology that provides a foundation for more natural ways for people to communicate with their computers. It is a set of software services that enable developers to incorporate interactive animated characters into their applications and webpages. These characters can speak, via a text-to-speech engine or recorded audio, and even accept spoken voice commands. Microsoft Agent empowers developers to extend the user interface beyond the conventional mouse and keyboard interactions prevalent today.</p>
<p>Enhancing applications and webpages with a visible interactive personality will both broaden and humanize the interaction between users and their computers.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>There are a limitless number of roles and functions that developers can create for these personalities to perform.</p>
<ul>
<li>A welcome host could greet new users and provide a guided tour the first time a computer is turned on, an application is run, or a website is browsed.</li>
<li>A friendly tutor could lead someone through a task or a decision tree with instructions step-by-step along the way.</li>
<li>A messenger could deliver a notification or alert that a new email has arrived and then offer to read it to you.</li>
<li>An assistant could perform tasks for you like looking up information on the Internet and then reading it out loud.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>Microsoft Agent is designed primarily for developers who use languages or environments which support COM or Microsoft ActiveX control interfaces. These include:</p>

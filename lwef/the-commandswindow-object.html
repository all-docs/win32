<h1>The CommandsWindow Object</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/lwef/the-commandswindow-object"><strong>CommandsWindow</strong></a> object provides access to properties of the Voice Commands Window. The Voice Commands Window is a shared resource primarily designed to enable users to view voice-enabled commands. If speech recognition is disabled, the Voice Commands Window still displays, with the text &quot;Speech input disabled&quot; (in the language of the character). If no speech engine is installed that matches the character's language setting the window displays, &quot;Speech input not available.&quot; If the input-active client has not defined voice parameters for its commands and has disabled global voice commands, the window displays, &quot;No voice commands.&quot; You can also query the properties of the Voice Commands Window regardless of whether speech input is disabled or a compatible speech engine is installed.</p>

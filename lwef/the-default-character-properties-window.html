<h1>The Default Character Properties Window</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>In addition to enabling applications to load a specific character, applications can load a character that is a shared resource for the user, known as the <em>default character</em>. The default character is accessible from any application, but the character is only selectable by the user. To facilitate selection of this character, Agent provides a window that provides access to selecting this character, called the default character properties window. Access to this window is supported from the Agent API.</p>

<p>The default character properties window cannot be used to provide character selection other than for the default character.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>This event is sent to all clients when the Listening mode time-out ends, after the user releases the Listening key, when the input active client calls the <a href="listen-method.html"><strong>Listen</strong></a> method with <strong>False</strong>, or the user finished speaking. You can use this event to determine when to resume character spoken (audio) output.</p>
<p>If you turn on Listening mode using the <a href="listen-method.html"><strong>Listen</strong></a> method and then the user presses the Listening key, the Listening mode resets and continues until the Listening key time-out completes, the Listening key is released, or the user finishes speaking, whichever is later. In this situation, you will not receive a <strong>ListenComplete</strong> event until the listening key's mode completes.</p>
<p>The event returns the character to the clients that currently have this character loaded. All other clients receive a null character (empty string).</p>

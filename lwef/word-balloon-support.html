<h1>Word Balloon Support</h1>
<p>[Microsoft Agent is deprecated as of Windows 7, and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.]</p>
<p>Spoken output can also appear as textual output in the form of a cartoon word balloon. This can be used to supplement the spoken output of a character or as an alternative to audio output when you use the <a href="speak-method.html"><strong>Speak</strong></a> method.</p>
<p><img src="images/f3ballon.gif" alt="yes master word balloon" /></p>
<p>You can also use a word balloon to communicate what a character is &quot;thinking&quot; using the <a href="think-method.html"><strong>Think</strong></a> method. This displays the text you supply in a still &quot;thought&quot; balloon. The <strong>Think</strong> method also differs from the <a href="speak-method.html"><strong>Speak</strong></a> method in that it produces no audio output.</p>
<p>Word balloons support only captioned communication from the character, not user input. Therefore, the word balloon does not support input controls. However, you can easily provide user input for a character, using interfaces from your programming language or the other input services provided by Microsoft Agent, such as the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>When you define a character, you can specify whether to include word balloon support. However, if you use a character that includes word balloon support, you cannot disable the support.</p>

<h1>Sharing Files and Memory</h1>
<p>File mapping can be used to share a file or memory between two or more processes. To share a file or memory, all of the processes must use the name or the handle of the same file mapping object.</p>
<p>To share a file, the first process creates or opens a file by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a> function. Next, it creates a file mapping object by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-createfilemappinga"><strong>CreateFileMapping</strong></a> function, specifying the file handle and a name for the file mapping object. The names of event, semaphore, mutex, waitable timer, job, and file mapping objects share the same namespace. Therefore, the <strong>CreateFileMapping</strong> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-openfilemappinga"><strong>OpenFileMapping</strong></a> functions fail if they specify a name that is in use by an object of another type.</p>
<p>To share memory that is not associated with a file, a process must use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-createfilemappinga"><strong>CreateFileMapping</strong></a> function and specify INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE as the <em>hFile</em> parameter instead of an existing file handle. The corresponding file mapping object accesses memory backed by the system paging file. You must specify a size greater than zero when you specify an <em>hFile</em> of INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE in a call to <strong>CreateFileMapping</strong>.</p>
<p>The easiest way for other processes to obtain a handle of the file mapping object created by the first process is to use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-openfilemappinga"><strong>OpenFileMapping</strong></a> function and specify the object's name. This is referred to as <em>named shared memory</em>. If the file mapping object does not have a name, the process must obtain a handle to it through inheritance or duplication. For more information on inheritance and duplication, see <a href="../procthread/inheritance.html">Inheritance</a>.</p>
<p>Processes that share files or memory must create file views by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-mapviewoffile"><strong>MapViewOfFile</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-mapviewoffileex"><strong>MapViewOfFileEx</strong></a> function. They must coordinate their access using semaphores, mutexes, events, or some other mutual exclusion technique. For more information, see <a href="../sync/synchronization.html">Synchronization</a>.</p>
<p>A shared file mapping object will not be destroyed until all processes that use it close their handles to it by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle"><strong>CloseHandle</strong></a> function.</p>

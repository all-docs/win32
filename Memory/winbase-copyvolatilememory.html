<h1>CopyVolatileMemory function</h1>
<p>The <strong>CopyVolatileMemory</strong> function copies the contents of a source memory block to a destination memory block.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
Some information relates to a prerelease product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>Param Destination [out]</h3>
<p>A pointer to the starting address of the copied block's destination.</p>
<h3>Param Source [in]</h3>
<p>A pointer to the starting address of the block of memory to copy.</p>
<h3>Param Length [in]</h3>
<p>The size of the block of memory to copy, in bytes.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>volatile void* __cdecl
  CopyVolatileMemory (
    _Out_writes_bytes_all_(Length) volatile void* Destination,
    _In_reads_bytes_(Length) volatile const void* Source,
    SIZE_T Length
  );
</code></pre>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This API exists to provide <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa366535(v=vs.85)">CopyMemory</a> behavior (i.e., copying memory from one location to another) in situations where the developer needs to be sure that the copy operation occurs (i.e., is not subject to compiler optimizations).</p>
<p>The API has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The API is not recognized as a compiler intrinsic so the compiler will never optimize away the call (either entirely or replace the call with an &quot;equivalent&quot; sequence of instructions). This differs from <strong>CopyMemory</strong> which is subject to a variety of compiler optimizations.</li>
<li>When the call returns, the data has been copied from <em>Source</em> to <em>Destination</em>. This functions memory accesses to the <em>Source</em> and <em>Destination</em> will only be performed within the function (i.e. the compiler cannot move memory accesses out of this function).</li>
<li>The API may perform unaligned memory accesses if the platform allows for it.</li>
<li>The API may access memory locations more than once as part of its copy operation.</li>
<li>Similar to <strong>CopyMemory</strong> in that it does not support copy operations when <em>Source</em> and <em>Destination</em> overlap each other.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
This function works on all versions of Windows, not just the latest. You need to consume the latest SDK to get the function declaration from the <code>winbase.h</code> header. You also need the library (<code>volatileaccessu.lib</code>) from the latest SDK. However, the resulting binary will run fine on older versions of Windows.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre lang="c"><code>HEADER MyHeader;
UCHAR RawBuffer[100];

// Ensure that the shared memory (which could be constantly changing)
// is copied in to the local MyHeader variable.
// Note that the compiler is allowed to optimize away calls to
// CopyMemory/RtlCopyMemory so those functions are not guaranteed to actually
// make a local copy of data.
//
// CopyVolatileMemory does not handle a source/dest buffer that overlap
// with each other (CopyMemory semantics).
//
// Assume SharedMemory points to virtual memory that is also mapped in an untrusted process.
// Assume that untrusted process is changing the memory contents while you are accessing it.
PVOID SharedMemory;

CopyVolatileMemory(&amp;MyHeader, SharedMemory, sizeof(MyHeader));

if (MyHeader.Size &lt; 100) {
  // Because MyHeader is local and we are guaranteed we actually made
  // a local copy, we can be sure that the &quot;Size&quot; value will not change
  // between the previous bounds check and the below call to RtlFillMemory.
  // If RtlCopyMemory/RtlCopyMemory had been used to copy the data, it is possible
  // that a compiler may optimize away the call to CopyMemory and instead fetch
  // the â€œsizeâ€ field of MyHeader directly from untrusted memory two times.
  // The first time it would be fetched for the bounds check, and the second
  // time it is fetched is for the call to FillMemory. It is possible the memory
  // could have changed between the two accesses resulting in the size check
  // being ineffective.

  FillMemory (RawBuffer, MyHeader.Size, 0);
}

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>Minimum supported client:</strong> Windows 11 Insider Preview Build TBD</p>
<p><strong>Header:</strong> winbase.h (include Winbase.h)</p>
<p><strong>Kernel-mode library:</strong> volatileaccessk.lib</p>
<p><strong>User-mode library:</strong> volatileaccessu.lib</p>

<h1>Memory Management Registry Keys</h1>
<p>System virtual address (VA) space on 32-bit systems can become exhausted due to fragmentation. Several registry keys can be used to configure memory limits on 32-bit systems that experience this issue. System VA space on 64-bit systems is not subject to exhaustion by fragmentation; therefore, these keys have no effect on 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>For 32-bit systems, these memory management registry keys must be explicitly created under the following registry key:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>SYSTEM</strong>\<strong>Current Control Set</strong>\<strong>Control</strong>\<strong>Session Manager</strong>\<strong>Memory Management</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2008 and WindowsÂ Vista:</strong> These registry keys are available on 32-bit systems starting with Windows ServerÂ 2008 and WindowsÂ Vista with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1).</p>
<p>For default memory and address space limits on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, see <a href="memory-limits-for-windows-releases.html">Memory Limits for Windows Releases</a>.</p>
<p>The following table describes the memory management registry keys that can be used to configure memory limits on 32-bit systems. All of these keys have a REG_DWORD type and possible values that range from 0 through 2,048 MB. The default is 0, which means no limit is enforced. Values are automatically rounded up to the next system VA allocation boundary, which is 2 MB on 32-bit systems that have <a href="physical-address-extension.html">Physical Address Extension</a> (PAE) enabled and 4 MB on 32-bit systems that do not have PAE enabled.</p>

<p>Determining whether system VA space is being exhausted requires the use of a kernel debugger. For more information, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc267445.aspx">Debugging Tools for Windows</a>.</p>

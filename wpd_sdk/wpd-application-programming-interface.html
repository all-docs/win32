<h1>WPD Application Programming Interface</h1>
<p>Applications built on Windows Portable Devices can explore a device, send and receive content, and even control the device, for example, take a picture or send a text message. The system is designed to be flexible so that many types of devices can be explored, and extensible so that driver developers can define custom properties and commands for custom devices.</p>
<p>The following table describes the main topics of this documentation.</p>

<p>Applications built on Windows Media Device Manager or Windows Image Acquisition can access Windows Portable Devices through a compatibility layer.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides several drivers for standard protocols and devices, including Media Transport Protocol (MTP) devices and Mass Storage Class (MSC) devices. If you are familiar with the User-Mode Driver Framework, you can develop your own drivers for custom devices.</p>

<h1>Implementing Property Sheet Extensions</h1>
<p>The WPD Namespace Extension supports extensible property sheets. These are the property dialogs that appear when a user right-clicks on an object, such as a file or a folder, and selects <strong>Properties</strong>. Some WPD applications will take advantage of these extensible property sheets to display properties for device-side content (or objects that reside on the device).</p>
<p>Extensible property sheets are supported by the interfaces described in the following table. For more information about any of these interfaces, see the Windows SDK.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Interface</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>IDataObject</td>
<td>Used to pass the context menu's PIDL array to the context menu handler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IPropertySetStorage</td>
<td>This interface is used to retrieve WPD properties for the given object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IPropertyStorage</td>
<td>This interface is also used to retrieve WPD properties for the given object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IShellExtInit</td>
<td>Initializes the Windows Vista Shell extensions for the context menu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IShellPropSheetExt</td>
<td>Supports addition of property sheet extensions.</td>
</tr>

<p>Property sheets for WPD are implemented like any other property sheet in Windows Vista. If you've already implemented a property sheet handler, you can modify your existing code so that it supports device-side content. If you've never created a context menu handler, see the Creating Property Sheet Handlers topic in the Windows SDK.</p>
<p>The two points at which a WPD property sheet handler differs from any other handler is in the handler registration and the support of device-side content.</p>

<h1>Application Overview</h1>
<p>Windows Portable Devices (WPD) provides an infrastructure that enables PC access to multifunction devices which store various media and non-media content. This infrastructure enables convergent devices and is initially focused on smart storage devices such as portable media players, digital still cameras, and mobile phones.</p>
<p>WPD consists of a Device Driver Interface (DDI) and a set of application programming interfaces (APIs). This overview describes how you can take advantage of these APIs in your Windows application.</p>
<p>The WPD infrastructure offers highly extensible device representation and control mechanisms. This enables vertical solution providers to use the WPD API to create enhanced user experiences that are outside of the WPD standardized set. Examples of this include vendor-provided software that performs firmware updates or device diagnostics (for remote support).</p>

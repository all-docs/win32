<h1>WpdServicesApiSample sample app</h1>
<p>A device service is an extension of a functional object: in addition to logically grouping device capabilities, a device service provides applications with the ability to programmatically discover those capabilities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/Win7Samples/multimedia/wpd/WpdServicesApiSample/cpp">WpdServicesApiSample sample application</a> is a command-line desktop application that you can use to explore Contacts services on devices attached to your computer. You can explore these services by listing supported: formats, events, methods, and abstract services. You can also use this application retrieve the properties on a given Contact service and to invoke methods supported by that service.</p>
<p>If you don't yet have a device that supports Contacts services, you can still run the WpdServicesApiSample if you first install the WpdServiceSampleDriver that is included in the Windows Driver Kit.</p>
<p>The WpdServicesApiSample sample application includes the following files:</p>

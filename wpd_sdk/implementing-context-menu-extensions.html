<h1>Implementing Context Menu Extensions</h1>
<p>The WPD Namespace Extension supports extensible context (or shortcut) menus. These are the menus that appear when a user right-clicks on an object such as a file or a folder. Some WPD applications will take advantage of these extensible menus to support operations on device-side content (or objects that reside on the device).</p>
<p>Extensible context menus are supported by the interfaces described in the following table. For more information about any of these interfaces, see the Windows SDK.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Interface</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>IContextMenu</td>
<td>The Windows Vista Shell calls the methods in this interface to create or merge the new context menu with the given object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IDataObject</td>
<td>Used to pass the context menu's PIDL array to the context menu handler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IPropertySetStorage</td>
<td>This interface is used to retrieve WPD properties for the given object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IPropertyStorage</td>
<td>This interface is also used to retrieve WPD properties for the given object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IShellExtInit</td>
<td>Initializes the Windows Vista Shell extensions for the context menu.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IStream</td>
<td>To be supplied.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Context menus for WPD are implemented like any other context menu in Windows Vista. If you've already implemented a context menu handler, you can modify your existing code so that it supports device-side content. If you have never created a context menu handler, see the Creating Context Menu Handlers topic in the Windows SDK.</p>
<p>The two points at which a WPD context menu handler differs from any other handler is in the handler registration and the support of device-side content.</p>

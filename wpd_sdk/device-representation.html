<h1>Device Representation</h1>
<p>Devices have two main behaviors that are addressed by the Windows Portable Devices (WPD) architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessing and storing content. For example, applications must be able to add music files to a portable music player.</li>
<li>Programming the device. This includes simple operations such as changing settings and preparing the device for data capture, or more complex operations such as uploading firmware. Examples include issuing a &quot;Take Picture&quot; command to a digital still camera.</li>
</ul>
<p>In WPD, these behaviors are described by representing the device as a hierarchy of objects. The following illustration shows a WPD object representation for a multi-function device, which in this case is a mobile phone.</p>
<p><img src="images/wpd-overview-figure3.gif" alt="illustration showing hierarchy of objects for a mobile phone" /></p>
<p>This hierarchy illustrates the following functionality and contents.</p>
<p>Functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage object. This device has data storage.</li>
<li>Contacts Service. This service is a functional object that can be used to synchronize and store contacts on the phone.</li>
<li>SMS Service. This service is a functional object that can be used to send, receive, and store SMS messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media objects. This device stores images, music, and video files in folders on the Storage object. While the files shown in the illustration are stored under one folder, a device can subdivide content into folders organized by the type of media stored; for example, image folders, music folders, and video folders.</li>
<li>Contact objects. This device stores contact information (such as name, phone number, and address) as children of the Contacts Service</li>
<li>Message objects. This device stores SMS messages as children of the SMS Service.</li>
</ul>

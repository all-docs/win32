<h1>Binding to an ADSI Object</h1>
<p>Connecting to an object in a directory service is known as binding. Binding to an ADSI object is the first step to communicating with the underlying directory system. An object must be bound to in order to navigate its namespace, search for data, modify data, or impersonate a user. It is also possible to supply additional binding characteristics, such as user name, password, server name, encryption methods, and secured authentication. The actual additional binding characteristics that can be used will depend on the provider.</p>

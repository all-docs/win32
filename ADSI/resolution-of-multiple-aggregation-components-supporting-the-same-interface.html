<h1>Resolution of Multiple Aggregation Components Supporting the Same Interface</h1>
<p>It is uncommon that two extensions expose the same interface to ADSI. If this happens, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an interface, such as <strong>IMyInterface</strong>, is supported by both the aggregator (ADSI) and any extension objects, <strong>QueryInterface</strong> always returns the <strong>IMyInterface</strong> for ADSI.</li>
<li>If an interface, such as <strong>IMyInterface</strong>, is not supported by the aggregator (ADSI), but is supported by more than one extension object, <strong>QueryInterface</strong> returns the <strong>IMyInterface</strong> of the first extension object listed in the registry that supports the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that the order of components in the registry also affects the resolution of name conflicts in Automation.

<h1>Accessing Active Directory Using Visual Basic</h1>
<p>One of the most powerful features that became available with the Microsoft WindowsÂ 2000 operating system is the Microsoft Active Directory directory service. When you log on to a WindowsÂ 2000 domain, Active Directory is put into action; to search for the closest color printer in your building, you can use Active Directory. It can be used for an address book lookup or a search for users who work in building 40. With Active Directory, you can use a smart card to log on to a WindowsÂ 2000 domain. You can even join data from Microsoft SQL Server database software and Active Directory.</p>
<p>Many other Microsoft technologies, such as Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ), COM (Class Store), Internet Protocol security (IPsec), Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and Exchange are integrated with Active Directory.</p>
<p>This section discusses how to use the Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) to access Active Directory. Using a scenario for a fictitious company â€” the Fabrikam Corporation â€” you will learn how to perform some basic administrative tasks.</p>
<p>As you progress through this scenario, the code examples in each section build upon themselves.</p>
<p>For brevity, all code examples are written with the Microsoft Visual Basic development system. For more information about C++ conversion, see <a href="mapping-adsi-visual-basic-code-to-c-code.html">Mapping ADSI Visual Basic Code to C++ Code</a>.</p>

<h1>Active Directory Service Interfaces Architecture</h1>
<p>Many directory services are hierarchical and thus lend themselves to a hierarchical object model. This section uses COM object representations to illustrate various ADSI features.</p>
<p>In the following object model figure, a top-level system object contains one Namespace object for every installed ADSI provider.</p>
<p><img src="images/ds2top.png" alt="namespaces container object" /></p>
<p>Each of the Namespace objects is itself a container that contains the top-level root nodes of every server, domain, or whatever other kinds of directory-system objects are defined as roots in each directory service.</p>
<p>ADSI supplies a set of predefined objects and interfaces so that client applications can interact with directory services using a uniform set of methods. However, ADSI may not provide access to all features of a directory service. To better use the full feature set of each directory service, ADSI supplies a schema model that directory service providers and third-party software vendors can use to extend features beyond the interfaces provided in ADSI.</p>
<p>The root-node container objects, found within each provider Namespace object, include an ADSI schema container object. This object contains the definition of all features for that provider. For more information, see <a href="adsi-schema-model.html">ADSI Schema Model</a>.</p>

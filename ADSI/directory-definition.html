<h1>Directory Definition</h1>
<p>The example provider component uses a relatively simple directory design to clarify the relationship between components and to show the minimum requirements necessary to be an ADSI provider.</p>
<p>The &quot;directory&quot; for the example provider component consists of two root nodes: &quot;Seattle&quot; and &quot;Toronto&quot;. Seattle contains two more sublevels, &quot;Bellevue&quot; and &quot;Redmond&quot;. Each of these entries contains several user accounts. The &quot;Toronto&quot; entry has no further sublevels, but directly contains several user accounts. The following figure shows these two root nodes connected to a network.</p>

<p>In hierarchical terms, the Namespace node contains &quot;Seattle&quot; and &quot;Toronto&quot;. &quot;Seattle&quot; contains &quot;Bellevue&quot; and &quot;Redmond&quot;. &quot;Bellevue&quot; and &quot;Redmond&quot; each contain a set of user accounts. &quot;Toronto&quot; directly contains the user accounts with no intermediate organizational nodes.</p>
<p>The example provider component represents this structure with only two Active Directory object types: a container object and a leaf object. &quot;Seattle&quot;, &quot;Toronto&quot;, &quot;Bellevue&quot;, and &quot;Redmond&quot; are container objects and each user account is a leaf object.</p>
<p>The example provider component creates a schema class called &quot;Organizational Unit&quot; for a container object type and a schema class called &quot;User&quot; for a user account.</p>
<p>The properties for each schema class, their methods, and the rules that govern the containment relationships for these objects are all defined in <a href="schema-management.html">Schema Management</a>.</p>

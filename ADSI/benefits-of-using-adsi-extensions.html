<h1>Benefits of Using ADSI Extensions</h1>
<p>The way in which extension methods are implemented depends on the extension writer. An extension writer may even implement a method completely outside the scope of the directory. For example, a developer of backup and restore software plans to extend an object called <strong>computer</strong>. The developer must create two methods: <strong>BackUp</strong> and <strong>Restore</strong>. These methods operate remotely on the physical computer that the <strong>computer</strong> object in the directory points to. By acting as an extension, the component accesses the ADSI infrastructure and is viewed by ADSI clients as an integral part of the object.</p>
<p>The following scenarios describe situations where creating an extension to ADSI would be advantageous:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create an extension to integrate a component with the directory object. Because there is a <strong>user</strong> object in the directory, an HR developer may wish to create an ADSI extension that populates other data in the directory when a <strong>user</strong> is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an extension if a component requires a directory lookup. A component may require a directory as a starting point for a lookup. For example, when creating a new application. An application object, <strong>ToolApp</strong>, can be published in the directory. Your application may support status notifications on a collection of mail servers. You decide to make this application an ADSI extension.</p>
<p>Now, a user may search for all instances of <strong>ToolApp</strong> in the directory. For each object returned, the user may issue a call to <strong>NotifyNow()</strong>. An application or extension can obtain more current object data in the directory and notify each server asynchronously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an extension as a junction between namespaces and programming models. For example, an ISV invents a new object model for print services. The <strong>printQueue</strong> object is already defined in the directory. The ISV can create an ADSI extension and associate it with the <strong>printQueue</strong> object. ADSI users can bind to a <strong>printQueue</strong> object and start using the object model for the ISV. From the ADSI client perspective, this junction point is transparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an extension to simplify tasks. Many tasks in the directory can be accomplished by searching and setting multiple attributes in an object or multiple objects. By creating a single function to manipulate multiple attributes, it simplifies development for application and script writers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For ADSI clients, extensions enrich the ADSI programming environment in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers creating ADSI clients do not have to learn a new programming model. The extensions are part of ADSI. They would use the same paradigm for searching, data manipulation, and securing objects.</li>
<li>Administrators can manage related directory-enabled applications using extensions.</li>
<li>Extension consumers can view an ADSI object and extension as one integrated object.</li>
<li>Existing components may be integrated with ADSI, which enables extensions to leverage existing investments and create synergy between components.</li>
</ul>
<p>ADSI extensions were designed with the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement. With the current existing Microsoft technologies, Microsoft Visual C++ development system, and the Active Template Library, an extension can be created quickly.</li>
<li>Clients view one IDispatch. From the perspective of script and Automation writers, the extension methods and properties are transparently blended into one ADSI object.</li>
<li>Independent. Extension writers can independently extend ADSI without prior knowledge of existing extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider this scenario: A corporate developer or an ISV needs to develop a backup program. This backup application enables an administrator to back up all computers in an organizational unit. With an ADSI extension, the following script is possible.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Dim ou
On Error Resume Next
Set ou = GetObject(&quot;LDAP://OU=Sales, DC=Fabrikam, DC=COM&quot;)
If Err.Number&lt;&gt;0 Then
    MsgBox(&quot;An error has occurred.&quot;)
    Err.Clear
    Set ou = Nothing
    Exit Sub
End If

ou.Filter = Array(&quot;computer&quot;)

For each comp in ou
   Debug.Print comp.Get(&quot;networkAddress&quot;)
   Debug.Print comp.LastBackUp
   comp.BackUpNow
Next
</code></pre>
<p><strong>LastBackUp</strong> is a property and <strong>BackUpNow</strong> is a method that the extension writer provides. The code shows the benefits for both extension consumers and providers. The extension writer does not have to create a new way of filtering, searching, and accessing the directory. The extension consumer does not have to relearn a new programming paradigm. New methods and properties that the extension writer provides are viewed as part of ADSI.</p>

<h1>Search Time Limit</h1>
<p>When you request a search on a server that is under a heavy workload, you may want to instruct the server to restrict the search to a specified time limit. For example, to execute an application to generate a weekly report on a server that is running near capacity, and to avoid maximizing the CPU time and preventing other jobs from running, you can set the search time to a small value and rerun the application later if it fails to generate the report.</p>
<p>Some servers can impose their own administrative time limit. In these cases, if you specify a search time limit value greater than the administrative time limit, the server ignores your specification and use its internal administrative time limit instead.</p>

<h1>Mapping Solutions onto the Parental Controls Infrastructure</h1>
<p>Five categories of common ISV and ISP/portal parental-controls aware offerings are readily apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone client application. Examples are email clients and media players. Although media players have Internet-facing risk and some have specific services, Windows Parental Controls primarily promotes logging and restrictions on playback activities only to minimize library impacts and logging noise to administrators.</li>
<li>Client/server solutions. The most prominent examples are instant messaging solutions.</li>
<li>ISP suites. These are collections of client/server solutions and client applications, often integrated in a single client user interface. Note that most of these also provide most or all functionality by using browser access, crossing over into web-only solutions.</li>
<li>Web-only solutions. Accessed through browser. Examples are web-based email and instant messaging functionality. Access to these may be blocked by appropriately populated web filter categories.</li>
<li>Firewall-like solutions. Provides filtering at the network stack level, and potentially other operating system restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recommendations for implementing compliant solutions for each category are specified in the following table.</p>

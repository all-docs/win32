<h1>Parental Controls</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>As part of the Family Safety efforts of Microsoft, Windows provides Parental Controls functionality to monitor and limit exposure of selected computer users to online dangers and inappropriate content.</p>

<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>Independent software vendors (ISVs) of products that potentially expose users to safety risks or that are currently working to protect users from such risks are encouraged to integrate Parental Controls.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>

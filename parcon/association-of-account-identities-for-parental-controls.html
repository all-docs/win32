<h1>Association of Account Identities for Parental Controls</h1>
<p>As discussed in the Introduction, effective use of the configuration, logging, and restrictions functionality provided by the WindowsÂ Vista Parental Controls infrastructure depends on Windows accounts being set up as standard users. It is recommended that vendors providing online access (such as ISP suites) create and maintain an association of online user names allowed by the parent or guardian for each controlled Windows account. In this way, bypassing of cloud-based parental controls merely by using alternative online identities is reduced.</p>

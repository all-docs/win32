<h1>Unblocking blocked browser by attesting to provide safe browsing to member accounts</h1>
<p>By attesting through this registry key, you are ensuring that your browser will provide safety measures and settings to a member account.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the browsers add this registry key and provide the self-attestation.</p>
<p>To determine if the user is a child, see <a href="using-parental-controls-reg-key.html">Using the Parental Controls Registry Key</a>.</p>
<h2>Child safety registry keys</h2>
<p>To unblock your browser, please update the following registry keys:</p>
<p>32 bit registry key:</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ChildSafety
</code></pre>
<p>64 bit registry key:</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ChildSafety
</code></pre>
<p>:::image type=&quot;content&quot; source=&quot;../images/child-safety-registry-keys.png&quot; alt-text=&quot;Child safety registry keys&quot;:::</p>
<h2>Additional information</h2>
<p>Some important points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The executable name in the registry entry should match the name of the browser's executable file (.exe).</li>
<li>If the .exe name is changed in the future, please update the registry entry with the new executable name to ensure that the browser remains unblocked.</li>
</ul>

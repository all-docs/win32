<h1>Parental Controls Activity Reporting</h1>
<p>Activity reporting is considered essential given social engineering issues. Aware applications or filters are requested to log activities as specified in the Using Parental Controls APIs section.</p>
<p>Clicking the Activity reporting link brings up a Log Viewer page showing all log entries for a maximum one week interval (further bounded by log size limits), with category tree and column format data panes.</p>
<p>The summary box in the upper right of the Parental Controls Panel indicates current status for activity reporting.</p>
<p>Activity events are also visible in the Event Viewer with a name of Microsoft.com/Windows/ParentalControls in the Application Logs.</p>
<p>This functionality depends on the new Event Logging functionality in WindowsÂ Vista, using the provided Publishing APIs.</p>

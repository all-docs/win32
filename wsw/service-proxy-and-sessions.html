<h1>Service Proxy and Sessions</h1>
<p>The <a href="service-proxy.html">service proxy</a> has special behaviors for session and non-session-based channel bindings. The service proxy provides session based semantics if the underlying channel binding is session based. In this case a single channel is used to service calls. However, if the channel binding is not session based, the service proxy creates a separate channel for each call. Note, though, that non-session-based channels are pooled and maybe reused. In reusing a channel, the service proxy keeps the channel open if the underlying channel has not faulted or the call on a channel has resulted in the service proxy's faulting the channel. Note that. except in the event of a fault, once a channel is opened it is kept open as long as the service proxy is open and is closed only when the service proxy is closed.</p>
<p>If the channel binding is session based and if the underlying channel faults, the service proxy state machine will transition into the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ne-webservices-ws_service_proxy_state"><strong>WS_SERVICE_PROXY_STATE_FAULTED</strong></a> state. In the case of non-session based channel binding, a fault in the underlying channel does not cause the proxy to transition into <strong>WS_SERVICE_PROXY_STATE_FAULTED</strong> state.</p>
<p>For more information on the service proxy and its relation to state, see the <a href="service-proxy.html">Service Proxy</a> topic. For examples of different channel bindings see the following examples:</p>

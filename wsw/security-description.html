<h1>Security Description</h1>
<p>A security desciption is represented by a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ns-webservices-ws_security_description"><strong>WS_SECURITY_DESCRIPTION</strong></a> structure, and an instance of a security description is supplied when you call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wscreatechannel"><strong>WsCreateChannel</strong></a> function to create a secure channel or the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/nf-webservices-wscreatelistener"><strong>WsCreateListener</strong></a> function to create a listener.</p>
<h2>Structure of a Security Description</h2>
<p>The basic model of channel security is that a channel is secured with one or more security tokens. Reflecting this model, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ns-webservices-ws_security_description"><strong>WS_SECURITY_DESCRIPTION</strong></a> structure contains a list of security bindings, represented by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WebServices/ns-webservices-ws_security_binding"><strong>WS_SECURITY_BINDING</strong></a> structures, and each security binding describes how one security token is obtained and used on the channel. The kind of security used on a channel is decided by the selection of security binding subtypes that are included in the security description.</p>
<p>Optional security settings that are specific to a security binding are specified as <a href="security-binding-settings.html">security binding settings</a> in the security binding structure; however, channel-wide settings independent of security bindings are directly specified as <a href="security-channel-settings.html">security channel settings</a> in the <strong>properties</strong> field of the security description itself.</p>

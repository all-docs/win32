<h1>Security and Identity</h1>
<p>Develop more secure desktop apps by using Windows APIs and services. These APIs provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Authorization</li>
<li>Cryptography</li>
<li>Directory, identity, and access services</li>
<li>Parental controls</li>
<li>Rights management</li>
</ul>
<p>This section also provides best practices and other security articles.</p>

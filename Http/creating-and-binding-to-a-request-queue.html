<h1>Creating and Binding to a Request Queue</h1>
<p>A request queue is a service queue that holds pending requests for a specific application. An application creates the request queue independently of the URL group or server session by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreaterequestqueue"><strong>HttpCreateRequestQueue</strong></a> function, and sets the request queue properties by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpsetrequestqueueproperty"><strong>HttpSetRequestQueueProperty</strong></a> function. These properties are the verbosity of 503 responses, the maximum length of the queue, and the activity state.</p>
<p>To cause requests to be routed to its request queue, the application binds the URL group it created as part of <a href="run-time-configuration.html">run-time configuration</a> to the queue by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpseturlgroupproperty"><strong>HttpSetUrlGroupProperty</strong></a> with <strong>HttpServerBindingProperty</strong> specified in the <em>Property</em> parameter. Incoming requests from the URLs in the group are then routed to the specified request queue.</p>

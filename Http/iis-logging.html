<h1>IIS Logging</h1>
<p>IIS logging is one type of server side logging that can be enabled on a URL group. The IIS log file format is a fixed ASCII text-based format that cannot be customized. The IIS log file contains the HTTP Server API kernel-mode cache hits. This type of logging can be enabled on a URL group only; it cannot be used on the server session.</p>
<p>The IIS log file format records the following data. The data in the table is in the order of occurrence in the log file.</p>

<p>Not all fields will contain information. For fields for which there is no information, a hyphen (-) appears as a placeholder. If a field contains a nonprintable character, the HTTP Server API replaces it with a plus sign (+) to preserve the log file format. This typically occurs with virus attacks, when, for example, a malicious user sends carriage returns and line feeds that, if not replaced with the plus sign (+), would break the log file format. Fields are separated by commas, making the format easier to read than the other ASCII formats, which use spaces for separators. The time is recorded as local time. The time taken is recorded in milliseconds. For more information about the time taken field, see the <a href="w3c-logging.html">W3C Logging</a> topic.</p>

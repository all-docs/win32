<h1>Processing Requests</h1>
<p>Processing requests includes four steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving a request</li>
<li>Handling the request</li>
<li>Sending the response</li>
<li>Canceling requests that cannot be processed</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/processloop.png" alt="Diagram that shows the process request loop." /></p>
<h2>Receiving a Request</h2>
<p>The HTTP Server API supplies a request structure to store the parsed incoming request. This structure is allocated by the application, and initialized when an incoming request is received. The application calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpreceivehttprequest"><strong>HttpReceiveHttpRequest</strong></a> function to receive the request. If the request buffer is too small to receive the request, the application can increase the buffer size and call <strong>HttpReceiveHttpRequest</strong> again to receive the entire request.</p>
<p>If the request includes entity body data to be received, the applications calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpreceiverequestentitybody"><strong>HttpReceiveRequestEntityBody</strong></a> with the request ID returned in the <em>pRequestBuffer</em> parameter during the call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpreceivehttprequest"><strong>HttpReceiveHttpRequest</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Handling the Request</h2>
<p>The application performs application-specific processing of the request and formulates a response. The HTTP Server API imposes no timeout on this process.</p>
<h2>Sending the Response</h2>
<p>When the application is finished handling the request and formulating the response, it calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpsendhttpresponse"><strong>HttpSendHttpResponse</strong></a> function to send the response. If the response includes entity body data to send, the application also calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpsendresponseentitybody">HttpSendResponseEntityBody</a>.</p>
<h2>Canceling Requests</h2>
<p>After the application has received a request ID from its call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpreceivehttprequest"><strong>HttpReceiveHttpRequest</strong></a>, it can at any time cancel the request by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcancelhttprequest">HttpCancelHttpRequest</a>.</p>

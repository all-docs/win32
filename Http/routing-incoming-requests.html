<h1>Routing Incoming Requests</h1>
<p>The HTTP Server API maintains a routing database to determine which application receives an incoming request. The routing table is built from the reservation database and contains reservation entries as well as current registrations. When a registration or reservation is made, it is placed into the routing database bucket that corresponds to the host type as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>+ : port registrations are placed in the &quot;Strong Wildcard&quot; bucket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>host : port registrations are placed in the &quot;Explicit&quot; bucket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IP : port registrations are placed in the &quot;IP-bound Weak Wildcard&quot; bucket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>* : port registrations are placed in the &quot;Weak Wildcard&quot; bucket</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps also refer to the order incoming HTTP requests are processed. The strong wildcard reservations first, then the explicit reservation are checked followed by the IP-bound weak wildcard and weak wildcard. The search stops when a match is found so that registrations in any of the remaining buckets are not found.</p>
<p>The HTTP Server API routing algorithm locates the best match for the <a href="urlprefix-strings.html">UrlPrefix</a> by searching both the registration entries and the reservation entries of the routing database, starting with the strong wildcard bucket and ending with the weak wildcard bucket. The best match, within a bucket, is the longest match in the relative URI portion of the UrlPrefix (assuming an exact match for the host, port and scheme portions of the URL). After a match is found in a bucket, the routing algorithm stops its search and skips all lower priority buckets.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following registrations (listed in descending order of priority based on bucket types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registration: <code>https://+:80/vroot/</code> is registered by application 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration: <code>https://adatum.com:80/</code> is registered by application 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registration: <code>https://\*:80/</code> is registered by application 3</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An incoming request for <code>https://adatum.com:80/vroot/subdir/file.htm/</code> is delivered to application 1. An incoming request for <code>https://adatum.com:80/default.htm/</code> is delivered to application 2. An incoming request for <code>https://otheradatum.com:80/file.htm/</code> is delivered to application 3.</p>
<p>If the best match is a reservation entry, this means that the application that should receive the request is not running. For example, consider the following registration and reservation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Registration: <code>https://\*:80/vroot/</code> is registered by application 1, user A</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reservation: <code>https://adatum.com:80/</code> has been reserved for user B</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An incoming request for <code>https://adatum.com:80/vroot/file.htm/</code> is not delivered to application 1 because the best match leads to the reservation entry for user B. The precedence rules are applied in this case to the reservation which has a higher priority. If no process is active that is authorized and registered to service requests for the URL received, the request is rejected with a 400 status code (Bad Request).</p>

<h1>Versioning (HTTP Server API)</h1>
<p>The HTTP Server version 2.0 API makes obsolete the version 1.0 request queues and URL associations with the request queue. Object-scoped versioning allows applications to supply application-specific version information. An applications can automatically call the correct version of structures for the operating system on which it is running.</p>
<h2>Request Queues</h2>
<p>Starting with HTTP Server version 2.0 API, request queues are created with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreaterequestqueue"><strong>HttpCreateRequestQueue</strong></a> making obsolete the version 1.0 <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreatehttphandle"><strong>HttpCreateHttpHandle</strong></a> function. URL groups are introduced in version 2.0 with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreateurlgroup"><strong>HttpCreateUrlGroup</strong></a> function. URLs are added to the group using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpaddurltourlgroup"><strong>HttpAddUrlToUrlGroup</strong></a> which makes obsolete the version 1.0 <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpaddurl"><strong>HttpAddUrl</strong></a> function. Version 2.0 URL groups must not be used with version 1.0 request queues.</p>
<p>Starting with version 2.0, the following version 1.0 functions are obsolete and cannot be used with version 2.0 request queues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreatehttphandle"><strong>HttpCreateHttpHandle</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpaddurl"><strong>HttpAddUrl</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpremoveurl"><strong>HttpRemoveUrl</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about configuring URL groups, see the <a href="configuring-the-url-group.html">Configuring the URL Group</a> topic. For more information about version 2.0 request queues, see the <a href="named-request-queue.html">Named Request Queue</a> topic.</p>
<h2>Object-Scoped Versioning</h2>
<p>In version 1.0, the application supplies the HTTP Server API version in the call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpinitialize"><strong>HttpInitialize</strong></a>. The version information is accepted only from the first application that called <strong>HttpInitialize</strong> and is applied to all the HTTP Server API applications in the same process. Starting with the version 2.0 API, the global version information supplied in the call to <strong>HttpInitialize</strong> is not used. For version 2.0 applications, the HTTP Server API version is passed in the Version parameter when the request queue or server session is created by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreaterequestqueue"><strong>HttpCreateRequestQueue</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreateserversession"><strong>HttpCreateServerSession</strong></a>. When the request queue is created with the version 1.0 <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpcreatehttphandle"><strong>HttpCreateHttpHandle</strong></a>, it is automatically marked as version 1.0. Both version 1.0 and version 2.0 applications can run in the same process.</p>
<p>The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa364545(v=vs.85)"><strong>HTTP_REQUEST</strong></a> and <a href="http-response.html"><strong>HTTP_RESPONSE</strong></a> structures are updated to include authentication information in the HTTP Server version 2.0 API. <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/ns-http-http_request_v1"><strong>HTTP_REQUEST_V1</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/ns-http-http_request_v2"><strong>HTTP_REQUEST_V2</strong></a> are specific to the version of the API used by the application. However, applications should not use these structures directly in their code; instead they should use <strong>HTTP_REQUEST</strong> to get the correct version based on the version of the request queue on which the request was received. Also, be aware that size of the <strong>HTTP_REQUEST</strong> structure is based on the version of the operating system under which the code is compiled.</p>

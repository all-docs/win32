<h1>Processing Registrations</h1>
<p>The HTTP Server APIs use the routing database to apply access checks during registrations. A registration for a <a href="urlprefix-strings.html">UrlPrefix</a> must pass a series of access checks to ensure that the user registering for the namespace has access rights. Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpaddurl"><strong>HttpAddUrl</strong></a> function to add a new registration.</p>
<p><strong>To add a new registration with HttpAddUrl</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If the port number in the UrlPrefix has reservations or registrations for a scheme different from the scheme in the UrlPrefix, the registration fails. HTTP and HTTPS cannot be supported on the same port.</li>
<li>The registration is slotted into the appropriate bucket for the registration. The buckets are based on the host type of the URL as outlined in the <a href="routing-incoming-requests.html">Routing Incoming Requests</a> section. The following steps are relative to this particular bucket.</li>
<li>If a duplicate registration entry exists, return an error code.</li>
<li>Select reservation entries with scheme, host and port components that are equal to those of the UrlPrefix. From these, locate the entry with the longest <strong>relativeUri</strong> match. If the entry exists, check permissions based on the ACL associated with that entry and return success. If the entry does not exist, return an ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS code.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following examples illustrate the process to install a registration in the routing database. Reservations 1 and 2 exist in the routing database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reservation 1: <code>https://+:80/vroot/subdir/</code> for User A and User C. This reservation is placed in the &quot;+&quot; bucket.</li>
<li>Reservation 2: <code>https://adatum.com:80/vroot/</code> for User B. This reservation is placed in the &quot;Explicit Host&quot; bucket.</li>
<li>Registration: <code>https://+:80/vroot/subdir/</code> by User B fails due to reservation 1.</li>
<li>Registration: <code>https://adatum.com:80/vroot/subdir/</code> by User B succeeds due to reservation 2.</li>
<li>Registration: <code>https://adatum.com:80/vroot/subdir/</code> by User C fails due to the more explicit reservation 2. The strong wildcard reservation does not have meaning within the context of the explicit reservation or registration.</li>
<li>Registration: <code>https://+:80/vroot/subdir/</code> by User A succeeds due to reservation 1.</li>
<li>Registration: <code>https://adatum.com:80/vroot/anotherdir/</code> by User B succeeds due to reservation 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>The access check for registration does not include checks for delegation privileges. There are no access checks based on reservations (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Http/nf-http-httpremoveurl"><strong>HttpRemoveUrl</strong></a>). The only requirement for deleting a registration us that the calling process must have created the registration.</p>

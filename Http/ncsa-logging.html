<h1>NCSA Logging</h1>
<p>NCSA extended logging is one type of server side logging that can be enabled on a URL group. The NCSA Common log file format is a fixed ASCII text-based format that cannot be customized. The NCSA log file contains the HTTP Server API kernel-mode cache hits. This type of logging can be enabled on a URL group only; it cannot be used on the server session.</p>
<p>The NCSA Common log file format records the following data. The data in the table is in the order of occurrence in the log file.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Remote host address</td>
<td>The IP address of the client that made the request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Remote log name</td>
<td>Not used. This value is always a hyphen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>User name</td>
<td>The name of the authenticated user that accessed the server. Anonymous users are indicated by a hyphen. The best practice is for the application always to provide the user name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date, time, and Greenwich mean time (GMT) offset</td>
<td>The local date and time at which the activity occurred. The offset from Greenwich mean time is also indicated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Request and Protocol version</td>
<td>The HTTP protocol version that the client used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Service status code</td>
<td>The HTTP status code. (A value of 200 indicates that the request completed successfully.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bytes sent</td>
<td>The number of bytes sent by the server.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Not all fields will contain information. For fields for which there is no information, a hyphen (-) appears as a placeholder. If a field contains a nonprintable character, the HTTP Server API replaces it with a plus sign (+) to preserve the log file format. This typically occurs with virus attacks, when, for example, a malicious user sends carriage returns and line feeds that, if not replaced with the plus sign (+), would break the log file format. Fields are separated by spaces, and the time is recorded as local time with the GMT offset.</p>
<p>The following example shows an NCSA Common log file entry, as viewed in a text editor.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>172.21.13.45 - Microsoft\JohnDoe [07/Apr/2004:17:39:04 -0800] 
&quot;GET /scripts/iisadmin/ism.dll?http/serv HTTP/1.0&quot; 200 3401
</code></pre>
<p>The IP address of the client is 172.21.13.45, and the user name is Microsoft\JohnDoe. The log was recorded on April 7, 2005 at 17:39:04 local time with a Greenwich offset of 8 hours. The request verb and protocol version were &quot;GET /scripts/iisadmin/ism.dll?http/serv HTTP/1.0&quot;. The status codes was 200 OK, and the number of bytes sent by the client was 3401.</p>

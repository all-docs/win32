<h1>Using the Auxiliary Library</h1>
<p>Using OpenGL, Silicon Graphics (SGI) created the Auxiliary Library to write simple sample programs for the <em>OpenGL Programming Guide</em>. The source code for the Auxiliary Library is supplied with the Microsoft Platform SDK, along with the OpenGL samples. To understand how the Auxiliary Library was developed from OpenGL functions and routines, examine the source code. You can use Auxiliary Library functions in your own programs. For a description of the Auxiliary Library, see the <em>OpenGL Programming Guide</em>.</p>

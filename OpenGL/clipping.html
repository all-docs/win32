<h1>Clipping (OpenGL)</h1>
<p>Clipping occurs in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>View volume clippingApplication-specific clipping.</strong> Immediately after primitives are assembled, they're clipped in eye coordinates as necessary for any clipping planes you've defined with <a href="glclipplane.html"><strong>glClipPlane</strong></a>. (OpenGL requires support for at least six such application-specific clipping planes.)</li>
<li>Primitives are transformed by the projection matrix into clip coordinates and clipped by the corresponding view volume. This matrix can be controlled by the matrix transformation functions (see <a href="matrix-transformations.html">Matrix Transformations</a>) but is typically specified by <a href="glfrustum.html"><strong>glFrustum</strong></a> or <a href="glortho.html"><strong>glOrtho</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Points, line segments, and polygons are handled differently during clipping:</p>
<ul>
<li>Points are either retained in their original state (if they're inside the clip volume) or discarded (if they're outside the clip volume).</li>
<li>If portions of line segments or polygons are outside the clip volume, new vertices are generated at the clip points.</li>
<li>For polygons, an entire edge may need to be constructed between new vertices generated at the clip points.</li>
<li>For line segments and polygons that are clipped, the edge flag, color, and texture information is assigned to all new vertices.</li>
</ul>

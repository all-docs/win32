<h1>Porting Applications from IRIS GL</h1>
<p>This section lists important differences between IRIS GL and OpenGL and describes the basic steps for porting code from IRIS GL to OpenGL. For a complete list of the differences between IRIS GL and Open GL, see <a href="iris-gl-and-opengl-differences.html">IRIS GL and OpenGL Differences</a>.</p>
<p>Porting IRIS GL programs to OpenGL for Windows requires considerably more work than converting OpenGL programs from the X Window System. While IRIS GL programs are designed to run with specific hardware and software, OpenGL was designed for portability among various systems.</p>
<p>The following table lists some of the key differences between OpenGL and IRIS GL programs.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>OpenGL code</th>
<th>IRIS GL code</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Operating system independent; contains no functions for windowing, event handling, buffer allocation/management, and so on.</td>
<td>Dependent on operating system; windowing-system functions are mixed with rendering functions. There is no windows manager in IRIS GL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Uses a standard, common naming convention. OpenGL functions and defined types begin with a &quot;gl&quot; prefix to prevent conflicts with other libraries.</td>
<td>Does not use a common naming convention for functions and defined types.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Manages state variables (such as color, fog, texture, lighting, and so on) directly and consistently. Does not use tables to load state-variable values.</td>
<td>Uses tables to manage state variables and must bind variables to table values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Display lists cannot be edited.</td>
<td>Display lists can be edited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does not provide a file format for fonts.</td>
<td>Provides functions to handle fonts and text strings and a file format for fonts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Includes a GL Utility (GLU) library that contains additional functions and routines (such as NURBS and quadratic rendering routines).</td>
<td>Does not support the GLU library.</td>

<p><strong>Use the following general procedure to port your IRIS GL programs to OpenGL</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Rewrite any code that makes calls to a window manager, window configuration, device, or event, or where you load a color map to equivalent Windows code. Rewriting an application from one operating system to another can be complex and difficult. This subject is beyond the scope of this section.</li>
<li>Locate any code that uses IRIS GL functions and routines. Translate these functions to their equivalent OpenGL functions. For a complete listing of IRIS GL functions and routines and their equivalent OpenGL counterparts, see <a href="opengl-functions-and-their-iris-gl-equivalents.html">OpenGL Functions and Their IRIS GL Equivalents</a>.</li>
<li>Change IRIS GL code as described in <a href="special-iris-gl-porting-issues.html">Special IRIS GL Porting Issues</a>.</li>

<h1>Choosing Between RGBA and Color-Index Mode</h1>
<p>In general, use the RGBA mode for your OpenGL applications; it provides more flexibility than the color-index mode for effects such as shading, lighting, color mapping, fog, antialiasing, and blending.</p>
<p>Consider using the color-index mode in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a limited number of bitplanes available; the color-index mode can produce less-coarse shading than the RGBA mode.</li>
<li>If you are not concerned about using &quot;real&quot; colors; for example, using several colors in a topographic map to designate relative elevations.</li>
<li>When you're porting an existing application that uses color-index mode extensively.</li>
<li>When you want to use color-map animation and effects in your application. (This is not possible on true-color devices.)</li>
</ul>

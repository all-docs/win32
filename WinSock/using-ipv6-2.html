<h1>Using IPv6</h1>
<p>On WindowsÂ XP a later, a new command-line tool is provided for configuring and managing IPv4. This tool uses the &quot;netsh interface ip&quot; command for configuring and managing IPv4.</p>
<p>On WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1) and later, this new command-line tool was enhanced to support the configuration and management of IPv6. This enhanced tool is the &quot;netsh interface ipv6&quot; command. Configuration changes made using the Netsh.exe commands are permanent and are not lost when the computer or the IPv6 protocol is restarted.</p>
<p>The following command is available on WindowsÂ XP with SP1 and later to query and configure IPv6 on a local computer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="netsh-exe.html">Netsh.exe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1), IPv6 configuration and management used several older command-line tools to configure and manage IPv6. Using these older tools, the IPv6 changes are not permanent and are lost when the computer or the IPv6 protocol was restarted.</p>
<p>The following older commands are available on WindowsÂ XP</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="net-exe-2.html">Net.exe</a></li>
<li><a href="ipv6-exe-2.html">Ipv6.exe</a></li>
<li><a href="ipsec6-exe-2.html">Ipsec6.exe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These older tools were also provided in the IPv6 Technology Preview for Windows 2000</p>
<p>Configuration changes using these older tools could be maintained by placing them as command lines in a command script file (.cmd) that is run after restarting the computer or the IPv6 protocol. To reinstate configuration changes automatically after restarting, is was possible to use the Windows Scheduled Tasks to run the .cmd file when the computer starts.</p>
<p>These older tools are not provided on Windows ServerÂ 2003 and later. The &quot;netsh interface ipv6&quot; tool is provided for configuring and managing IPv6 from the command-line on Windows ServerÂ 2003 and later.</p>

<h1>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION Control Code</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> control code associates a socket with a persistent or runtime reservation for a block of TCP or UDP identified by the port reservation token.
This IOCTL must be issued before the socket is bound.
If and when the socket is bound, the port assigned to it will be selected from the port reservation identified by the given token.
If no ports are available from the specified reservation, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-bind"><strong>bind</strong></a> function call will fail.</p>
<p>To perform this operation, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function with the following parameters.</p>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>int WSAIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION, // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,  // pointer to an INET_PORT_RESERVATION_TOKEN
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,    // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  NULL,           // lpvOutBuffer is a pointer to the output buffer
  0,              // cbOutBuffer is the size, in bytes, of the output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
);
</code></pre>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>int WSPIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION, // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,  // pointer to an INET_PORT_RESERVATION_TOKEN
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,    // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  NULL,           // lpvOutBuffer is a pointer to the output buffer
  0,              // cbOutBuffer is the size, in bytes, of the output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
  (LPWSATHREADID) lpThreadId,   // a WSATHREADID structure
  (LPINT) lpErrno   // a pointer to the error code.
);
</code></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>s</h3>
<p>A descriptor identifying a socket.</p>
<h3>dwIoControlCode</h3>
<p>The control code for the operation.
Use <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> for this operation.</p>
<h3>lpvInBuffer</h3>
<p>A pointer to the input buffer.
This parameter contains a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-inet_port_reservation_token"><strong>INET_PORT_RESERVATION_TOKEN</strong></a> structure with the token for the TCP or UDP port reservation to associate with the socket.</p>
<h3>cbInBuffer</h3>
<p>The size, in bytes, of the input buffer.
This parameter must be at least the size of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-inet_port_reservation_token"><strong>INET_PORT_RESERVATION_TOKEN</strong></a> structure.</p>
<h3>lpvOutBuffer</h3>
<p>A pointer to the output buffer.
This parameter is unused for this operation.</p>
<h3>cbOutBuffer</h3>
<p>The size, in bytes, of the output buffer.
This parameter must be set to zero.</p>
<h3>lpcbBytesReturned</h3>
<p>A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data stored in the output buffer.</p>
<p>If the output buffer is too small, the call fails, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror"><strong>WSAGetLastError</strong></a> returns <a href="windows-sockets-error-codes-2.html"><strong>WSAEINVAL</strong></a>, and the <em>lpcbBytesReturned</em> parameter points to a <strong>DWORD</strong> value of zero.</p>
<p>If <em>lpOverlapped</em> is <strong>NULL</strong>, the <strong>DWORD</strong> value pointed to by the <em>lpcbBytesReturned</em> parameter that is returned on a successful call cannot be zero.</p>
<p>If the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is not <strong>NULL</strong> for overlapped sockets, operations that cannot be completed immediately will be initiated, and completion will be indicated at a later time.
The <strong>DWORD</strong> value pointed to by the <em>lpcbBytesReturned</em> parameter that is returned may be zero since the size of the data stored can't be determined until the overlapped operation has completed.
The final completion status can be retrieved when the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has completed.</p>
<h3>lpvOverlapped</h3>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped"><strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>If socket <em>s</em> was created without the overlapped attribute, the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is ignored.</p>
<p>If <em>s</em> was opened with the overlapped attribute and the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is not <strong>NULL</strong>, the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation.
In this case, <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter must point to a valid <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped"><strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>For overlapped operations, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns immediately, and the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has been completed.
Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.</p>
<h3>lpCompletionRoutine</h3>
<p>Type: _In_opt_ <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nc-winsock2-lpwsaoverlapped_completion_routine"><strong>LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE</strong></a></p>
<p>A pointer to the completion routine called when the operation has been completed (ignored for non-overlapped sockets).</p>
<h3>lpThreadId</h3>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid"><strong>WSATHREADID</strong></a> structure to be used by the provider in a subsequent call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc"><strong>WPUQueueApc</strong></a>.
The provider should store the referenced <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid"><strong>WSATHREADID</strong></a> structure (not the pointer to same) until after the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc"><strong>WPUQueueApc</strong></a> function returns.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  This parameter applies only to the <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function.</p>
<h3>lpErrno</h3>
<p>A pointer to the error code.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  This parameter applies only to the <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function.</p>
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>If the operation completes successfully, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns zero.</p>
<p>If the operation fails or is pending, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns <strong>SOCKET_ERROR</strong>.
To get extended error information, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror"><strong>WSAGetLastError</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL is supported on Windows Vista and later versions of the operating system.</p>
<p>Applications and services which need to reserve ports fall into two categories.
The first category includes components which need a particular port as part of their operation.
Such components will generally prefer to specify their required port at installation time (in an application manifest, for example).
The second category includes components which need any available port or block of ports at runtime.
These two categories correspond to specific and wildcard port reservation requests.
Specific reservation requests may be persistent or runtime, while wildcard port reservation requests are only supported at runtime.</p>
<p>The <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL is used to associate a TCP or UDP port reservation with either a persistent or runtime reservation.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-createpersistenttcpportreservation"><strong>CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-createpersistentudpportreservation"><strong>CreatePersistentUdpPortReservation</strong></a> function provides the ability for an application or service to reserve a persistent block of TCP or UDP ports.
Persistent port reservations are recorded in a persistent store for the TCP or UDP module in Windows.
Note that the token for a given persistent port reservation may change each time the system is restarted.</p>
<p>Once a persistent TCP or UDP port reservation has been obtained, an application can request port assignments from the port reservation by opening a TCP or UDP socket, then calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> function specifying the <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL and passing the reservation token before issuing a call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-bind"><strong>bind</strong></a> function on the socket.</p>
<p>The <a href="sio-acquire-port-reservation.html"><strong>SIO_ACQUIRE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong></a> IOCTL can be used to request a runtime reservation for a block of TCP or UDP ports.
For runtime port reservations, the port pool requires that reservations be consumed from the process on whose socket the reservation was granted.
Runtime port reservations last only as long as the lifetime of the socket on which the <a href="sio-acquire-port-reservation.html"><strong>SIO_ACQUIRE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong></a> IOCTL was called.
In contrast, persistent port reservations created using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-createpersistenttcpportreservation"><strong>CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iphlpapi/nf-iphlpapi-createpersistentudpportreservation"><strong>CreatePersistentUdpPortReservation</strong></a> function may be consumed by any process with the ability to obtain persistent reservations.</p>
<p>Once a runtime TCP or UDP port reservation has been obtained, an application can request port assignments from the port reservation by opening a TCP or UDP socket, then calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> function specifying the <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL and passing the reservation token before issuing a call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-bind"><strong>bind</strong></a> function on the socket.</p>
<p>If both <em>lpOverlapped</em> and <em>lpCompletionRoutine</em> parameters are NULL, the socket in this function will be treated as a non-overlapped socket.
For a non-overlapped socket, <em>lpOverlapped</em> and <em>lpCompletionRoutine</em> parameters are ignored, except that the function can block if socket <em>s</em> is in blocking mode.
If socket <em>s</em> is in non-blocking mode, this function will still block since this particular IOCTL does not support non-blocking mode.</p>
<p>For overlapped sockets, operations that cannot be completed immediately will be initiated, and completion will be indicated at a later time.</p>
<p>Any IOCTL may block indefinitely, depending on the service provider's implementation.
If the application cannot tolerate blocking in a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function call, overlapped I/O would be advised for IOCTLs that are especially likely to block.</p>
<p>The <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL can fail with <strong>WSAEINTR</strong> or <strong>WSA_OPERATION_ABORTED</strong> under the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The request is canceled by the I/O Manager.</li>
<li>The socket is closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL passed to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function for a persistent port reservation can only be used in an application when the user is logged on as a member of the Administrators group.
If <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL is used in an application when the user is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and <strong>WSAEACCES</strong> is returned.
The use of the <strong>SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION</strong> IOCTL can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later.
If an application that uses this IOCTL with a persistent port reservation is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a <strong>requestedExecutionLevel</strong> set to <em>requireAdministrator</em>.
If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (<code>RunAs administrator</code>) for this function to succeed.</p>

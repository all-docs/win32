<h1>Error Reporting and Parameter Validation</h1>
<p>The scheme for error reporting differs between the SPI and API interfaces. Windows Sockets service providers report errors along with the function returning, as opposed to the per-thread based approach utilized in the API. The Ws2_32.dll uses the service provider's per-function error code to update the per-thread error value that is obtained through the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror"><strong>WSAGetLastError</strong></a> API function. Service providers are still required, however, to maintain the per-socket based error which can be retrieved through the SO_ERROR socket option.</p>
<p>The Ws2_32.dll performs parameter validation only on function calls that are implemented entirely within itself. Service providers are responsible for performing all of their own parameter validation.</p>

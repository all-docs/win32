<h1>Future Improvements</h1>
<p>There are several improvements that can be made to this application, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single, persistent connection could be created by the application. Appropriate error handling would have to be added. This would reduce the overhead associated with connection startup and teardown.</li>
<li>The reply code on the server could be optimized to consolidate replies, reducing the number of packets sent from the server.</li>
<li>Improvements in the protocol could be made. For example, an update bitmask could be used to signify which cells are to be updated, and only that cell data sent.</li>
<li>Updates could be overlapped using different threads, so that the network is not idle while the <strong>ComputeNext</strong> function is running.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Summary of Overlapped Completion Indication Mechanisms in the SPI</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the completion semantics for an overlapped socket, showing the various combination of <em>lpOverlapped</em>, <strong>hEvent</strong>, and <em>lpCompletionRoutine</em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>lpOverlapped</em></th>
<th><strong>hEvent</strong></th>
<th><em>lpCompletionRoutine</em></th>
<th>Completion indication</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>Not applicable</td>
<td>Ignored</td>
<td>Operation completes synchronously, that is, it behaves as if it were a nonoverlapped socket.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>not NULL</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>Operation completes overlapped, but there is no Windows Sockets 2-supported completion mechanism. The completion port mechanism (if supported) may be used in this case, otherwise there will be no completion notification.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>not NULL</td>
<td>not NULL</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>Operation completes overlapped, notification by signaling event object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>not NULL</td>
<td>Ignored</td>
<td>not NULL</td>
<td>Operation completes overlapped, notification by scheduling completion routine.</td>

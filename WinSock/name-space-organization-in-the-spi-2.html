<h1>Namespace Organization in the SPI</h1>
<p>Many namespaces are arranged hierarchically. Some, such as X.500 and NDS, allow unlimited nesting. Others allow services to be combined into a single level of hierarchy or group. This is typically referred to as a workgroup. When constructing a query, it is often necessary to establish a context point within a namespace hierarchy from which the search will begin.</p>

<h1>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE Control Code</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> control code notifies an application when the ideal send backlog (ISB) value changes for the connection.</p>
<p>To perform this operation, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function with the following parameters.</p>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>int WSAIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE, // dwIoControlCode
  NULL,                         // lpvInBuffer
  0,                            // cbInBuffer
  NULL,         // output buffer
  0,       // size of output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
);
</code></pre>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>int WSPIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE, // dwIoControlCode
  NULL,                         // lpvInBuffer
  0,                            // cbInBuffer
  NULL,         // output buffer
  0,       // size of output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
  (LPWSATHREADID) lpThreadId,   // a WSATHREADID structure
  (LPINT) lpErrno   // a pointer to the error code.
);
</code></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>s</h3>
<p>A descriptor identifying a socket.</p>
<h3>dwIoControlCode</h3>
<p>The control code for the operation.
Use <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> for this operation.</p>
<h3>lpvInBuffer</h3>
<p>A pointer to the input buffer.
This parameter is unused for this operation.</p>
<h3>cbInBuffer</h3>
<p>The size, in bytes, of the input buffer.This parameter is unused for this operation.</p>
<h3>lpvOutBuffer</h3>
<p>A pointer to the output buffer.
This parameter is unused for this operation.</p>
<h3>cbOutBuffer</h3>
<p>The size, in bytes, of the output buffer.
This parameter must be set to zero.</p>
<h3>lpcbBytesReturned</h3>
<p>A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data stored in the output buffer.
This returned parameter points to a <strong>DWORD</strong> value of zero for this operation, since there is no output.</p>
<h3>lpvOverlapped</h3>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped"><strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>If socket <em>s</em> was created without the overlapped attribute, the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is ignored.</p>
<p>If <em>s</em> was opened with the overlapped attribute and the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is not <strong>NULL</strong>, the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation.
In this case, <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter must point to a valid <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped"><strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>For overlapped operations, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns immediately, and the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has been completed.
Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.</p>
<h3>lpCompletionRoutine</h3>
<p>Type: _In_opt_ <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nc-winsock2-lpwsaoverlapped_completion_routine"><strong>LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE</strong></a></p>
<p>A pointer to the completion routine called when the operation has been completed (ignored for non-overlapped sockets).</p>
<h3>lpThreadId</h3>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid"><strong>WSATHREADID</strong></a> structure to be used by the provider in a subsequent call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc"><strong>WPUQueueApc</strong></a>.
The provider should store the referenced <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid"><strong>WSATHREADID</strong></a> structure (not the pointer to same) until after the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc"><strong>WPUQueueApc</strong></a> function returns.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  This parameter applies only to the <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function.</p>
<h3>lpErrno</h3>
<p>A pointer to the error code.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  This parameter applies only to the <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function.</p>
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>If the operation completes successfully, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns zero.</p>
<p>If the operation fails or is pending, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns <strong>SOCKET_ERROR</strong>.
To get extended error information, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror"><strong>WSAGetLastError</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL is supported on Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 (SP1), and later versions of the operating system.</p>
<p>When sending data over a TCP connection using Windows sockets, it is important to keep a sufficient amount of data outstanding (sent but not acknowledged yet) in TCP in order to achieve the highest throughput.
The ideal value for the amount of data outstanding to achieve the best throughput for the TCP connection is called the ideal send backlog (ISB) size.
The ISB value is a function of the bandwidth-delay product of the TCP connection and the receiver's advertised receive window (and partly the amount of congestion in the network).</p>
<p>The ISB value per connection is available from the TCP protocol implementation in Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista with SP1, and later versions of the operating system.
The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL can be used by an application to get a notification when the ISB value changes dynamically for a connection.</p>
<p>On Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista with SP1, and later versions of the operating system, the <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> and <a href="sio-ideal-send-backlog-query.html"><strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_QUERY</strong></a> IOCTLs are supported on stream-oriented sockets that are in a connected state.</p>
<p>The range for the ISB value for a TCP connection can theoretically vary from 0 to a maximum of 16 megabytes.</p>
<p>See the <a href="sio-ideal-send-backlog-query.html"><strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_QUERY</strong></a> IOCTL reference page for typical usage of the ISB mechanism for achieving better throughput over high bandwidth-delay product connections.</p>
<p>The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL is allowed only on a stream socket that is in the connected state.
Otherwise the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function will fail with <strong>WSAENOTCONN</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL uses no input or output buffers and pends or blocks until an ISB change occurs on the underlying connection.
When this IOCTL is completed, a Winsock application can use the <a href="sio-ideal-send-backlog-query.html"><strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_QUERY</strong></a> IOCTL to retrieve the new ISB value on the connection.</p>
<p>The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL does not support non-blocking mode.
An application is allowed to issue this IOCTL on a non-blocking socket, but the IOCTL will simply block or pend until the ISB value changes.</p>
<p>If both <em>lpOverlapped</em> and <em>lpCompletionRoutine</em> parameters are NULL, the socket in this function will be treated as a non-overlapped socket.
For a non-overlapped socket, <em>lpOverlapped</em> and <em>lpCompletionRoutine</em> parameters are ignored, except that the function can block if socket <em>s</em> is in blocking mode.
If socket <em>s</em> is in non-blocking mode, this function will still block since this particular IOCTL does not support non-blocking mode.</p>
<p>For overlapped sockets, operations that cannot be completed immediately will be initiated, and completion will be indicated at a later time.</p>
<p>Any IOCTL may block indefinitely, depending on the service provider's implementation.
If the application cannot tolerate blocking in a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function call, overlapped I/O would be advised for IOCTLs that are especially likely to block.</p>
<p>The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL provides a notification and is expected to block or pend until the ISB value changes.
So it would commonly be called asynchronously with the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter set to a valid WSAOVERLAPPED structure.</p>
<p>The <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL can fail with <strong>WSAEINTR</strong> or <strong>WSA_OPERATION_ABORTED</strong> under the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TCP connection is gracefully disconnected in the send direction. This can occur as a result of a call to shutdown function with the how parameter set to <strong>SD_SEND</strong>, a call to the <strong>DisconnectEx</strong> function, or a call to the <strong>TransmitFile</strong> or <strong>TransmitPackets</strong> function with <em>dwFlags</em> parameter set to <strong>TF_DISCONNECT</strong> or <strong>TF_REUSE</strong>.</li>
<li>The TCP connection has been reset or aborted.</li>
<li>The application issues a <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL when there is already a pended notification request. Only one pended <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> request is allowed at a time.</li>
<li>The request is canceled by the I/O Manager.</li>
<li>The socket is closed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two inline wrapper functions for these IOCTLs are defined in the <em>Ws2tcpip.h</em> header file.
It is recommended that these inline functions be used instead of using the <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> and <a href="sio-ideal-send-backlog-query.html"><strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_QUERY</strong></a> IOCTLs directly.</p>
<p>The inline wrapper function for the <strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_CHANGE</strong> IOCTL is the <strong>idealsendbacklognotify</strong> function.</p>
<p>The inline wrapper function for the <a href="sio-ideal-send-backlog-query.html"><strong>SIO_IDEAL_SEND_BACKLOG_QUERY</strong></a> IOCTL is the <strong>idealsendbacklogquery</strong> function.</p>

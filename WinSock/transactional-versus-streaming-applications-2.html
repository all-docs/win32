<h1>Transactional versus Streaming Applications</h1>
<p>There are two fundamental types of network applications: <em>transactional</em> and <em>streaming</em>. These application types are also called <em>interactive</em> and <em>batch processing</em> application types, respectively.</p>
<p>Transactional applications are stop-and-go applications. They usually perform request/reply operations, often ordered. Examples of transactional applications include synchronous remote procedure call (RPC), as well as some HTTP and Domain Name System (DNS) implementations.</p>
<p>Streaming applications move data. To describe streaming applications with a parallel term, streaming applications adhere to a pedal-to-the-metal data transmission philosophy, usually with little concern for data ordering. Examples of streaming applications include network backup and file transfer protocol (FTP).</p>
<p>Once the application type is determined, its network and protocol characteristics are determined as well.</p>

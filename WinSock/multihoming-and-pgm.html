<h1>Multihoming and PGM</h1>
<p>Special consideration must be given to multihomed PGM senders or receivers. This page describes the considerations, and provides guidelines for best programming practices.</p>
<h2>Multihomed PGM Sender</h2>
<p>When an application fails to specify an interface upon calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect"><strong>connect</strong></a> function, the first available interface is used. If no interface is available, <strong>connect</strong> fails.</p>
<p>When an application specifies an interface using the <a href="socket-options.html">RM_SET_SEND_IF</a> socket option, a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-bind"><strong>bind</strong></a> attempt is made implicitly to that interface using TCP/IP, and fails if TCP/IP fails the bind request. If the interface is set using RM_SET_SEND_IF multiple times, only the last interface set successfully is applicable.</p>
<p>Windows Sockets maintains which interface is set, and if that interface disappears, the session is disconnected.</p>
<h2>Multihomed PGM Receiver</h2>
<p>When an application fails to specify an interface upon calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-listen"><strong>listen</strong></a> function, the default interface is used. If no interface is available, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-bind"><strong>bind</strong></a> fails.</p>
<p>When an application specifies one or more interfaces on which to listen, using <a href="socket-options.html">RM_ADD_RECEIVE_IF</a>, Windows Sockets attempts to bind to the requested interface or interfaces using TCP/IP. Any error from TCP/IP causes this request to fail. Unlike the PGM sender case, adding a receive interface multiple times result in the listens being posted on all the successfully added interfaces. Use the RM_DEL_RECEIVE_IF socket option to stop listening on an interface.</p>
<p>Windows Sockets does not maintain state about multiple specified listening interfaces, and instead relies on TCP/IP to do so. Once a session is in progress, however, Windows Sockets track the incoming interface for that session, and if that interface disappears, Windows Sockets disconnects the session.</p>

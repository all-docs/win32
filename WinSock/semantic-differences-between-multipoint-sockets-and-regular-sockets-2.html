<h1>Semantic differences between multipoint sockets and regular sockets</h1>
<p>In the control plane, there are some significant semantic differences between a c_root socket and a regular point-to-point socket:</p>
<ul>
<li>The c_root socket can be used in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> to join a new a leaf.</li>
<li>Placing a c_root socket into listening mode (by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-listen"><strong>listen</strong></a>) does not preclude the c_root socket from being used in a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> to add a new leaf, or for sending and receiving multipoint data.</li>
<li>The closing of a c_root socket causes all of the associated c_leaf sockets to get FD_CLOSE notification.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no semantic differences between a c_leaf socket and a regular socket in the control plane, except that the c_leaf socket can be used in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a>, and the use of c_leaf socket in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-listen"><strong>listen</strong></a> indicates that only multipoint connection requests should be accepted.</p>
<p>In the data plane, the semantic differences between the d_root socket and a regular point-to-point socket are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data sent on the d_root socket is delivered to all the leaves in the same multipoint session.</li>
<li>The data received on the d_root socket may be from any of the leaves.</li>
</ul>
<p>The d_leaf socket in the rooted data plane has no semantic difference from the regular socket, however, in the nonrooted data plane, the data sent on the d_leaf socket goes to all the other leaf nodes, and the data received could be from any other leaf nodes. As mentioned earlier, the information about whether the d_leaf socket is in a rooted or nonrooted data plane is contained in the corresponding <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa"><strong>WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</strong></a> structure for the socket.</p>

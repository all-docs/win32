<h1>Using WSAJoinLeaf</h1>
<p>As mentioned previously, the function <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> is used to join a leaf node into a multipoint session. <strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong> has the same parameters and semantics as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaconnect"><strong>WSAConnect</strong></a> except that it returns a socket descriptor (as in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaaccept"><strong>WSAAccept</strong></a>), and it has an additional <em>dwFlags</em> parameter.</p>
<p>The <em>dwFlags</em> parameter is used to indicate whether the socket will be acting only as a sender, only as a receiver, or both. Only multipoint sockets may be used for input parameter <em>s</em> in this function. If the multipoint socket is in nonblocking mode, the returned socket descriptor is not usable until after a corresponding FD_CONNECT indication is received. A root application in a multipoint session may call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> one or more times in order to add a number of leaf nodes, however at most one multipoint connection request may be outstanding at a time.</p>
<p>The socket descriptor returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> differs depending on whether the input socket descriptor, <em>s</em>, is a c_root or a c_leaf. When used with a c_root socket, the <em>name</em> parameter designates a particular leaf node to be added and the returned socket descriptor is a c_leaf socket corresponding to the newly added leaf node. It is not intended to be used for the exchange of multipoint data, but rather it is used to receive FD_XXX indications (for example, FD_CLOSE) for the connection that exists to the particular c_leaf. Some multipoint implementations may also allow this socket to be used for side chats between the root and an individual leaf node. An FD_CLOSE indication is received for this socket if the corresponding leaf node calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-closesocket"><strong>closesocket</strong></a> to drop out of the multipoint session. Symmetrically, invoking <strong>closesocket</strong> on the c_leaf socket returned from <strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong> causes the socket in the corresponding leaf node to get an FD_CLOSE notification.</p>
<p>When <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> is invoked with a c_leaf socket, the <em>name</em> parameter contains the address of the root application (for a rooted control scheme) or an existing multipoint session (nonrooted control scheme), and the returned socket descriptor is the same as the input socket descriptor. In a rooted control scheme, the root application puts its c_root socket in listening mode by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-listen"><strong>listen</strong></a>. The standard FD_ACCEPT notification is delivered when the leaf node requests to join itself to the multipoint session. The root application uses the usual <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-accept"><strong>accept</strong></a>/<a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaaccept"><strong>WSAAccept</strong></a> functions to admit the new leaf node. The value returned from either <strong>accept</strong> or <strong>WSAAccept</strong> is also a c_leaf socket descriptor just like those returned from <strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong>. To accommodate multipoint schemes that allow both root-initiated and leaf-initiated joins, it is acceptable for a c_root socket that is already in listening mode to be used as input to <strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong>.</p>
<p>A multipoint root application is generally responsible for the orderly dismantling of a multipoint session. Such an application may use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-shutdown"><strong>shutdown</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-closesocket"><strong>closesocket</strong></a> on a c_root socket to cause all of the associated c_leaf sockets, including those returned from <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> and their corresponding c_leaf sockets in the remote leaf nodes, to get FD_CLOSE notification.</p>

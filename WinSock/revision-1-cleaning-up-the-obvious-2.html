<h1>Revision One: Cleaning up the Obvious</h1>
<p>In this version of the example program, a few obvious changes have been made that will take initial strides at improving performance. This version of the code is far from performance-tuned, but it is a good incremental step that enables examination of the effects of incrementally better approaches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
This example of the application provides intentionally poor performance, in order to illustrate performance improvements possible with changes to code. Do not use this code sample in your application; it is for illustration purposes only.</p>

<pre lang="C++"><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

BYTE Set(row, col, bAlive)
{
    SOCKET s = socket(...);
    BYTE byRet = 0;
    BYTE tmp[3];
    tmp[0] = (BYTE)row;
    tmp[1] = (BYTE)col;
    tmp[2] = (BYTE)bAlive;
    bind( s, ... );
    connect( s, ... );
    send( s, &amp;tmp, 3 );
    recv( s, &amp;byRet, 1 );
    closesocket( s );
    return byRet;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Changes in this Version</h2>
<p>This version reflects the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed SNDBUF=0. The 200 millisecond delays due to unbuffered sends and delayed acknowledgments are removed.</li>
<li>Removed the Send-Send-Receive behavior. This change eliminates 200-millisecond delays due to Nagle and delayed ACK interactions.</li>
<li>Removed little-endian assumption. The bytes are now in order.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remaining Problems</h2>
<p>In this version, the following problems remain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application is still connect heavy. Since the 600+ millisecond delays are removed, the application now hits the 12 connects-per-second sustained rate. Many concurrent connections now becomes an issue.</li>
<li>The application is still fat; unchanged cells are still propagated to the server.</li>
<li>The application still exhibits poor streaming; 3-byte sends are still small sends.</li>
<li>The application now sends 2 bytes/RTT, which equals 4 KB/s on directly connected Ethernet. This is not too fast, but TIME-WAIT will likely cause problems first.</li>
<li>The overhead is down to 99.3%, which is still not a good overhead percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Performance Metrics</h2>
<p>The following key performance metrics are expressed in Round Trip Time (RTT), Goodput, and Protocol Overhead. See the <a href="network-terminology-2.html">Network Terminology</a> topic for an explanation of these terms.</p>
<p>This version reflect the following performance metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cell Timeâ€”2Ã—RTT</li>
<li>Goodputâ€”2 bytes/RTT</li>
<li>Protocol Overheadâ€”99.3 percent</li>
</ul>

<h1>Notification from NLA</h1>
<p>NLA is capable of providing its clients with notification of network location changes. The mechanism used to request notification of change events is a combination of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina"><strong>WSALookupServiceBegin</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsanspioctl"><strong>WSANSPIoctl</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta"><strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong></a> functions.</p>
<p>In order to receive change notification from NLA, a client must first call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina"><strong>WSALookupServiceBegin</strong></a> to obtain a valid NLA SP lookup handle. Next, the client can call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta"><strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsanspioctl"><strong>WSANSPIoctl</strong></a> in any order; to register for notification, call the <strong>WSANSPIoctl</strong> function with the SIO_NSP_NOTIFY_CHANGE control code set in the <em>dwControlCode</em> parameter.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta"><strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong></a> function returns WSA_E_NO_MORE as a set delimiter. When a client has registered for notification using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsanspioctl"><strong>WSANSPIoctl</strong></a> function and <strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong> returns WSA_E_NO_MORE, calling <strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong> again reveals whether a change has occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If no changes have occurred since the previous WSA_E_NO_MORE, WSA_E_NO_MORE is returned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a change has occurred, or if a change has occurred and a polling call is made, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicenexta"><strong>WSALookupServiceNext</strong></a> function call returns networks as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw"><strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong></a> structures, with one of the following flags set in its <strong>dwOutputFlags</strong> member:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
</ul>
<p>Change notification is provided for any fields that changed since the NLA lookup handle was obtained with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupservicebegina"><strong>WSALookupServiceBegin</strong></a> function call, or since the last enumeration that resulted in the WSA_E_NO_MORE error. When all changed network location information is provided, WSA_E_NO_MORE is returned. Clients can reissue a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsanspioctl"><strong>WSANSPIoctl</strong></a> function call on the same query handle at any time, one at a time, with the SIO_NSP_NOTIFY_CHANGE flag set. This capability enables a client to recycle the query handle on an ongoing basis, thereby relieving the client from having to maintain change-state information on its own. Once a client no longer needs change notifications, it should close the query handle using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsalookupserviceend"><strong>WSALookupServiceEnd</strong></a> function.</p>

<h1>ATM Point to Multipoint</h1>
<p>ATM falls into the category of rooted data and rooted control planes. An application acting as the root would create c_root sockets and counterparts running on leaf nodes would utilize c_leaf sockets. The root application uses <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> to add new leaf nodes. The corresponding applications on the leaf nodes will have set their c_leaf sockets into listen mode. <strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong> with a c_root socket specified is mapped to the Q.2931 ADDPARTY message. The leaf-initiated join is not supported in ATM UNI 3.1, but is supported in ATM UNI 4.0. Thus <strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong> with a c_leaf socket specified is mapped to the appropriate ATM UNI 4.0 message.</p>
<p>There are additional considerations to bear in mind for ATM point-to-multipoint:</p>
<ul>
<li>The addition of new leaves to the ATM point-to-multipoint session is invitation-based only. The root invites leaves â€” which have already their <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-accept"><strong>accept</strong></a> function call â€” by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsajoinleaf"><strong>WSAJoinLeaf</strong></a> function.</li>
<li>The flow of data in an ATM point-to-multipoint session is from root-to-leaves only; leaves cannot use the same session to send information to the root.</li>
<li>Only one leaf per ATM adapter is allowed.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Multiple Provider Restrictions on Select</h1>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-select"><strong>select</strong></a> function is used to determine the status of one or more sockets in a set. For each socket, the caller can request information on read, write, or error status. A set of sockets is indicated by an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-fd_set"><strong>fd_set</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>Windows Sockets 2 allows an application to use more than one service provider, but the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-select"><strong>select</strong></a> function is limited to a set of sockets associated with a single service provider. This does not in any way restrict an application from having multiple sockets open through multiple providers.</p>
<p>There are two ways to determine the status of a set of sockets that spans more than one service provider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsawaitformultipleevents"><strong>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect"><strong>WSAEventSelect</strong></a> functions when blocking semantics are employed.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsaasyncselect"><strong>WSAAsyncSelect</strong></a> function when nonblocking operations are employed and the application is already using a Windows message pump.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an application needs to use blocking semantics on a set of sockets that spans multiple providers, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsawaitformultipleevents"><strong>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</strong></a> is recommended. The application can also use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect"><strong>WSAEventSelect</strong></a> function, which allows the FD_XXX network events (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect"><strong>WSAEventSelect</strong></a>) to associate with an event object and be handled from within the event object paradigm (described in <a href="overlapped-i-o-and-event-objects-2.html">Overlapped I/O and Event Objects</a>).</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsaasyncselect"><strong>WSAAsyncSelect</strong></a> function is not restricted to a single provider because it takes a single socket descriptor as an input parameter. Note however, that <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect"><strong>WSAEventSelect</strong></a> function offers better performance and scalability over <strong>WSAAsyncSelect</strong> as the overhead of maintaining the message pump with Winsock event messages increases as the total number of sockets being used increases.</p>

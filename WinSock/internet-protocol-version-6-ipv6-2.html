<h1>Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)</h1>
<p>It is important to ensure that new Winsock applications as well as existing applications are fully compatible with IPv6. The availability of the IPv4 address space for new IPv4 address allocations was exhausted for Asia and the Pacific in 2011. Other parts of the world are expected to be exhausted in a few years.</p>
<p>A growing percentage of new websites and services are available using IPv6 addresses. Many Internet users in emerging markets are dependent on IPv6 for Internet access.</p>
<p>Microsoft has a long commitment of supporting IPv6. Full IPv6 support is provided on WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1) and later.</p>

<h1>Raw Sockets</h1>
<p>A raw socket is a type of socket that allows access to the underlying transport provider. The use of raw sockets when porting applications to Winsock is not recommended for several reasons.</p>
<p>The Windows Sockets specification does not mandate that a Winsock service provider support raw sockets, that is, sockets of type <strong>SOCK_RAW</strong>. However, service providers are encouraged to supply raw socket support. A Windows Sockets-compliant application that wishes to use raw sockets should attempt to open the socket with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-socket"><strong>socket</strong></a> call, and if it fails either attempt to use another socket type or indicate the failure to the user.</p>
<p>On WindowsÂ 7, Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 2 (SP2), the ability to send traffic over raw sockets has been restricted in several ways. For more information, see <a href="tcp-ip-raw-sockets-2.html">TCP/IP Raw Sockets</a>.</p>

<h1>Default State for a Socket's Overlapped Attribute</h1>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-socket"><strong>socket</strong></a> function created sockets with the overlapped attribute set by default in the first Wsock32.dll, the 32-bit version of Windows Sockets 1.1. In order to ensure backward compatibility with currently deployed Wsock32.dll implementations, this will continue to be the case for Windows Sockets 2 as well. That is, in Windows Sockets 2 sockets created with the <strong>socket</strong> function will have the overlapped attribute. However, in order to be more compatible with the rest of the Windows API, sockets created with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsasocketa"><strong>WSASocket</strong></a> will not, default, have the overlapped attribute. This attribute will only be applied if the WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED bit is set.</p>

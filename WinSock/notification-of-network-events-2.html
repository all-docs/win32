<h1>Notification of Network Events</h1>
<p>One of the most important responsibilities of a data transport service provider is that of providing indications to the client when certain network events have occurred. The list of defined network events consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FD_CONNECT</strong>â€” A connection to a remote host or to a multicast session has been completed.</li>
<li><strong>FD_ACCEPT</strong>â€” A remote host is making a connection request.</li>
<li><strong>FD_READ</strong>â€” Network data has arrived which is available to be read.</li>
<li><strong>FD_WRITE</strong>â€” Space has become available in the service provider's buffers so that additional data may now be sent.</li>
<li><strong>FD_OOB</strong>â€” Out of band data is available to be read.</li>
<li><strong>FD_CLOSE</strong>â€” The remote host has closed down the connection.</li>
<li><strong>FD_QOS</strong>â€” A change has occurred in negotiated QoS levels.</li>
<li><strong>FD_GROUP_QOS</strong>â€” Reserved.</li>
<li><strong>FD_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE</strong>â€” A local interface that should be used to reach the destination specified in <strong>SIO_ROUTING_INTERFACE_CHANGE IOCTL</strong> has changed.</li>
<li><strong>FD_ADDRESS_LIST_CHANGE</strong>â€” The list of local addresses to which application can bind has changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The set of network events enumerated above is sometimes referred to as the <strong>FD_XXX</strong> events. Indication of the occurrence of one or more of such network events may be given in a number of ways depending on how the client requests notification.</p>

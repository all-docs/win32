<h1>Socket I/O</h1>
<p>There are three primary ways of doing I/O in Windows Sockets 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking I/O.</li>
<li>Nonblocking I/O along with asynchronous notification of network events.</li>
<li>Overlapped I/O with completion indication.</li>
</ul>
<p>We describe each method in the following sections. Blocking I/O is the default behavior, nonblocking mode can be used on any socket that is placed into nonblocking mode, and overlapped I/O can only occur on sockets that are created with the overlapped attribute. It is also interesting to note that the two calls for sending: <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566316(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPSend</strong></a> and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742291(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPSendTo</strong></a> and the two calls for receiving: <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566309(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPRecv</strong></a> and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742287(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPRecvFrom</strong></a> each implement all three methods of I/O. Service providers determine how to perform the I/O operation based on socket modes, attributes, and the input parameter values.</p>

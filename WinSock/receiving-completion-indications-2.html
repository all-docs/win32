<h1>Receiving Completion Indications</h1>
<p>Several options are available for receiving completion indications, thus providing applications with appropriate levels of flexibility. These include: waiting (or blocking) on event objects, polling event objects, and socket I/O completion routines.</p>
<h2>Blocking and Waiting for Completion Indication</h2>
<p>Applications can block while waiting for one or more event objects to become set using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsawaitformultipleevents"><strong>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</strong></a> function. In Windows implementations, the process or thread truly blocks. Since Windows Sockets 2 event objects are implemented as Windows events, the native Windows function, <a href="/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitformultipleobjects"><strong>WaitForMultipleObjects</strong></a> can also be used for this purpose. This is especially useful if the thread needs to wait on both socket and nonsocket events.</p>
<h2>Polling for Completion Indication</h2>
<p>Applications that prefer not to block can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsagetoverlappedresult"><strong>WSAGetOverlappedResult</strong></a> function to poll for the completion status associated with any particular event object. This function indicates whether or not the overlapped operation has completed, and if completed, arranges for the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror"><strong>WSAGetLastError</strong></a> function to retrieve the error status of the overlapped operation.</p>
<h2>Using Socket I/O Completion Routines</h2>
<p>The functions used to initiate overlapped I/O ( <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsasend"><strong>WSASend</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsasendto"><strong>WSASendTo</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsarecv"><strong>WSARecv</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsarecvfrom"><strong>WSARecvFrom</strong></a>) all take <em>lpCompletionRoutine</em> as an optional input parameter. This is a pointer to an application-specific function that is called after a successfully initiated overlapped I/O operation completes (successfully or otherwise). The completion routine follows the same rules as stipulated for Windows file I/O completion routines. That is, the completion routine is not invoked until the thread is in an alertable wait state, such as when the function <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsawaitformultipleevents"><strong>WSAWaitForMultipleEvents</strong></a> is invoked with the <code>fAlertable</code> flag set. An application that uses the completion routine option for a particular overlapped I/O request may not use the wait option of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsagetoverlappedresult"><strong>WSAGetOverlappedResult</strong></a> for that same overlapped I/O request.</p>
<p>The transports allow an application to invoke send and receive operations from within the context of the socket I/O completion routine and guarantee that, for a given socket, I/O completion routines will not be nested. This permits time-sensitive data transmissions to occur entirely within a preemptive context.</p>
<h2>Summary of Overlapped Completion Indication Mechanisms</h2>
<p>The particular overlapped I/O completion indication to be used for a given overlapped operation is determined by whether the application supplies a pointer to a completion function, whether a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped"><strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure is referenced, and by the value of the <strong>hEvent</strong> member within the <strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong> structure (if supplied). The following table summarizes the completion semantics for an overlapped socket and shows the various combinations of <em>lpOverlapped</em>, <strong>hEvent</strong>, and <em>lpCompletionRoutine</em>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><em>lpOverlapped</em></th>
<th>hEvent</th>
<th><em>lpCompletionRoutine</em></th>
<th>Completion indication</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>Not applicable</td>

<td>Operation completes synchronously. It behaves as if it were a nonoverlapped socket.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!NULL</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>NULL</td>
<td>Operation completes overlapped, but there is no Windows Sockets 2-supported completion mechanism. The completion port mechanism (if supported) can be used in this case. Otherwise, there is no completion notification.</td>
</tr>

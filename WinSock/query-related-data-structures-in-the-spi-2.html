<h1>Query-Related Data Structures in the SPI</h1>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw"><strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong></a> structure is used to form queries for <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpnsplookupservicebegin"><strong>NSPLookupServiceBegin</strong></a>, and used to deliver query results for <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpnsplookupservicenext"><strong>NSPLookupServiceNext</strong></a>. It is a complex structure because it contains pointers to several other structures, some of which reference still other structures. The relationship between <strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong> and the structures it references is illustrated as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/ovrvw3-2.png" alt="wsaqueryset structures" /></p>
<p>Within the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaquerysetw"><strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong></a> structure, most of the members are self explanatory, but some deserve additional explanation. The <strong>dwSize</strong> will be filled in with sizeof( <strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong>), and can be used by namespace providers to detect and adapt to different versions of the <strong>WSAQUERYSET</strong> structure that may appear.</p>
<p>The <strong>dwOutputFlags</strong> member is used by a namespace provider to provide additional data about query results. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpnsplookupservicenext"><strong>NSPLookupServiceNext</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/ne-winsock2-wsaecomparator"><strong>WSAECOMPARATOR</strong></a> structure referenced by <strong>lpversion</strong> is used for both query constraint and results. For queries, the <strong>dwVersion</strong> member indicates the desired version of the service. The <strong>ecHow</strong> member is an enumerated type which specifies how the comparison will be made. The choices are COMP_EQUALS which requires that an exact match in version occurs, or COMP_NOTLESS which specifies that the service's version number be no less than the value of <strong>dwVersion</strong>.</p>
<p>The interpretation of <strong>dwNameSpace</strong> and <strong>lpNSProviderId</strong> depends upon how the structure is being used and is described further in the individual function descriptions that utilize this structure.</p>
<p>The <strong>lpszContext</strong> member applies to hierarchical namespaces, and specifies the starting point of a query or the location within the hierarchy where the service resides. The general rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A value of <strong>NULL</strong>, blank (&quot;&quot;) will start the search at the default context.</li>
<li>A value of &quot;\&quot; starts the search at the top of the namespace.</li>
<li>Any other value starts the search at the designated point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providers that do not support containment may return an error if anything other than &quot;&quot; or &quot;\&quot; is specified. Providers that support limited containment, such as groups, should accept &quot;&quot;, '\&quot;, or a designated point. Contexts are namespace specific. If <strong>dwNameSpace</strong> is NS_ALL, then only &quot;&quot; or &quot;\&quot; should be passed as the context because these are recognized by all namespaces.</p>
<p>The <strong>lpszQueryString</strong> member is used to supply additional, namespace-specific query information such as a string describing a well-known service and transport protocol name, as in &quot;ftp/tcp&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/ns-winsock2-afprotocols"><strong>AFPROTOCOLS</strong></a> structure referenced by <strong>lpafpProtocols</strong> is used for query purposes only, and supplies a list of protocols to constrain the query. These protocols are represented as (address family, protocol) pairs, because protocol values only have meaning within the context of an address family.</p>
<p>The array of <a href="/windows/win32/api/ws2def/ns-ws2def-csaddr_info"><strong>CSADDR_INFO</strong></a> structure referenced by <strong>lpcsaBuffer</strong> contains all of the information required for either a service to use in establishing a listen, or a client to use in establishing a connection to the service. The <strong>LocalAddr</strong> and <strong>RemoteAddr</strong> members both directly contain a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2def/ns-ws2def-socket_address"><strong>SOCKET_ADDRESS</strong></a> structure. A service would create a socket using the tuple (LocalAddr.lpSockaddr-&gt;sa_family, iSocketType, iProtocol). It would bind the socket to a local address using LocalAddr.lpSockaddr, and LocalAddr.lpSockaddrLength. The client creates its socket with the tuple (RemoteAddr.lpSockaddr-&gt;sa_family, iSocketType, iProtocol), and uses the combination of RemoteAddr.lpSockaddr, and RemoteAddr.lpSockaddrLength when making a remote connection.</p>

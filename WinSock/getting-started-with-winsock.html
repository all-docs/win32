<h1>Getting started with Winsock</h1>
<p>This section is a step-by-step guide to getting started with Windows Sockets programming. It's designed to provide an understanding of basic Winsock functions and data structures, and how they work together.</p>
<p>The client and server application that we use in this topic for illustration is a very basic client and server. More advanced code examples are included in the samples included with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>
<p>The first few steps are the same for both client and server applications.</p>

<h2>Advanced Winsock sample apps</h2>
<p>Several more advanced <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/Win7Samples/netds/winsock">Winsock client and server sample apps</a> are available on GitHub. They're listed here in order from higher to lower performance, and are found in the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>iocp</p>
<p>That folder contains three sample programs that use I/O completion ports. The programs include: a Winsock server, <code>iocpserver</code>, that uses the <a href="/windows/win32/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaaccept"><strong>WSAAccept</strong></a> function; a Winsock server, <code>iocpserverex</code>, that uses the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mswsock/nf-mswsock-acceptex"><strong>AcceptEx</strong></a> function; and a simple multithreaded Winsock client, <code>iocpclient</code>, used to test either of these servers.</p>
<p>The server programs support multiple clients connecting by using TCP/IP, and sending arbitrary-sized data buffers that the server then echoes back to the client. For convenience, a simple client program, <code>iocpclient</code>, was developed to connect and continually send data to the server to stress it using multiple threads. Winsock servers that use I/O completion ports provide the highest performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>overlap</p>
<p>This folder contains a sample server program that uses overlapped I/O. The sample program uses the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mswsock/nf-mswsock-acceptex"><strong>AcceptEx</strong></a> function and overlapped I/O to effectively handle multiple asynchronous connection requests from clients. The server uses the <strong>AcceptEx</strong> function to multiplex different client connections in a single-threaded Win32 application. Using overlapped I/O allows for greater scalability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WSAPoll</p>
<p>This folder contains a basic sample program that demonstrates the use of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsapoll"><strong>WSAPoll</strong></a> function. The combined client and server program are non-blocking, and use the <strong>WSAPoll</strong> function to determine when it's possible to send or receive without blocking. This sample is for illustration, and isn't a high-performance server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>simple</p>
<p>This folder contains three basic sample programs that demonstrate the use of multiple threads by a server. The programs include: a simple TCP/UDP server, <code>simples</code>; a TCP-only server, <code>simples_ioctl</code>, that uses the <a href="/windows/win32/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-select"><strong>select</strong></a> function in a Win32 console application to support multiple client requests; and a client TCP/UDP program, <code>simplec</code>, for testing the servers. The servers demonstrate the use of multiple threads to handle multiple client requests. That method has scalability issues since a separate thread is created for each client request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>accept</p>
<p>This folder contains a basic sample server and client program. The server demonstrates the use of either non-blocking accept using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-select"><strong>select</strong></a> function, or asynchronous accept using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsaasyncselect"><strong>WSAAsyncSelect</strong></a> function. This sample is for illustration, and isn't a high-performance server.</p>
</li>
</ul>

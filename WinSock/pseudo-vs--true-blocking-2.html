<h1>Pseudo-blocking and true blocking</h1>
<p>In 16-bit Windows environments, true blocking isn't supported by the operating system (OS); therefore, a blocking operation that can't be completed immediately is handled as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The service provider initiates the operation, and then enters a loop during which it dispatches any Windows messages (yielding the processor to another thread if necessary).</li>
<li>It then checks for the completion of the Windows Sockets function.</li>
<li>If the function has completed, or if <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742269(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPCancelBlockingCall</strong></a> has been invoked, then the loop is terminated and the blocking function completes with an appropriate result.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what is meant by the term pseudo-blocking, and the loop referred to above is known as the default blocking hook.</p>
</body>

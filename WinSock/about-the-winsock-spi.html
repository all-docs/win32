<h1>About the Winsock SPI</h1>
<p>Winsock provides a Service Provider Interface for creating Winsock services, commonly referred to as the Winsock SPI. Two types of service providers exist: transport providers and namespace providers. Examples of transport providers include protocol stacks such as TCP/IP or IPX/SPX, while an example of a namespace provider would be an interface to the Internet's Domain Naming System (DNS). Separate sections of the service provider interface specification apply to each type of service provider.</p>
<p><a href="transport-service-providers-2.html">Transport</a> and <a href="name-space-service-providers-2.html">namespace</a> service providers must be registered with the Ws2_32.dll at the time they are installed. This registration need only be done once for each provider as the necessary information is retained in persistent storage.</p>

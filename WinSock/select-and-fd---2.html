<h1>Select, fd_set, and FD_XXX Macros</h1>
<p>Since sockets are not represented by the UNIX-style, small, non-negative integer, the implementation of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-select"><strong>select</strong></a> function was changed in Windows Sockets. Each set of sockets is still represented by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-fd_set"><strong>fd_set</strong></a> structure, but instead of being stored as a bitmask, the set is implemented as an array of sockets. To avoid potential problems, applications must adhere to the use of the FD_XXX macros to set (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-fd_set"><strong>FD_SET</strong></a>), initialize (<strong>FD_ZERO</strong>), clear (<strong>FD_CLR</strong>), and check (<strong>FD_ISSET</strong>) the <strong>fd_set</strong> structures.</p>

<h1>Support for Scatter/Gather Input/Output in the SPI</h1>
<p>The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566316(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPSend</strong></a>, <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742291(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPSendTo</strong></a>, <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566309(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPRecv</strong></a>, and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742287(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPRecvFrom</strong></a> routines all take an array of client buffers as input parameters and thus may be used for scatter/gather (or vectored) I/O. This can be very useful in instances where portions of each message being transmitted consist of one or more fixed length header components in addition to a message body. Such header components need not be concatenated into a single contiguous buffer prior to sending. Likewise on receiving, the header components can be automatically split off into separate buffers, leaving the message body pure.</p>
<p>Utilizing lists of buffers instead of a single buffer does not change the boundaries that apply to receive operations. For message-oriented protocols, a receive operation completes whenever a single message has been received, regardless of how many or few of the supplied buffers were used. Likewise for stream-oriented protocols, a receive completes when an unspecified quantity of bytes arrives over the network, not necessarily when all of the supplied buffers are full.</p>

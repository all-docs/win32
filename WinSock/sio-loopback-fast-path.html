<h1>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH Control Code</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> control code configures a TCP socket for lower latency and faster operations on the loopback interface.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>  The <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> is deprecated and is not recommended to be used in your code.</p>
<p>To perform this operation, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function with the following parameters.</p>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>int WSAIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH,                // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,   // pointer to a Boolean value
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,    // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,         // pointer to output buffer
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,       // size of output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
);
</code></pre>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>int WSPIoctl(
  (socket) s,             // descriptor identifying a socket
  SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH,                // dwIoControlCode
  (LPVOID) lpvInBuffer,   // pointer to a Boolean value
  (DWORD) cbInBuffer,           // size, in bytes, of the input buffer
  (LPVOID) lpvOutBuffer,         // pointer to output buffer
  (DWORD) cbOutBuffer,       // size of output buffer
  (LPDWORD) lpcbBytesReturned,    // number of bytes returned
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED) lpOverlapped,   // OVERLAPPED structure
  (LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE) lpCompletionRoutine,  // completion routine
  (LPWSATHREADID) lpThreadId,   // a WSATHREADID structure
  (LPINT) lpErrno   // a pointer to the error code.
);
</code></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<h3>s</h3>
<p>A descriptor identifying a socket.</p>
<h3>dwIoControlCode</h3>
<p>The control code for the operation.
Use <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> for this operation.</p>
<h3>lpvInBuffer</h3>
<p>A pointer to the input buffer.
This parameter contains a pointer to a Boolean value that indicates if the socket should be configured for fast loopback operations.</p>
<h3>cbInBuffer</h3>
<p>The size, in bytes, of the input buffer.</p>
<h3>lpvOutBuffer</h3>
<p>A pointer to the output buffer.
This parameter is unused for this operation.</p>
<h3>cbOutBuffer</h3>
<p>The size, in bytes, of the output buffer.
This parameter must be set to zero.</p>
<h3>lpcbBytesReturned</h3>
<p>A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data stored in the output buffer.</p>
<p>If the output buffer is too small, the call fails, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror"><strong>WSAGetLastError</strong></a> returns <a href="windows-sockets-error-codes-2.html"><strong>WSAEINVAL</strong></a>, and the <em>lpcbBytesReturned</em> parameter points to a <strong>DWORD</strong> value of zero.</p>
<p>If <em>lpOverlapped</em> is <strong>NULL</strong>, the <strong>DWORD</strong> value pointed to by the <em>lpcbBytesReturned</em> parameter that is returned on a successful call cannot be zero.</p>
<p>If the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is not <strong>NULL</strong> for overlapped sockets, operations that cannot be completed immediately will be initiated, and completion will be indicated at a later time.
The <strong>DWORD</strong> value pointed to by the <em>lpcbBytesReturned</em> parameter that is returned may be zero since the size of the data stored can't be determined until the overlapped operation has completed.
The final completion status can be retrieved when the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has completed.</p>
<h3>lpvOverlapped</h3>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped"><strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>If socket <em>s</em> was created without the overlapped attribute, the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is ignored.</p>
<p>If <em>s</em> was opened with the overlapped attribute and the <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter is not <strong>NULL</strong>, the operation is performed as an overlapped (asynchronous) operation.
In this case, <em>lpOverlapped</em> parameter must point to a valid <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaoverlapped"><strong>WSAOVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>For overlapped operations, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns immediately, and the appropriate completion method is signaled when the operation has been completed.
Otherwise, the function does not return until the operation has been completed or an error occurs.</p>
<h3>lpCompletionRoutine</h3>
<p>Type: _In_opt_ <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nc-winsock2-lpwsaoverlapped_completion_routine"><strong>LPWSAOVERLAPPED_COMPLETION_ROUTINE</strong></a></p>
<p>A pointer to the completion routine called when the operation has been completed (ignored for non-overlapped sockets).</p>
<h3>lpThreadId</h3>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid"><strong>WSATHREADID</strong></a> structure to be used by the provider in a subsequent call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc"><strong>WPUQueueApc</strong></a>.
The provider should store the referenced <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/ns-ws2spi-wsathreadid"><strong>WSATHREADID</strong></a> structure (not the pointer to same) until after the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wpuqueueapc"><strong>WPUQueueApc</strong></a> function returns.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  This parameter applies only to the <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function.</p>
<h3>lpErrno</h3>
<p>A pointer to the error code.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  This parameter applies only to the <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function.</p>
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>If the operation completes successfully, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns zero.</p>
<p>If the operation fails or is pending, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaioctl"><strong>WSAIoctl</strong></a> or <strong>WSPIoctl</strong> function returns <strong>SOCKET_ERROR</strong>.
To get extended error information, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsagetlasterror"><strong>WSAGetLastError</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>An application can use the <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> IOCTL to reduce the latency and improve the performance of loopback operations on a TCP socket.
This IOCTL requests that the TCP/IP stack uses a special fast path for loopback operations on this socket.
The <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> IOCTL can be used only with TCP sockets.
This IOCTL must be used on both sides of the loopback session.
The TCP loopback fast path is supported using either the IPv4 or IPv6 loopback interface.</p>
<p>The socket that plans to initiate the connection request must apply this IOCTL before making the connection request.
So the socket used by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-connect"><strong>connect</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mswsock/nc-mswsock-lpfn_connectex"><strong>ConnectEx</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaconnect"><strong>WSAConnect</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaconnectbylist"><strong>WSAConnectByList</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaconnectbynamew"><strong>WSAConnectByName</strong></a> function to initiate the connection must apply this IOCTL to use the fast path for loopback operations.</p>
<p>The socket that is listening for the connection request must apply this IOCTL before accepting the connection.
So the socket used by the listen function must apply this IOCTL so any sockets that are accepted will use the fast path for loopback.
Any sockets returned by the listen function and passed to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-accept"><strong>accept</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-acceptex"><strong>AcceptEx</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaaccept"><strong>WSAAccept</strong></a> function will be marked to use the special fast path for loopback operations.</p>
<p>Once an application establishes the connection on a loopback interface using the fast path, all packets for the lifetime of the connection must use the fast path.</p>
<p>Applying <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> to a socket which will be connected to a non-loopback path will have no effect.</p>
<p>This TCP loopback optimization results in packets that flow through the Transport Layer (TL) instead of the traditional loopback through the Network Layer.
This optimization improves the latency for loopback packets.
Once an application opts in for a connection level setting to use the loopback fast path, all packets will follow the loopback path.
For loopback communications, congestion and packet drop are not expected.
The notion of congestion control and reliable delivery in TCP will be unnecessary.
This, however, is not true for flow control.
Without flow control, the sender can overwhelm the receive buffer, leading to erroneous TCP loopback behavior.
The flow control in the TCP optimized loopback path is maintained by placing send requests in a queue.
When receive buffer is full, the TCP/IP stack guarantees that the sends won't complete until the queue is serviced maintaining flow control.</p>
<p>TCP fast path loopback connections in the presence of a Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) callout for connection data must take the un-optimized slow path for loopback.
So WFP filters will prevent this new loopback fast path from being used.
When a WFP filter is enabled, the system we will use the slow path even if the <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> IOCTL was set.
This ensures that user-mode applications have the full WFP security capability.</p>
<p>By default, <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> is disabled.</p>
<p>Only a subset of the TCP/IP socket options are supported when the <strong>SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH</strong> IOCTL is used to enable the loopback fast path on a socket.
The list of supported options includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>IP_TTL</strong></li>
<li><strong>IP_UNICAST_IF</strong></li>
<li><strong>IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS</strong></li>
<li><strong>IPV6_UNICAST_IF</strong></li>
<li><strong>IPV6_V6ONLY</strong></li>
<li><strong>SO_CONDITIONAL_ACCEPT</strong></li>
<li><strong>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</strong></li>
<li><strong>SO_PORT_SCALABILITY</strong></li>
<li><strong>SO_RCVBUF</strong></li>
<li><strong>SO_REUSEADDR</strong></li>
<li><strong>TCP_BSDURGENT</strong></li>
</ul>

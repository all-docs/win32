<h1>IPv6 Forwarding Tunneled Packets</h1>
<p>There is a limitation in the code that receives encapsulated (tunneled) packets and demultiplexes them to a specific interface. If you want to forward tunneled packets received through a configured tunnel, then it is necessary to enable forwarding on any 6-over-4 interfaces as well as interface #2. Just enabling forwarding on interface #2 will not work. Typically when configuring a router, you would enable forwarding on all interfaces except loopback.</p>

<h1>Semantic Differences Between Multipoint Sockets and Regular Sockets in the SPI</h1>
<p>In the control plane, there are some significant semantic differences between a c_root socket and a regular point-to-point socket:</p>
<ul>
<li>The c_root socket can be used in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpwspjoinleaf"><strong>WSPJoinLeaf</strong></a> to join a new leaf.</li>
<li>Placing a c_root socket into the listening mode (by calling <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566297(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPListen</strong></a>) does not preclude the c_root socket from being used in a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpwspjoinleaf"><strong>WSPJoinLeaf</strong></a> to add a new leaf, or for sending and receiving multipoint data.</li>
<li>The closing of a c_root socket will cause all the associated c_leaf sockets to get FD_CLOSE notification.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no semantic differences between a c_leaf socket and a regular socket in the control plane, except that the c_leaf socket can be used in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpwspjoinleaf"><strong>WSPJoinLeaf</strong></a>, and the use of c_leaf socket in <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566297(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPListen</strong></a> indicates that only multipoint connection requests should be accepted.</p>
<p>In the data plane, the semantic differences between the d_root socket and a regular point-to-point socket are</p>
<ul>
<li>The data sent on the d_root socket will be delivered to all the leaves in the same multipoint session.</li>
<li>The data received on the d_root socket may be from any of the leaves.</li>
</ul>
<p>The d_leaf socket in the rooted data plane has no semantic difference from the regular socket, however, in the nonrooted data plane, the data sent on the d_leaf socket will go to all of the other leaf nodes, and the data received could be from any of the other leaf nodes. As mentioned earlier, the information about whether the d_leaf socket is in a rooted or nonrooted data plane is contained in the corresponding <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa"><strong>WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</strong></a> structure for the socket.</p>

<h1>Best Practices for Interactive Applications</h1>
<p>In morphing the Life cell update code, several guidelines for writing high performance network applications have been uncovered. Some general strategies to apply when writing these types of applications are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the data stream as much as possible, rather than going in chunks.</li>
<li>Use a few large transactions rather than many small ones. Large transactions can also be efficiently streamed.</li>
<li>Recognize that the network is a slow, unreliable resource and develop each application to minimize its reliance on the network.</li>
<li>Use a well-architected representation of the data on the network. The data representation should be computer-architecture agnostic, contain no fat, and possibly be compressed.</li>
<li>During initialization and shutdown, do not make the user wait for the network to start up or shut down. Network related initialization could take a relatively long time. Separate the noncritical network code.</li>
<li>Handle errors as appropriate to their impact. Not all errors are critical. Implement recovery mechanisms and provide nonintrusive user feedback.</li>
<li>Use remote procedure calls (RPC) only when appropriate. RPC is synchronous on WindowsÂ Me/98 and always results in chatty, fat protocols when used to send small amounts of data.</li>
<li>Measure your network overhead using Netstat; you may be surprised at what your measurements reveal.</li>
<li>Test the application on a variety of networks, especially slow or loss-prone networks. Wireless LAN networks, modems, and virtual private networks (VPN) over the Internet are good networks for testing.</li>
</ul>

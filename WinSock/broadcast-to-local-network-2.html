<h1>Broadcast to Local Network</h1>
<p>A broadcast can be made to the locally attached network by setting <strong>sa_netnum</strong> to binary zeros (0) and <strong>sa_nodenum</strong> to binary ones (1). This broadcast may be sent to the primary network for the device, or to all locally attached networks at the option of the service provider. Broadcasts to the local network are not propagated by routers.</p>

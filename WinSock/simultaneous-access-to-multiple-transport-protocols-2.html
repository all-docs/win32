<h1>Simultaneous Access to Multiple Transport Protocols</h1>
<p>A transport protocol must be properly installed on the system and registered with Windows Sockets to be accessible to an application. The Ws2_32.dll library exports a set of functions to facilitate the registration process. This includes creating a new registration and removing an existing one.</p>
<p>When new registrations are created, the caller (that is, the stack vendor's installation script) supplies one or more filled in <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa"><strong>WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</strong></a> structures containing a complete set of information about the protocol. For more information, see <a href="about-the-winsock-spi.html">Windows Sockets 2 SPI</a>. Any transport stack installed in this manner is referred to as a Windows Sockets service provider.</p>
<p>On WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 2 (SP2), Windows ServerÂ 2003 with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1), and WindowsÂ Vista and later. the Winsock catalog that contains a list of installed transport and namespace providers can be displayed in a command prompt with the following command:</p>
<p><strong>netsh winsock show catalog</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) includes <em>Sporder.exe</em>, which enables the user to view and modify the order in which service providers are enumerated. Using <em>Sporder.exe</em>, a user can manually establish a particular TCP/IP protocol stack as the default TCP/IP provider if more than one such stack is present.</p>
<p>The <em>Sporder.exe</em> application uses exported functions from <em>Sporder.dll</em> to reorder the service providers. As a result, installation applications can use the interface provided by <em>Sporder.dll</em> to programmatically reorder service providers.</p>

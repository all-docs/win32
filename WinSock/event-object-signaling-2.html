<h1>Event Object Signaling</h1>
<p><a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566287(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPEventSelect</strong></a> behaves exactly like <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742267(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPAsyncSelect</strong></a> except that, rather than cause a Windows message to be sent upon the occurrence of any nominated FD_XXX network event (for example, FD_READ, FD_WRITE, etc.), a designated event object is set.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that a particular FD_XXX network event has occurred is remembered by the service provider. This is needed since the occurrence of any and all nominated network events will result in a single event object becoming signaled. A call to <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566284(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPEnumNetworkEvents</strong></a> causes the current contents of the network event memory to be copied to a client-supplied buffer and the network event memory to be cleared. The client may also designate a particular event object to be cleared atomically along with the network event memory.</p>

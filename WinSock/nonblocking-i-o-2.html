<h1>Nonblocking Input/Output</h1>
<p>If a socket is in nonblocking mode, any I/O operation must either complete immediately or return the error code WSAEWOULDBLOCK indicating that the operation cannot be finished right away. In the latter case, a mechanism is needed to discover when it is appropriate to try the operation again with the expectation that the operation will succeed. A set of network events has been defined for this purpose. These events can be polled or waited on by using <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742289(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPSelect</strong></a>, or they can be registered for asynchronous delivery by calling <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms742267(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPAsyncSelect</strong></a> or <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566287(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPEventSelect</strong></a>. See <a href="notification-of-network-events-2.html">Notification of Network Events</a> for more information.</p>

<h1>Binding to a Local Address</h1>
<p>Before a socket can be used to set up a connection or receive a connection request, it needs to be bound to a local address. This could be done explicitly by calling <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566268(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPBind</strong></a>, or implicitly by <a href="/previous-versions/windows/hardware/network/ff566275(v=vs.85)"><strong>WSPConnect</strong></a> if the socket is unbound when this function is called.</p>

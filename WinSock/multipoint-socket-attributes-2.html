<h1>Multipoint Socket Attributes</h1>
<p>In some instances sockets joined to a multipoint session may have some behavioral differences from point-to-point sockets. For example, a d_leaf socket in a rooted data plane scheme can only send information to the d_root participant. This creates a need for the client to be able to indicate the intended use of a socket coincident with its creation. This is done through four multipoint attribute flags that can be set through the <em>dwFlags</em> parameter in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpwspsocket"><strong>WSPSocket</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_C_ROOT, for the creation of a socket acting as a c_root, and only allowed if a rooted control plane is indicated in the corresponding <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa"><strong>WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</strong></a> entry.</li>
<li>WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_C_LEAF, for the creation of a socket acting as a c_leaf, and only allowed if XP1_SUPPORT_MULTIPOINT is indicated in the corresponding <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa"><strong>WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</strong></a> entry.</li>
<li>WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_D_ROOT, for the creation of a socket acting as a d_root, and only allowed if a rooted data plane is indicated in the corresponding <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa"><strong>WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</strong></a> entry.</li>
<li>WSA_FLAG_MULTIPOINT_D_LEAF, for the creation of a socket acting as a d_leaf, and only allowed if XP1_SUPPORT_MULTIPOINT is indicated in the corresponding <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa"><strong>WSAPROTOCOL_INFO</strong></a> entry.</li>
</ul>
<p>When creating a multipoint socket, exactly one of the two control plane flags, and one of the two data plane flags must be set in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Ws2spi/nc-ws2spi-lpwspsocket"><strong>WSPSocket</strong></a>'s <em>dwFlags</em> parameter. Thus, the four possibilities for creating multipoint sockets are: &quot;c_root/d_root&quot;, &quot;c_root/d_leaf&quot;, &quot;c_leaf/d_root&quot;, or &quot;c_leaf /d_leaf&quot;.</p>

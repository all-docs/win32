<h1>Accepting a Connection (Windows Sockets 2)</h1>
<p>Once the socket is listening for a connection, the program must handle connection requests on that socket.</p>
<p><strong>To accept a connection on a socket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a temporary <strong>SOCKET</strong> object called ClientSocket for accepting connections from clients.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>
SOCKET ClientSocket;


</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normally a server application would be designed to listen for connections from multiple clients. For high-performance servers, multiple threads are commonly used to handle the multiple client connections.</p>
<p>There are several different programming techniques using Winsock that can be used to listen for multiple client connections. One programming technique is to create a continuous loop that checks for connection requests using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-listen"><strong>listen</strong></a> function (see <a href="listening-on-a-socket.html">Listening on a Socket</a>). If a connection request occurs, the application calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-accept"><strong>accept</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/mswsock/nf-mswsock-acceptex"><strong>AcceptEx</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaaccept"><strong>WSAAccept</strong></a> function and passes the work to another thread to handle the request. Several other programming techniques are possible.</p>
<p>Note that this basic example is very simple and does not use multiple threads. The example also just listens for and accepts only a single connection.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>
ClientSocket = INVALID_SOCKET;

// Accept a client socket
ClientSocket = accept(ListenSocket, NULL, NULL);
if (ClientSocket == INVALID_SOCKET) {
    printf(&quot;accept failed: %d\n&quot;, WSAGetLastError());
    closesocket(ListenSocket);
    WSACleanup();
    return 1;
}
 

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the client connection has been accepted, a server application would normally pass the accepted client socket (the ClientSocket variable in the above sample code) to a worker thread or an I/O completion port and continue accepting additional connections. In this basic example, the server continues to the next step.</p>
<p>There are a number of other programming techniques that can be used to listen for and accept multiple connections. These include using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-select"><strong>select</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsapoll"><strong>WSAPoll</strong></a> functions. Examples of some of these various programming techniques are illustrated in the <a href="getting-started-with-winsock.html">Advanced Winsock Samples</a> included with the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
On Unix systems, a common programming technique for servers was for an application to listen for connections. When a connection was accepted, the parent process would call the <strong>fork</strong> function to create a new child process to handle the client connection, inheriting the socket from the parent. This programming technique is not supported on Windows, since the <strong>fork</strong> function is not supported. This technique is also not usually suitable for high-performance servers, since the resources needed to create a new process are much greater than those needed for a thread.</p>

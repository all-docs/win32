<h1>Directed Broadcast</h1>
<p>Generally considered more network friendly than an all-routes broadcast, a directed broadcast limits itself to the local network that you specify. Fill <strong>sa_netnum</strong> with the target network number and <strong>sa_nodenum</strong> with binary ones. Routers forward this request to the destination network where it becomes a local broadcast. Intermediate networks do not see this packet as a broadcast.</p>

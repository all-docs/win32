<h1>Asynchronous Notification Using Event Objects</h1>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect"><strong>WSAEventSelect</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaenumnetworkevents"><strong>WSAEnumNetworkEvents</strong></a> functions are provided to accommodate applications such as daemons and services that have no user interface (and hence do not use Windows handles). The <strong>WSAEventSelect</strong> function behaves exactly like the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-wsaasyncselect"><strong>WSAAsyncSelect</strong></a> function. However, instead of causing a Windows message to be sent on the occurrence of an FD_XXX network event (for example, FD_READ and FD_WRITE), an application-designated event object is set.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that a particular FD_XXX network event has occurred is remembered by the service provider. The application can call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect"><strong>WSAEnumNetworkEvents</strong></a> to have the current contents of the network event memory copied to an application-supplied buffer and to have the network event memory automatically cleared. If needed, the application can also designate a particular event object that is cleared along with the network event memory.</p>

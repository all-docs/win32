<h1>About Servers and Clients</h1>
<p>There are two distinct types of socket network applications: Server and Client.</p>
<p>Servers and Clients have different behaviors; therefore, the process of creating them is different. What follows is the general model for creating a streaming TCP/IP Server and Client.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<ol>
<li>Initialize Winsock.</li>
<li>Create a socket.</li>
<li>Bind the socket.</li>
<li>Listen on the socket for a client.</li>
<li>Accept a connection from a client.</li>
<li>Receive and send data.</li>
<li>Disconnect.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Client</h2>
<ol>
<li>Initialize Winsock.</li>
<li>Create a socket.</li>
<li>Connect to the server.</li>
<li>Send and receive data.</li>
<li>Disconnect.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Some of the steps are the same for a client and a server. These steps are implemented almost exactly alike. Some of the steps in this guide will be specific to the type of application being created.</p>

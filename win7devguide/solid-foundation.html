<h1>Solid Foundation</h1>
<p>WindowsÂ 7 provides a highly productive developer platform and tools that deliver on core operating system fundamentals. WindowsÂ 7 builds upon the WindowsÂ Vista platform, giving developers the power to build applications that are compatible with both platforms while limiting application compatibility issues. WindowsÂ 7 dramatically improves performance and power management so that you can create applications that optimize the mobile experience. As a result, your applications will be more visually appealing, easier to create, and support a wider range of international standards. Advances have also been made in global support, accessibility, and application deployment.</p>

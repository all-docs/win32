<h1>API Features (Direct3D 10)</h1>
<p>The Direct3D 10 graphics pipeline represents a fundamental architecture change, rebuilt from the ground-up in hardware and software to power the next-generation of games and 3D multimedia applications. It uses the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM), which enables performance and behavioral enhancements such as virtual GPU memory.</p>
<p>Developers familiar with Direct3D 9 will discover a series of functional enhancements and performance improvements in Direct3D 10, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to process entire primitives in the new <a href="/previous-versions//bb205146(v=vs.85)">geometry-shader stage</a>.</li>
<li>The ability to output pipeline-generated vertex data to memory using the <a href="../direct3d11/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-output-stream-stage.html">stream-output stage</a>.</li>
<li>Organization of pipeline state into 5 immutable <a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-api-features-state-objects.html">state objects</a>, enabling fast configuration of the pipeline.</li>
<li>Organization of shader constants into <a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-resources-types.html">constant buffers</a>, minimizing bandwidth overhead for supplying shader-constant data.</li>
<li>The ability to perform per-primitive material swapping and setup using a geometry shader.</li>
<li>New <a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-resources-types.html">resource types</a> (including texture arrays that can be indexed from shaders) and resource formats.</li>
<li>Increased generalization of resource access using a <a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-resources-access-views.html">view</a>.</li>
<li>Legacy hardware capability bits (caps) have been removed in favor of a rich set of guaranteed functionality, which targets Direct3D 10-class hardware (minimum).</li>
<li><a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-api-features-layers.html">Layered Runtime</a> - The Direct3D 10 API is constructed with layers, starting with the basic functionality at the core and building optional and developer-assist functionality (debug, etc.) in outer layers.</li>
<li>Full HLSL integration - All Direct3D 10 shaders are written in HLSL and implemented with the <a href="../direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-common-core.html">common-shader core</a>.</li>
<li>An increase in the number of render targets, textures, and samplers. There is also no shader length limit.</li>
<li>Integer and bitwise shader operations.</li>
<li>Readback of a depth/stencil surface or a multisampled resource, once it is no longer bound as a render target.</li>
<li>Multisampled alpha-to-coverage support.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are additional behavioral differences that Direct3D 9 developers should also be aware of (see <a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-d3d9-to-d3d10-considerations.html">Direct3D 9 to Direct3D 10 Considerations</a>).</p>
<p>Here is a list of Direct3D 9 features that either are no longer supported, or have been revised in Direct3D 10 (see <a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-api-features-deprecated.html">Deprecated Features</a>).</p>

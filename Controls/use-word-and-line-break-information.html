<h1>How to Use Word and Line Break Information</h1>
<p>A rich edit control calls a function called a word-break procedure to find breaks between words and to determine where it can break lines. The control uses this information when performing word-wrap operations and when processing CTRL+LEFT ARROW key and CTRL+RIGHT ARROW key combinations. An application can send messages to a rich edit control to replace the default word-break procedure, to retrieve word-break information, and to determine what line a given character falls on.</p>

<h3>Use Word and Line Break Information</h3>
<p>Word-break procedures for rich edit controls are similar to those for edit controls, but they have additional capabilities: word-break procedures for both kinds of controls can determine whether a character is a delimiter and can find the nearest word break before or after the specified position. A delimiter is a character that marks the end of a word, such as a space. Usually, in an edit control, a word break occurs only after delimiters. However, different rules apply to most Asian languages.</p>
<p>Word-break procedures for rich edit controls also group characters into character classes, each identified by a value in the range 0x00 through 0x0F. Breaks occur either after delimiters or between characters of different classes. Thus, a word-break procedure with different classes for alphanumeric and punctuation characters would find two word breaks in the string &quot;Win.doc&quot; (before and after the period).</p>
<p>A character's class can be combined with zero or more word-break flags to form an 8-bit value. When performing word-wrap operations, a rich edit control uses word-break flags to determine where it can break lines. Rich Edit uses the following word-break flags.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Flag</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>WBF_BREAKAFTER</td>
<td>Lines may be broken after the character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WBF_BREAKLINE</td>
<td>The character is a delimiter. Delimiters mark the ends of words. Lines may be broken after delimiters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WBF_ISWHITE</td>
<td>The character is a white-space character. Trailing white-space characters are not included in the length of a line when wrapping.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The WBF_BREAKAFTER value is used to allow wrapping after a character that does not mark the end of a word, such as a hyphen.</p>
<p>You can replace the default word-break procedure for a rich edit control with your own procedure by using the <a href="em-setwordbreakproc.html"><strong>EM_SETWORDBREAKPROC</strong></a> message. For more information about word-break procedures, see the description of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nc-winuser-editwordbreakproca"><em>EditWordBreakProc</em></a> function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
This replacement is not recommended for Microsoft Rich EditÂ 2.0 and later, due to the complexity of multilingual word breaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>For Microsoft Rich EditÂ 1.0, you can use the <a href="em-setwordbreakprocex.html"><strong>EM_SETWORDBREAKPROCEX</strong></a> message to replace the default extended word-break procedure with an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Richedit/nc-richedit-editwordbreakprocex"><em>EditWordBreakProcEx</em></a> function. This function provides additional information about the text, such as the character set. You can use the <a href="em-getwordbreakprocex.html"><strong>EM_GETWORDBREAKPROCEX</strong></a> message to retrieve the address of the current extended word-break procedure. Note that Microsoft Rich EditÂ 2.0 and later do not support <em>EditWordBreakProcEx</em>, <strong>EM_GETWORDBREAKPROCEX</strong>, and <strong>EM_SETWORDBREAKPROCEX</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="em-findwordbreak.html"><strong>EM_FINDWORDBREAK</strong></a> message to find word breaks or to determine a character's class and word-break flags. In turn, the control calls its word-break procedure to get the requested information.</p>
<p>To determine which line a given character falls on, you can use the <a href="em-exlinefromchar.html"><strong>EM_EXLINEFROMCHAR</strong></a> message.</p>

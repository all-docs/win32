<h1>About Buttons</h1>
<p>A button is a control the that user can click to provide input to an application.</p>
<p>There are several types of buttons and one or more button styles to distinguish between buttons of the same type. The user clicks a button by using the mouse or keyboard. Clicking a button typically changes its visual appearance and state (from checked to cleared, for example). The system, the button, and the application cooperate in changing the button's appearance and state. A button can send messages to its parent window, and a parent window can send messages to a button. Some buttons are painted by the system, and some by the application. Buttons can be used alone or in groups and can appear with or without application-defined text (a label). They belong to the BUTTON window class.</p>

<h1>Control Point Security Considerations</h1>
<p>When you are creating a control point, you need to take into consideration the following security issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>All control point searches are by default sent with a TTL of 1. This means that only devices within the same subnet are discovered. You can configure a higher TTL in the registry.</li>
<li>A device's device and service description is only downloaded if it is present on the same device which sent the device announcement.</li>
<li>A device is only sent control and subscription requests if its control and subscription URLs are on the same device that sent the device announcements.</li>
</ul>

<h1>About the Device Host API</h1>
<p>The Device Host API with UPnP technology is a framework for implementing UPnP-based device functionality on the Windows platform. Developers who are creating devices by using the Device Host API with UPnP technology (referred to as <a href="h-gly.html"><em>hosted devices</em></a>) need only implement the device's core functionality. Developers can rely on the device host to handle the UPnP-specific details of discovery, description, control, eventing, and presentation. The device host validates incoming data from UPnP-based clients and formats all outgoing data from hosted devices according to the UPnP device architecture.</p>
<p>The following sections explain, in general, how the UPnP device host works:</p>

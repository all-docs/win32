<h1>Generic User Control Point Application</h1>
<p>The generic user control point (UCP) application allows you to discover devices, control those discovered devices, and view the related eventing information, all using a graphical interface.</p>
<p><strong>To start the generic UCP application</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create and configure the samples\netds\upnp\GenericUCP\CPP\devtype.txt file (or the \VisualBasic\devtype.txt file) with device information. This file allows you to configure the generic UCP for the &quot;find by type&quot; and &quot;async find&quot; searches. Each line of the file must contain a device type and the related description. For example:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>upnp:rootdevice All Root Devices
urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:mediaplayer:1    Media Player
</code></pre>
<p>This example is for a fictitious media player device. The &quot;Media Player&quot; at the end of the second line is not a part of the device type, it is for informational purposes in the Generic UCP application. The same applies to &quot;All Root Devices&quot; in the first line.</p>
<p>Add a line that contains your specific device type and description for each device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create and configure the samples\netds\upnp\GenericUCP\CPP\udn.txt file (or the \VisualBasic\udn.txt file) with UDN information for your devices. This file allows you to configure the generic UCP for the &quot;find by UDN&quot; search. Each line uses the following form:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>uuid:{7d50b574-4213-4b88-84d9-e5c9241fcb3a}
</code></pre>
<p>Add a line that contains your specific UDN for each device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run GenericUCP.exe. The <strong>Generic UCP</strong> window appears.</p>

<h1>About the Control Point API</h1>
<p>UPnP technology enables dynamic networking of intelligent appliances, PCs, and other control points. The dynamic networking is available over a variety of physical media. The Microsoft implementation of the Control Point API with UPnP technology consists of a set of COM objects that are used to write applications and Web pages that find and control UPnP-based devices. For example, a UPnP-capable VCR can be controlled from a Web page that was specifically designed to control it. To extend this concept, developers can to control many appliances from a central, remote, or peer location.</p>
<p>Applications created with the Control Point API with UPnP technology range from scripts embedded in HTML pages to full-fledged C++ programs. The Control Point API with UPnP technology supports Microsoft Visual Basic development system, Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), and C++.</p>

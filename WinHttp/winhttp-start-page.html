<h1>Windows HTTP Services</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to other HTTP servers.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>WinHTTP supports desktop client applications, Windows services, and Windows server-based applications.</p>
<p>For more information on how to use WinHTTP for applications built on the Microsoft .NET Framework, see the <a href="/dotnet/api/system.net.http">WinHttpHandler API</a></p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>WinHTTP offers both a C/C++ application programming interface (API) and a Component Object Model (COM) automation component suitable for use in Active Server Pages (ASP) based applications.</p>
<p>A basic understanding of the HTTP protocol is important to use either interface.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>WinHTTP 5.1 offers improvements over version 5.0. It is included in the operating system. For more information about new features, see <a href="what-s-new-in-winhttp-5-1.html">What's New in WinHTTP 5.1</a> and <a href="what-s-new-in-windows-longhorn.html">What's New in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
The WinHTTP 5.0 download is no longer available. As of October 1, 2004, Microsoft removed the WinHTTP 5.0 SDK download and terminated product support for version 5.0.</p>

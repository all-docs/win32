<h1>About Bluetooth</h1>
<p>Bluetooth is an industry-standard protocol that enables wireless connectivity for a multitude of devices, including computers, printers, mobile phones, and handheld devices.</p>
<p>Key Bluetooth features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A low-cost, low-power consumption wireless protocol with industry-standard support and worldwide acceptance.</li>
<li>A defined and familiar programming interface that developers can use to quickly develop or port applications.</li>
<li>An official Web site and an industry-wide cooperative organization that explains, promotes, and standardizes Bluetooth technology. For more information, see <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/">www.bluetooth.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bluetooth on Windows provides core services that are similar to those exposed by Transmission Control Protocol (the TCP part of TCP/IP). Like many networking protocols and services, Bluetooth connectivity and data transfer are programmed through Windows Sockets function calls, using common Windows Sockets programming techniques and specific Bluetooth extensions. However, because significant differences exist between a wired, fixed network and a wireless ad-hoc network, Bluetooth provides extensions such as service/device discovery and notification that enable applications to operate properly in the wireless environment. These extensions also pave the way for simple porting to similar technologies, such as IrDA, or future wireless transports.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides support for Bluetooth on WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1) and later, on WindowsÂ XP Embedded with Service Pack 2, and on WindowsÂ CE. Bluetooth applications that run on WindowsÂ XP should be able to run on a WindowsÂ XP Embedded-based run-time image that includes the required dependencies. For more information see <a href="/lifecycle/products/windows-xp-embedded">Windows XP Embedded</a>. For more information about WindowsÂ CE programming, consult the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=17310">WindowsÂ CE SDK</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft provides two approaches for programming Bluetooth on Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Windows Sockets interface</li>
<li>Managing devices directly by using nonsocket Bluetooth interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>This section provides overview information about both of these approaches in the following topics. For more information about using Windows Sockets API elements to program Bluetooth, see <a href="bluetooth-programming-with-windows-sockets.html">Bluetooth Programming with Windows Sockets</a>.</p>

<h1>Character Sets</h1>
<p>A &quot;character set&quot; is a mapping of characters to their identifying code values. The character set most commonly used in computers today is <a href="unicode.html">Unicode</a>, a global standard for character encoding. Internally, Windows applications use the UTF-16 implementation of Unicode. In UTF-16, most characters are identified by two-byte codes. The less commonly used supplementary characters are each represented by a surrogate pair, which is a pair of two-byte codes. For more information, see <a href="surrogates-and-supplementary-characters.html">Surrogates and Supplementary Characters</a>.</p>
<p>Some Windows applications must work with the older character sets that are native to WindowsÂ Me/98/95. <a href="code-pages.html">Windows code pages</a> allow your application to work with these character sets. These character sets can be divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="single-byte-character-sets.html">Single-byte character sets</a> (SBCS). In an SBCS, each character is identified by a value one byte wide.</li>
<li>Multibyte character sets, in particular the <a href="double-byte-character-sets.html">double-byte character sets</a> (DBCS). Multibyte character sets provide a means to represent the large number of characters in many Asian languages.</li>
</ul>

<h1>LOCALE_SCONSOLEFALLBACKNAME</h1>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ Vista and later:</strong> Preferred locale to use for console display. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is 85, including a terminating null character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
In general, applications should not make direct use of LOCALE_SCONSOLEFALLBACKNAME data. To determine what language resources to use in a console window, an application should call either <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-setthreaduilanguage">SetThreadUILanguage</a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-setthreadpreferreduilanguages">SetThreadPreferredUILanguages</a>. These functions use the console fallback data as a factor in choosing a language that is legible in the console, but it is not the sole determinant. In particular, the console is limited to displaying characters from a single code page. For example, el-GR for Greek (Greece) is a valid console language, but if the current console code page is Latin-1 (code page 1252) the console displays Greek text mostly as a series of character-not-found symbols.</p>

<p>If the language corresponding to this locale is supported in the console, the value is the same as that for <a href="locale-sname.html">LOCALE_SNAME</a>, that is, the locale itself can be used for console display. However, the console cannot display languages that can be rendered only with <a href="uniscribe.html">Uniscribe</a>. For example, the console cannot display Arabic or the various Indic languages. Therefore, the LOCALE_SCONSOLEFALLBACKNAME value for locales corresponding to these languages is different from the value for LOCALE_SNAME.</p>
<p>For predefined locales, if the fallback value is different from the value for the locale itself, the value for the neutral locale is used. A specific locale is associated with both a language and a country/region, while a neutral locale is associated with a language but is not associated with any country/region. For example, ar-SA falls back to &quot;en&quot;, not to &quot;en-US&quot;. This policy of using neutral locales is implemented consistently for predefined locales and is strongly recommended for custom locales. However, the policy is not enforced. For a custom locale, your application can use a specific locale instead of a neutral locale as a fallback.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
None of the functions described in <a href="calling-the--locale-name--functions.html">Calling the &quot;Locale Name&quot; Functions</a> accept neutral locales as inputs. Thus LOCALE_SCONSOLEFALLBACKNAME data is of very limited use. In particular, neither <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoa"><strong>GetLocaleInfo</strong></a> nor <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoex"><strong>GetLocaleInfoEx</strong></a> accepts neutral locales as inputs.</p>

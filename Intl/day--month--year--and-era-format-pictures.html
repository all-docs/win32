<h1>Day, Month, Year, and Era Format Pictures</h1>
<p>The application uses the elements described in this topic to construct a null-terminated format picture string. If spaces are used to separate the elements in the string, these spaces will appear in the same location in the output string.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The format types &quot;d&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, and &quot;y&quot; must be lowercase and the letter &quot;M&quot; must be uppercase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>For example, to get the date string &quot;Wed, Aug 31 94&quot;, the application uses the picture string &quot;ddd',' MMM dd yy&quot;.</p>
<p>The application uses single quotation marks to mark characters to display exactly as specified. If the application must display a single quotation mark, it should place two single quotation marks in a row. For example, 'abc''bar', is displayed as &quot;abc'bar&quot;.</p>
<p>The following table defines the format types used to represent days.</p>

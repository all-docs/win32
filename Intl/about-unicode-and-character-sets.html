<h1>About Unicode and Character Sets</h1>
<p>The world's character-based data was developed using both <a href="unicode.html">Unicode</a> and traditional character sets. Because of this, Windows provides character set functions that help applications convert the character-based data from its original character set to Unicode or another traditional character set. These character set functions also help applications create character-based data that can be transferred to and used on any operating system, including those that do not support Unicode.</p>
<p>For details about Unicode beyond the scope of this overview, see <a href="https://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html">The Unicode Standard</a>.</p>

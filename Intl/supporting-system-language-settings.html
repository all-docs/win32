<h1>Supporting System Language Settings</h1>
<p>The preferred way for your MUI application to set application language preferences is to support the same set of user interface languages as the target operating system. The application simply depends on the operating system to select the correct user interface language for display. An associated sample is provided in <a href="mui-system-settings-application-sample.html">MUI: System Settings Application Sample</a>.</p>

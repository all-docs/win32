<h1>Filtering Languages in a MUI Console Application</h1>
<p>A MUI console application can support either system settings or application-specific settings for its user interface languages. This topic discusses the filtering of languages for this type of application.</p>
<h2>Limit the Languages to Display</h2>
<p>Unlike a graphical window, the Windows console cannot display <a href="uniscribe-glossary.html">complex scripts</a>, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, Hindi, Urdu, Thai, and many others. Therefore, many user interface languages cannot be displayed by the console under any circumstances.</p>
<p>The console can display only characters from the single <a href="code-pages.html">OEM code page</a> associated with the current language for non-Unicode applications. For each OEM code page, the console uses a particular font, and this might not provide full coverage for that code page.</p>
<p>These console-related limitations reduce the number of user interface languages that the console can display on a particular computer. For example, if the current language for non-Unicode applications is Japanese and the user tries to display German text in the console, characters with umlauts do not display correctly. If the current language for non-Unicode applications is German and the user wants to display Japanese text in the console, the results are much worse, rendering the text almost incomprehensible.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
When providing console support for your MUI applications, remember that the console provides only limited support for <a href="input-method-manager.html">input method editors</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Set the Language for Console Output</h2>
<p>On WindowsÂ Vista and later, a console application sets the language to support the console display by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-setthreadpreferreduilanguages"><strong>SetThreadPreferredUILanguages</strong></a>. In this call, the application passes MUI_CONSOLE_FILTER in the <em>dwFlags</em> parameter and <strong>NULL</strong> for <em>pwszLanguagesBuffer</em>. An alternative is to call <a href="/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-setthreaduilanguage"><strong>SetThreadUILanguage</strong></a> with a language identifier of 0. This setting causes the function to select the language that best supports the console display.</p>
<p>On WindowsÂ XP, the application can only set the language for console output by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-setthreaduilanguage"><strong>SetThreadUILanguage</strong></a> with a language identifier of 0.</p>

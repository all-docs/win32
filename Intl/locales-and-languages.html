<h1>Locales and Languages</h1>
<p>The term &quot;language&quot; indicates a collection of properties used in spoken and written communication. Each language has a language name and a language identifier that indicate the particular <a href="code-pages.html">code page</a> (ANSI, DOS, Macintosh) used to represent the <a href="table-of-geographical-locations.html">geographical location</a> for the language on the operating system. A neutral language is indicated by a name such as &quot;en&quot; for English. A more geographically specific language can be indicated by a name that includes both locale and country/region information. For example, the locale English (United States) has the language name &quot;en-US&quot;.</p>
<p>A &quot;locale&quot; is a collection of language-related user preference information represented as a list of values. WindowsÂ XP supports more than 150 locales, and WindowsÂ Vista supports about 200. Each locale is defined by a language and a sort order, and has both a locale name and a locale identifier. An example of a locale name for German (Germany) is &quot;de-DE_phonebook&quot;.</p>
<p>Each operating system has at least one installed locale and often has many locales from which the user can select. Each locale has a variety of information associated with it, other than its name and identifier. Locale information types are described in <a href="locale-information-constants.html">Locale Information Constants</a>.</p>
<p>The operating system assigns a locale to each thread, initially assigning the &quot;system default locale,&quot; defined by <a href="locale-system-default.html">LOCALE_SYSTEM_DEFAULT</a>. This locale is set when the operating system is installed or when the user selects it using the regional and language options portion of the Control Panel. When running a thread in a process belonging to the user, the operating system assigns the &quot;user default locale&quot; to the thread. This locale is defined by <a href="locale-user-default.html">LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT</a>. An application can override either default by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-setthreadlocale"><strong>SetThreadLocale</strong></a> function to explicitly set the locale for a thread.</p>
<p>Implementation of a language requires a corresponding locale. The operating system implements a neutral language by selecting the data for the locale associated with a specific version of the language, usually the most widespread locale.</p>
<p>Starting with WindowsÂ Vista, it is possible for a particular language to correspond to a supplemental locale, which is a type of custom locale. Since supplemental locales all share a single locale identifier, your applications should handle these locales and the corresponding languages by name instead of by identifier.</p>
<p>Language concepts are closely related to locale concepts, but the two terms are not interchangeable. As a general rule, functions related to the <a href="multilingual-user-interface.html">Multilingual User Interface</a> deal with languages, while the NLS functions act upon locales.</p>

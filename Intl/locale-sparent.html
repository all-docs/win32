<h1>LOCALE_SPARENT</h1>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ Vista and later:</strong> Fallback locale, used by the resource loader. The maximum number of characters allowed for this string is 85, including a terminating null character.</p>
<p>Locales have a hierarchy in which the parent of a specific locale is a neutral locale. A specific locale is associated with both a language and a country/region, while a neutral locale is associated with a language but is not associated with any country/region. The parent locale is used to decide the first fallback to be tried when a resource for a specific locale is not available. For example, the parent locale for &quot;en-US&quot; (0x0409) is &quot;en&quot; (0x0009). When a resource is not available for the specific &quot;en-US&quot; locale, the resource loader falls back to use the resource that is available for the neutral &quot;en&quot; locale. See <a href="user-interface-language-management.html">User Interface Language Management</a> for further details of the resource loader fallback strategy.</p>
<p>This pattern is consistent for predefined locales. However, the parent locale is not determined by any manipulation of the locale name. That is, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoa"><strong>GetLocaleInfo</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoex"><strong>GetLocaleInfoEx</strong></a> do not parse a string such as &quot;en-US&quot; to get the value &quot;en&quot;. Instead, they look at the stored locale data. For predefined locales, the value follows the expected pattern, in which the parent of a specific locale is the corresponding neutral locale and the parent of a neutral locale is the invariant locale. While it is recommended that custom locales follow a similar strategy in terms of defining their parent locale, this is not enforced. The application implementing a custom locale can specify a less obviously appropriate parent.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
Since none of the functions described in <a href="calling-the--locale-name--functions.html">Calling the &quot;Locale Name&quot; Functions</a> accept neutral locales as inputs, this LOCALE_SPARENT data is of very limited use. In particular, neither <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoa"><strong>GetLocaleInfo</strong></a> nor <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getlocaleinfoex"><strong>GetLocaleInfoEx</strong></a> accepts neutral locales as inputs.</p>

<h1>IME Messages</h1>
<p>The operating system sends IME window messages to the window procedure of an application when certain events occur that affect the IME windows. For example, the operating system sends the <a href="wm-ime-setcontext.html"><strong>WM_IME_SETCONTEXT</strong></a> message to the application when a window is activated. IME-unaware applications pass these messages to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-defwindowproca">DefWindowProc</a> function, which sends them to the corresponding default IME window. IME-aware applications either process these messages or forward them to their own IME windows.</p>
<p>Your application can direct an IME window to carry out a command, for example, change the position of a composition window, by using the <a href="wm-ime-control.html"><strong>WM_IME_CONTROL</strong></a> message. The IME notifies the application about changes to the composition string by using the <a href="wm-ime-composition.html"><strong>WM_IME_COMPOSITION</strong></a> message, and about general changes to the status of the IME windows by sending the <a href="wm-ime-notify.html"><strong>WM_IME_NOTIFY</strong></a> message.</p>

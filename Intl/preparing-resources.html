<h1>Preparing Resources</h1>
<p>Resource preparation for a MUI application supports both Win32 PE and non-Win32 PE models. Win32 PE resources are provided in PE-based files, such as .dll, .exe, or .sys files. Non-Win32 PE resources are furnished in a customized module of your choosing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
It is highly recommended for you to use Win32 PE resources for Win32 MUI applications, as these resources are completely supported by the MUI resource technology. Non-Win32 PE resource files can be located by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-getfilemuipath"><strong>GetFileMUIPath</strong></a> function as described in <a href="locating-non-win32-pe-resources.html">Locating Non-Win32 PE Resources</a>, but the application must provide its own functionality to find and load the required resources.</p>

<h1>Custom Locales</h1>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ Vista and later:</strong> Custom locales support international properties providing a more culturally appropriate user experience than those furnished with the standard locales shipped by Microsoft with the operating system. Use of custom locales allows administrators to extend the Microsoft-provided set of locales or to replace the data in a locale that ships with Windows, for example, currency symbols or names of the months of the year.</p>
<p>The two types of custom locales are supplemental locales and replacement locales. Supplemental locales are custom locales that allow corporations, universities, governments, and other third parties to create locale data not available in the shipping operating system. Replacement locales are custom locales that ship with the operating system without changing the <a href="locale-identifiers.html">locale identifiers</a> or <a href="locale-names.html">locale names</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the Locale Builder utility provided by NLS to build custom locales. For more information, see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41158">Microsoft Locale Builder</a>. Instructions for using custom locales in your applications are provided in <a href="working-with-custom-locales.html">Working with Custom Locales</a>.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Locale identifier</td>
<td>Set to <a href="locale-custom-constants.html">LOCALE_CUSTOM_UNSPECIFIED</a> unless the locale is the user's currently selected Standards and Formats locale, in which case it is set to <a href="locale-custom-constants.html">LOCALE_CUSTOM_DEFAULT</a>.</td>

<td>en-CA-fabricam</td>
<td>Fabricam is a Canadian PC manufacturer with offices worldwide. To provide consistent user interface behavior for all its computers, the company develops a locale to use company-wide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fr-US</td>
<td>Woodlawn Bank uses WindowsÂ XP Embedded for its automated teller machines (ATMs), which the bank ships all over North America with user interfaces in French, English, and Spanish.

<h2>Replacement Locale Example</h2>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Locale name</th>
<th>Description</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>en-US</td>
<td>Fabricam is a Canadian PC manufacturer with offices worldwide. To provide consistent user interface behavior for all its computers, the company develops a locale to use company-wide. It uses a 24-hour clock, but otherwise behaves like the supported English (United States) locale. Because the custom locale is so similar to the supported locale, Fabricam decides to implement it as a replacement locale instead of a supplemental locale.</td>

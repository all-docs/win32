<h1>LOCALE_ICONSTRUCTEDLOCALE</h1>
<p>Identifier to request if the locale is a &quot;constructed&quot; locale. Use of this LCTYPE is discouraged.</p>
<p>This identifies a locale for which Windows many not have complete information and has to &quot;construct&quot; information at runtime. Typically the information provided by LOCALE_ICONSTRUCTEDLOCALE is of limited use as Windows will provide as much data as is available for every locale. Therefore, use of this LCTYPE is discouraged.</p>

<p>An example would be a request for &quot;de-US&quot;, or German in the United States. NLS will use the German language data that it can find and the United States region data that it can find.</p>
<p>This may not be perfect as, for example, the system will likely not have information about the name of United States in German. However, if the application or user desires a &quot;de-US&quot; context, then the returned data is the best available.</p>
<p>Apps that use LOCALE_ICONSTRUCTEDLOCALE to reject locales and fall back to a different locale typically end up with a worse experience, such as landing on de-DE or en-US in this example. Neither of those are close to the original request for German language with a United States region.</p>

<h1>Using Functions That Have No Unicode Equivalents</h1>
<p>Functions that have not been implemented with a <a href="unicode.html">Unicode</a> version have typically been replaced by more powerful or extended functions that do support Unicode. For example, if you are porting code that calls the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-openfile"><strong>OpenFile</strong></a> function, your application can support Unicode by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a> function instead.</p>
<p>If a function has no Unicode equivalent, the application can map characters to and from 8-bit character sets before and after the function call. For example, the number-formatting functions <strong>atoi</strong> and <strong>itoa</strong> use only the digits 0 through 9. Normally, mapping Unicode to 8-bit characters causes loss of data, but this can be avoided by making the code type-independent and making the expressions conditional. The statements in the following example, written for 8-bit characters, are type-dependent and should be changed to support Unicode.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>char str[4] = &quot;137&quot;;

int num = atoi(str);
</code></pre>
<p>These statements can be rewritten as follows to make them type-independent.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>TCHAR tstr[4] = TEXT(&quot;137&quot;);

#ifdef UNICODE
size_t cCharsConverted;
CHAR strTmp[SIZE]; // SIZE equals (2*(sizeof(tstr)+1)). This ensures enough
                   // room for the multibyte characters if they are two 
                   // bytes long and a terminating null character. See Security 
                   // Alert below. 

wcstombs_s(&amp;cCharsConverted, strTmp, sizeof(strTmp), (const wchar_t *)tstr, sizeof(strTmp));
num = atoi(strTmp);

#else

int num = atoi(tstr);

#endif 
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the standard C library function <strong>wcstombs</strong> translates Unicode to ASCII. The example relies on the fact that the digits 0 through 9 can always be translated from Unicode to ASCII, even if some of the surrounding text cannot. The <strong>atoi</strong> function stops at any character that is not a digit.</p>
<p>Your application can use the National Language Support (NLS) <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnls/nf-winnls-lcmapstringa"><strong>LCMapString</strong></a> function to process text that includes the <a href="digit-shapes.html">native digits</a> provided for some of the scripts in Unicode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Caution]<br />
Using the <strong>wcstombs</strong> function incorrectly can compromise the security of your application. Make sure that the application buffer for the string of 8-bit characters is at least of size 2*(<em>char_length</em> +1), where <em>char_length</em> represents the length of the Unicode string. This restriction is made because, with <a href="double-byte-character-sets.html">double-byte character sets</a> (DBCSs), each Unicode character can be mapped to two consecutive 8-bit characters. If the buffer does not hold the entire string, the result string is not null-terminated, posing a security risk. For more information about application security, see <a href="security-considerations--international-features.html">Security Considerations: International Features</a>.</p>

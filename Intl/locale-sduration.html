<h1>LOCALE_SDURATION</h1>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ Vista and later:</strong> Time duration format composed of format pictures listed in the following table. The format is similar to the format for <a href="locale-stime-constants.html">LOCALE_STIMEFORMAT</a>. As for LOCALE_STIMEFORMAT, this format can also include any string of characters enclosed in single quotes. Formats can include, for example, &quot;h:mm:ss&quot;, or &quot;d'd 'h'h 'm'm 's.fff's'&quot;. In comparison with LOCALE_STIMEFORMAT, there are additional format pictures for fractions of a second. Because this format is for duration, not time, it does not specify a 12- or 24-hour clock system, or include an AM/PM indicator. This constant might be used, for example, for a multi-media application that displays file time or a sporting event application that displays finish times.</p>

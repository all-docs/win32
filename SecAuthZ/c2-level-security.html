<h1>C2-level Security</h1>
<p>The following list includes some of the most important requirements of C2-level security, as defined by the U.S. Department of Defense:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be possible to control access to a resource by granting or denying access to individual users or named groups of users.</li>
<li>Memory must be protected so that its contents cannot be read after a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly"><em>process</em></a> frees it. Similarly, a secure file system, such as NTFS, must protect deleted files from being read.</li>
<li>Users must identify themselves in a unique manner, such as by password, when they log on. All auditable actions must identify the user performing the action.</li>
<li>System administrators must be able to audit security-related events. However, access to the security-related events audit data must be limited to authorized administrators.</li>
<li>The system must be protected from external interference or tampering, such as modification of the running system or of system files stored on disk.</li>
</ul>

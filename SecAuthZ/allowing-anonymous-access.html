<h1>Allowing Anonymous Access</h1>
<p>The default security policy restricts anonymous local access to having no rights. Administrators can then add or subtract rights as they see fit.</p>
<p>A local access group exists for applications with the same access rights as Everyone. Administrators can then appropriately increase or decrease the number of users in that group, named the <strong>Pre-WindowsÂ 2000-Compatible Access Group</strong>.</p>
<p>For more information, see the reference pages for the functions listed in the table of the <a href="/windows/desktop/NetMgmt/local-group-functions">Local Group Functions</a> topic.</p>

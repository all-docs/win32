<h1>Audit Generation</h1>
<p>C2-level security requirements specify that system administrators must be able to audit security-related events and that access to this audit data must be limited to authorized administrators. The Windows API provides functions enabling an administrator to monitor security-related events.</p>
<p>The security descriptor for a securable object can have a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>system access control list</em></a> (SACL). A SACL contains <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>access control entries</em></a> (ACEs) that specify the types of access attempts that generate audit reports. Each ACE identifies a trustee, a set of access rights, and a set of flags that indicate whether the system generates audit messages for failed access attempts, successful access attempts, or both.</p>
<p>The system writes audit messages to the security event log. For information about accessing the records in a security event log, see <a href="/windows/desktop/EventLog/event-logging">Event Logging</a>.</p>
<p>To read or write an object's SACL, a thread must first enable the SE_SECURITY_NAME privilege. For more information, see <a href="sacl-access-right.html">SACL Access Right</a>.</p>
<p>The Windows API also provides support for server applications to generate audit messages when a client tries to access a private object. For more information, see <a href="auditing-access-to-private-objects.html">Auditing Access To Private Objects</a>.</p>

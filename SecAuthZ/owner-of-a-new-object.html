<h1>Owner of a New Object</h1>
<p>An object's owner implicitly has WRITE_DAC access to the object. This means that the owner can modify the object's <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly"><em>discretionary access control list</em></a> (DACL), and thus, can control access to the object.</p>
<p>The owner of a new object is the default owner <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security identifier</em></a> (SID) from the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly"><em>primary</em></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/i-gly"><em>impersonation token</em></a> of the creating <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly"><em>process</em></a>. To get or set the default owner in an <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>access token</em></a>, call the <a href="/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-gettokeninformation"><strong>GetTokenInformation</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-settokeninformation"><strong>SetTokenInformation</strong></a> function with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winnt/ns-winnt-token_owner"><strong>TOKEN_OWNER</strong></a> structure. The system does not allow you to set a token's default owner to a SID that is not valid, such as the SID of another user's account.</p>
<p>A process with the SE_TAKE_OWNERSHIP privilege enabled can set itself as the owner of an object. A process with the SE_RESTORE_NAME privilege enabled or with WRITE_OWNER access to the object can set any valid user or group SID as the owner of an object.</p>

<h1>Implement an AppContainer</h1>
<p>An AppContainer is implemented by adding new information to the process token, changing <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/nf-wdm-seaccesscheck"><strong>SeAccessCheck()</strong></a> so that all legacy, unmodified access control list (ACL) objects block access requests from AppContainer processes by default, and re-ACL objects that should be available to AppContainers.</p>
<h2>The process</h2>
<p>Begin by adding new information for the process token. Then change <strong>SeAccessCheck()</strong> so that all legacy, unmodified ACLs will block access requests from AppContainer processes by default. Finally, re-ACL resources that should be available to AppContainers</p>
<p>The AppContainer SID is a persistent unique identifier for the appcontainer. Capability SIDs grant access to groups of resources to groups of AppContainers. An AppContainerNumber is a transient <strong>DWORD</strong> used to distinguish between AppContainers. However, it should not be used as an identity for the AppContainer.</p>
<p>To allow a single AppContainer to access a resource, add its AppContainerSID to the ACL for that resource.</p>
<p>To allow several specific AppContainers to access a resource, add all of their AppContainerSIDs to the ACL for that resource.</p>
<p>To manage groups of permissions, create a Capability SID (a GUID) and put that Capability SID on all of the resources to be granted. Then add the Capability SID to your process token.</p>
<p>To allow all AppContainers to access a resource, add the <strong>ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES</strong> SID to the ACL for that resource. This acts like a wildcard.</p>
<p>Both AppContainerSID and CapabilitySID support access masks in Access Control Entries (ACE). Set as appropriate.</p>

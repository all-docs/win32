<h1>ACL-based Access Control</h1>
<p>Just as the system uses <a href="security-descriptors.html">security descriptors</a> to control access to securable objects, a server can use security descriptors to control access to its private objects. For more information about the Windows security model, see <a href="access-control-model.html">Access Control Model</a>.</p>
<p>A protected server can <a href="security-descriptors-for-private-objects.html">create a security descriptor</a> with a DACL that specifies the types of access allowed for various <a href="trustees.html">trustees</a>. In a simple case, the server could create a single security descriptor to <a href="checking-access-to-private-objects.html">control access to all of the server's data and functionality</a>. For a finer granularity of protection, the server could create security descriptors for each of its private objects, or for different types of functionality.</p>
<p>For example, when a client asks the server to create a new object in a database, the server could create a security descriptor for the new private object. The server could then store the security descriptor with the private object in the database. When a client tries to access the object, the server retrieves the security descriptor to check the client's access rights. It is important to note that there is nothing in a security descriptor that associates it with the object or functionality it is protecting. Instead, it is up to the protected server to maintain the association.</p>
<p>Access to the private object can also be audited. Refer to <a href="auditing-access-to-private-objects.html">Auditing Access to Private Objects</a> for a description of this.</p>

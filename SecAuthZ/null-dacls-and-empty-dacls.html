<h1>Null DACLs and Empty DACLs (Authorization)</h1>
<p>If the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly"><em>discretionary access control list</em></a> (DACL) that belongs to an object's <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security descriptor</em></a> is set to <strong>NULL</strong>, a null DACL is created. A null DACL grants full access to any user that requests it; normal security checking is not performed with respect to the object. A null DACL should not be confused with an empty DACL. An empty DACL is a properly allocated and initialized DACL that contains no <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>access control entries</em></a> (ACEs). An empty DACL grants no access to the object it is assigned to.</p>
<p>For an example of how to create a DACL, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SecBP/creating-a-dacl">Creating a DACL</a>.</p>

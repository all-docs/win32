<h1>DACLs and ACEs</h1>
<p>If a Windows object does not have a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly"><em>discretionary access control list</em></a> (DACL), the system allows everyone full access to it. If an object has a DACL, the system allows only the access that is explicitly allowed by the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>access control entries</em></a> (ACEs) in the DACL. If there are no ACEs in the DACL, the system does not allow access to anyone. Similarly, if a DACL has ACEs that allow access to a limited set of users or groups, the system implicitly denies access to all trustees not included in the ACEs.</p>
<p>In most cases, you can control access to an object by using access-allowed ACEs; you do not need to explicitly deny access to an object. The exception is when an ACE allows access to a group and you want to deny access to a member of the group. To do this, place an access-denied ACE for the user in the DACL ahead of the access-allowed ACE for the group. Note that the <a href="order-of-aces-in-a-dacl.html">order of the ACEs</a> is important because the system reads the ACEs in sequence until access is granted or denied. The user's access-denied ACE must appear first; otherwise, when the system reads the group's access allowed ACE, it will grant access to the restricted user.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows a DACL that denies access to one user and grants access to two groups. The members of Group A get Read, Write, and Execute access rights by accumulating the rights allowed to Group A and rights allowed to Everyone. The exception is Andrew, who is denied access by the access-denied ACE in spite of being a member of the Everyone Group.</p>

<h1>Authorization Manager Model</h1>
<p>Authorization Manager provides a flexible framework for integrating role-based access control into applications. It enables administrators who use those applications to provide access through assigned user roles that relate to job functions.</p>
<p>Authorization Manager applications store authorization policy in the form of authorization stores that are stored in Active Directory or XML files and apply authorization policy at run time.</p>
<p>Applications then call a run-time access check method that checks access against the policy information in the authorization store.</p>
<p>Authorization policy includes the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="policy-stores--applications--and-scopes.html">Policy Stores, Applications, and Scopes</a></li>
<li><a href="users-and-groups.html">Users and Groups</a></li>
<li><a href="operations-and-tasks.html">Operations and Tasks</a></li>
<li><a href="roles.html">Roles</a></li>
<li><a href="business-rules.html">Business Rules</a></li>
<li><a href="collections.html">Collections</a></li>
</ul>

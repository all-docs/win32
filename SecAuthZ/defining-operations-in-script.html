<h1>Defining Operations in Script</h1>
<p>In Authorization Manager an operation is a low-level function or method of an application. These operations are grouped together as tasks. Users of the application request permission to complete tasks. An operation is represented by an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Azroles/nn-azroles-iazoperation"><strong>IAzOperation</strong></a> object. For more information about operations, see <a href="operations-and-tasks.html">Operations and Tasks</a>.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to define operations in an authorization policy store. The example assumes that there is an existing XML policy store named MyStore.xml in the root directory of drive C, and that this store contains an application named Expense.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>'  Create the AzAuthorizationStore object.
Dim AzManStore
Set AzManStore = CreateObject(&quot;AzRoles.AzAuthorizationStore&quot;)

'  Initialize the authorization store.
AzManStore.Initialize 2, &quot;msxml://C:\MyStore.xml&quot;

'  Open the application object in the store.
Dim expenseApp
Set expenseApp= AzManStore.OpenApplication(&quot;Expense&quot;)

'  Create operations.

'  Create first operation.
Dim Op1
Set Op1 = expenseApp.CreateOperation(&quot;RetrieveForm&quot;)

'  Set the OperationID property.
Op1.OperationID = 1

'  Save the operation to the store.
Op1.Submit

'  Create second operation.
Dim Op2
Set Op2 = expenseApp.CreateOperation(&quot;EnqueRequest&quot;)

'  Set the OperationID property.
Op2.OperationID = 2

'  Save the operation to the store.
Op2.Submit

'  Create third operation.
Dim Op3
Set Op3 = expenseApp.CreateOperation(&quot;DequeRequest&quot;)

'  Set the OperationID property.
Op3.OperationID = 3

'  Save the operation to the store.
Op3.Submit

'  Create fourth operation.
Dim Op4
Set Op4 = expenseApp.CreateOperation(&quot;UseFormControl&quot;)

'  Set the OperationID property.
Op4.OperationID = 4

'  Save the operation to the store.
Op4.Submit

'  Create fifth operation.
Dim Op5
Set Op5 = expenseApp.CreateOperation(&quot;MarkFormApproved&quot;)

'  Set the OperationID property.
Op5.OperationID = 5

'  Save the operation to the store.
Op5.Submit

'  Create sixth operation.
Dim Op6
Set Op6 = expenseApp.CreateOperation(&quot;SendApprovalNotify&quot;)

'  Set the OperationID property.
Op6.OperationID = 6

'  Save the operation to the store.
Op6.Submit

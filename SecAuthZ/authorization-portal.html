<p>Microsoft authorization technologies include Authorization Manager and the Authz API.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>Microsoft authorization technologies are intended for use by developers of applications based on the Windows Server and Windows operating systems that control access to resources. Developers should be familiar with Windows-based programming. Although not required, an understanding of authorization or security-related subjects is advised.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.</p>

<h1>Role-based Access Control</h1>
<p>The Authorization Manager API and MMC snap-in provide applications with a role-based access control framework. The Authorization Manager API, also known as AzMan, provides a simplified development model in which to manage flexible groups and business rules and store authorization policies. For more information, see the following topics:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ XP:</strong> The Authorization Manager API and MMC snap-in are available as a download (Windows ServerÂ 2003 Administration Tools Pack) from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/">https://www.microsoft.com/downloads</a>. This download supports administration and development of Authorization Manager policies; it does not support deployment of applications that use Authorization Manager to control access.</p>

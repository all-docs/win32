<h1>Standard Access Rights</h1>
<p>Each type of securable object has a set of access rights that correspond to operations specific to that type of object. In addition to these object-specific access rights, there is a set of standard access rights that correspond to operations common to most types of securable objects.</p>
<p>The <a href="access-mask-format.html">access mask format</a> includes a set of bits for the standard access rights. The following Windows constants for standard access rights are defined in Winnt.h.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Constant</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>DELETE</td>
<td>The right to delete the object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>READ_CONTROL</td>
<td>The right to read the information in the object's <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security descriptor</em></a>, not including the information in the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>system access control list</em></a> (SACL).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SYNCHRONIZE</td>
<td>The right to use the object for synchronization. This enables a thread to wait until the object is in the signaled state. Some object types do not support this access right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WRITE_DAC</td>
<td>The right to modify the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly"><em>discretionary access control list</em></a> (DACL) in the object's security descriptor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WRITE_OWNER</td>
<td>The right to change the owner in the object's security descriptor.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Winnt.h also defines the following combinations of the standard access rights constants.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Constant</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>STANDARD_RIGHTS_ALL</td>
<td>Combines DELETE, READ_CONTROL, WRITE_DAC, WRITE_OWNER, and SYNCHRONIZE access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STANDARD_RIGHTS_EXECUTE</td>
<td>Currently defined to equal READ_CONTROL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STANDARD_RIGHTS_READ</td>
<td>Currently defined to equal READ_CONTROL.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</td>
<td>Combines DELETE, READ_CONTROL, WRITE_DAC, and WRITE_OWNER access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>STANDARD_RIGHTS_WRITE</td>
<td>Currently defined to equal READ_CONTROL.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

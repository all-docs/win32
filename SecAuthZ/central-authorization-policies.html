<h1>Central Authorization Policies</h1>
<p>A Central Authorization Policy (CAP) collects the specific authorization rules (CAPRs) into a single policy. To allow the specific authorization rules (CAPRs) to be combined into the holistic authorization policy of the organization, CAPRs can be referenced together and applied to a set of resources. This is done by collecting multiple (by reference) into a CAP. Once a CAP is defined it can be distributed consumed by resource managers to apply the organizations authorization policy to resources.</p>
<p>A CAP has the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collection of CAPRs â€“ a list of references to existing CAPR objects</li>
<li>An identifier (Sid)</li>
<li>Description</li>
<li>Name</li>
</ul>
<p>A CAP is evaluated during access evaluation for files and folders on which an administrator enables it. During an <a href="/windows/win32/api/securitybaseapi/nf-securitybaseapi-accesscheck"><strong>AccessCheck</strong></a> call, the CAP check is logically combined with the discretionary ACL check; this means that in order to obtain access to a file to which the CAP applies, a user needs to have access both according to the CAP (its associated CAPRs) and the discretionary ACL on the file.</p>
<p>Example CAP:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>CORPORATE-FINANCE-CAP]
CAPID=S-1-5-3-4-56-45-67-123
Policies=HBI-CAPE;RETENTION-CAPR
</code></pre>
<h2>CAP Definition</h2>
<p>A CAP is created and edited in Active Directory using a new UX in ADAC (or PowerShell) that allows the administrator to create a CAP and specify a set of CAPRs that make up the CAP.</p>

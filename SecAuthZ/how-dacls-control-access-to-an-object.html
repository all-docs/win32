<h1>How AccessCheck Works</h1>
<p>When a thread tries to access a securable object, the system either grants or denies access. If the object does not have a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly"><em>discretionary access control list</em></a> (DACL), the system grants access; otherwise, the system looks for <a href="access-control-entries.html">Access Control Entries</a> (ACEs) in the object's DACL that apply to the thread. Each ACE in the object's DACL specifies the access rights allowed or denied for a <a href="trustees.html">trustee</a>, which can be a user account, a group account, or a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>logon session</em></a>.</p>
<h2>DACLs</h2>
<p>The system compares the trustee in each ACE to the trustees identified in the thread's <a href="access-tokens.html">access token</a>. An access token contains <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security identifiers</em></a> (SIDs) that identify the user and the group accounts to which the user belongs. A token also contains a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>logon SID</em></a> that identifies the current logon session. During an access check, the system ignores group SIDs that are not enabled. For more information on enabled, disabled, and deny-only SIDs, see <a href="sid-attributes-in-an-access-token.html">SID Attributes in an Access Token</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, the system uses the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly"><em>primary access token</em></a> of the thread that is requesting access. However, if the thread is impersonating another user, the system uses the thread's <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/i-gly"><em>impersonation token</em></a>.</p>
<p>The system examines each ACE in sequence until one of the following events occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>An access-denied ACE explicitly denies any of the requested <a href="access-rights-and-access-masks.html">access rights</a> to one of the trustees listed in the thread's access token.</li>
<li>One or more access-allowed ACEs for trustees listed in the thread's access token explicitly grant all the requested access rights.</li>
<li>All ACEs have been checked and there is still at least one requested access right that has not been explicitly allowed, in which case, access is implicitly denied.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows how an object's DACL can allow access to one thread while denying access to another.</p>
<p><img src="images/accctrl1.png" alt="dacl that grants different access rights to different threads" /></p>
<p>For Thread A, the system reads ACE 1 and immediately denies access because the access-denied ACE applies to the user in the thread's access token. In this case, the system does not check ACEs 2 and 3. For Thread B, ACE 1 does not apply, so the system proceeds to ACE 2, which allows write access, and ACE 3 which allows read and execute access.</p>
<p>Because the system stops checking ACEs when the requested access is explicitly granted or denied, the order of ACEs in a DACL is important. Note that if the ACE order were different in the example, the system might have granted access to Thread A. For system objects, the operating system defines a preferred <a href="order-of-aces-in-a-dacl.html">order of ACEs in a DACL</a>.</p>

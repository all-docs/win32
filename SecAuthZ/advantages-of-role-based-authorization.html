<h1>Advantages of Role-based Authorization</h1>
<p>The Authorization Manager API provides an authorization model that has several advantages over low-level (ACL-based) authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplifies access control administration.</li>
<li>Makes authorization available to scripts and applications developed using the Microsoft Visual Basic development system.</li>
<li>Provides a mechanism to apply run-time business logic when checking access.</li>
</ul>

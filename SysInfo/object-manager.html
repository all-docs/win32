<h1>Object Manager</h1>
<p>An object consists of a standard header and object-specific attributes. Because all objects have the same structure, there is a single object manager in Windows that maintains all objects.</p>
<p>The object header includes items such as the object name, so that other processes can reference the object by name, and a security descriptor, so that the object manager can control which processes access the system resource.</p>
<p>The tasks that the object manager performs include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating objects</li>
<li>Verifying that a process has the right to use the object</li>
<li>Creating object handles and returning them to the caller</li>
<li>Maintaining resource quotas</li>
<li>Creating duplicate handles</li>
<li>Closing handles to objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Â </p>

<h1>Registry</h1>
<p>The <em>registry</em> is a system-defined database in which applications and system components store and retrieve configuration data. The data stored in the registry varies according to the version of Microsoft Windows. Applications use the registry API to retrieve, modify, or delete registry data.</p>
<p>You should not edit registry data that does not belong to your application unless it is absolutely necessary. If there is an error in the registry, your system may not function properly. If this happens, you can restore the registry to the state it was in when you last started the computer successfully. For more information, see the help for your operating system.</p>
<p>For more information on the registry database and programmatic access to the registry data, see the following topics:</p>

<h1>Categories of Data</h1>
<p>Before putting data into the registry, an application should divide the data into two categories: computer-specific data and user-specific data. By making this distinction, an application can support multiple users, and yet locate user-specific data over a network and use that data in different locations, allowing location-independent user profile data. (A user profile is a set of configuration data saved for every user.)</p>
<p>When the application is installed, it should record the computer-specific data under the <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong> key. In particular, it should create keys for the company name, product name, and version number, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p>**HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\**<em>MyCompany\MyProduct\1.0</em></p>
<p>If the application supports COM, it should record that data under <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes</strong>.</p>
<p>An application should record user-specific data under the <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</strong> key, as shown in the following example:</p>
<p>**HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\**<em>MyCompany\MyProduct\1.0</em></p>

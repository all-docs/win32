<h1>Terminate a Session</h1>
<p>Session termination may originate with a user request, remote disconnection by the other party, or for application-specific reasons. When a session is terminated, the <a href="session-identifier-ovr.html">session identifier</a> remains valid until specifically released and can be used to gather post-connection data.</p>
<p>Session termination is completed by deallocating and releasing the resources associated with the session. If a session is merely dropped or disconnected but resources are not released, the result is a memory leak in the application and possibly in the service provider as well.</p>
<p><strong>TAPI 2.x:</strong> See <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linedrop"><strong>lineDrop</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linedeallocatecall"><strong>lineDeallocateCall</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>TAPI 3.x:</strong> See <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol-disconnect"><strong>ITBasicCallControl::Disconnect</strong></a>, perform a standard COM release on the Call object pointer.</p>

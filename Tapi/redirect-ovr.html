<h1>Redirect</h1>
<p>Session redirection allows an application to deflect an offered session to another address without answering the call. The application can do redirection on a call-by-call basis. For example, an application might allow a user to specify different redirections based on caller ID information. After a call has been successfully redirected, the state typically transitions to idle and associated resources must be released.</p>
<p>Redirect differs from <a href="forward-ovr.html">forward</a> in that once forwarding has been set up, the operation is performed by TAPI, the service provider, or the switch without further involvement of the application. Redirect differs from <a href="transfer-ovr.html">transfer</a> in that redirect does not require answering the call first.</p>
<p>Not all service providers support use of this operation.</p>
<p><strong>TAPI 2.x:</strong> See <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-lineredirect"><strong>lineRedirect</strong></a>.</p>

<h1>Telephony Service Provider Interface (TSPI)</h1>
<p>A Telephony Service Provider (TSPI) handles device-specific controls for communications programming. A TSP must conform to the Telephony Service Provider (TSPI) in order to function as a service provider within the Microsoft Telephony environment. TSPI defines the external functions exposed by a telephony service provider supplied with communications equipment.</p>
<p>A TSP author must be familiar with the material in <a href="./microsoft-telephony-overview.html">Microsoft Telephony Overview</a>, which covers general telephony architecture and provides an overview of material common to several telephony APIs. For example, this section contains a list of session control operations, such as Park, with descriptions of each operation and jumps to related TAPI 2.2, TAPI 3, and TSPI programming elements.</p>
<p>The following overviews cover material specific to the needs of a TSP author. Please note that the most difficult parts of writing a TSP are device-and operating-system-specific details, which are outside the scope of this document.</p>
<p>The TSPI overview is divided into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725196(v=vs.85)">General Programming Considerations</a> covers DLL requirements, proper handling of versions, error checks performed by TAPI, a summary of how TSPI functions correspond to TAPI 2.2 (TAPI/C) functions, and a discussion of levels of service as expressed in TSPI.</li>
<li>The <a href="life-cycle-of-a-telephony-service-provider.html">Life Cycle of a Telephony Service Provider</a> contains a high-level summary of a TSP's operational phases.</li>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725183(v=vs.85)">Device Access</a> covers the basics of how a TSP exposes device information and controls to TAPI.</li>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725266(v=vs.85)">Session Access</a> covers what TAPI expects of a TSP during a communications session.</li>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725240(v=vs.85)">Media Access</a> provides a limited set of controls over media streams. Much finer control is possible through use of a media service provider, and service provider authors should use this API whenever feasible. The TSPI provides for communications between a TSP/MSP pair.</li>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725257(v=vs.85)">Phone Devices</a> covers the supplemental information and operations exposed if a TSP handles phone set control. These operations are optional.</li>
<li><a href="the-telephony-service-provider-ui-dll-interface.html">The Telephony Service Provider UI DLL Interface</a> cover special functions that can be implemented to allow a user to directly set many aspects of a TSP's functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see the <a href="tspi-reference.html">TSPI Reference</a> for details of the TSPI programming elements.</p>

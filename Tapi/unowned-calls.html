<h1>Unowned Calls</h1>
<p>To prevent unowned calls from being in the telephony system, TAPI drops calls that have been signaled up from a service provider if it cannot identify an application to be the initial owner of the call. In TAPI version 2.0 and later, TAPI calls the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tspi/nf-tspi-tspi_linedrop"><strong>TSPI_lineDrop</strong></a> function to drop the call.</p>
<p>The service provider can know in advance whether or not there is an application available to take ownership of a new call. TAPI always informs the service provider of the media types for which there is an application available by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tspi/nf-tspi-tspi_linesetdefaultmediadetection"><strong>TSPI_lineSetDefaultMediaDetection</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>For example, if a service provider determines that there is an active call on the line having LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE mode, it should check the default media detection before generating the <a href="line-newcall.html"><strong>LINE_NEWCALL</strong></a> and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms725219(v=vs.85)"><strong>LINE_CALLSTATE</strong></a> messages. If the default media detection shows that no application is looking for a LINEMEDIAMODE_INTERACTIVEVOICE call, the service provider should not send the messages because TAPI will immediately drop it.</p>

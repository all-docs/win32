<h1>Primary Initialization</h1>
<p>A TAPI application must call an initialization operation, which prompts a series of actions from TAPI and the service providers that set up the communication environment for the application.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initialization is synchronous and does not return until the operation is complete or has failed.</li>
<li>If TAPISRV is not already running, TAPI starts it.</li>
<li>TAPI sets up a connection to the TAPISRV process.</li>
<li>TAPISVR loads the service providers specified in the registry and prompts them to initialize the devices they support.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TAPI 2.x:</strong> Applications perform initialization by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-lineinitializeexa"><strong>lineInitializeEx</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>TAPI 3.x:</strong> Applications call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-ittapi-initialize"><strong>ITTAPI::Initialize</strong></a>.</p>

<h1>Opening and Closing Phone Devices</h1>
<p>After determining the capabilities of a phone device, an application must open the device before it can access functions on that phone. After a phone device has been successfully opened, the application is returned a handle representing the open phone. A phone device can be opened in different modes, thus providing a structured way of sharing a phone device.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-phoneopen"><strong>phoneOpen</strong></a> function opens the specified phone device to give the application access to functions on the phone. A phone device is identified to <strong>phoneOpen</strong> by means of its device identifier, which is passed as the <em>dwDeviceID</em> parameter.</p>

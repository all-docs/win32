<h1>About the Media Service Provider (MSP)</h1>
<p>A TAPI 3 media service provider (MSP) allows an application considerable control over the media for a particular transport mechanism. An MSP always exists paired with a Telephony Service Provider (TSP). Just as a TSP is an abstraction layer for call control, the MSP controls media without need for device-specific coding. For an example of MSP/TSP communication, see <a href="./tapi-service-provider-overview.html">TAPI Service Provider Overview</a>.</p>
<p>An MSP enables media control through the use of special terminal, stream, and substream interfaces defined by TAPI. The diagram in <a href="about-call-and-media-controls.html">About Call and Media Controls</a> illustrates how these interfaces appear to a TAPI 3 application.</p>
<p>In addition, an MSP may implement private <a href="provider-specific-interfaces.html">provider-specific interfaces</a>, which TAPI will aggregate onto the standard objects exposed to an application. For example, the Microsoft IPConf MSP, which is installed with Microsoft WindowsÂ 2000, implements the <a href="itparticipant.html"><strong>ITParticipant</strong></a> interface, which provides controls for individual members of a conference.</p>
<p>The following topic briefly describes the MSPs that may be installed with a Microsoft operating system. For details on configuration and usage, see the resource kit for the target platform.</p>
<p>Additional third-party media service providers can be written for particular protocols or for physical devices. The <a href="media-service-provider-interface-mspi-.html">Media Service Provider Interface (MSPI)</a> describes the interfaces that must be implemented to allow an MSP to interact with the components of Microsoft Telephony.</p>

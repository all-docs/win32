<h1>Generating Inband Digits and Tones</h1>
<p>After a call is in the <em>connected</em> state, information can be transmitted over it. Two functions are provided that allow end-to-end inband signaling between the application and remote station equipment such as an answering machine. One function is <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-linegeneratedigits"><strong>lineGenerateDigits</strong></a>, which generates inband digits on a call, signaling them over the voice channel. Digits can be signaled as either rotary/pulse sequences or as DTMF tones. The other function is <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-linegeneratetone"><strong>lineGenerateTone</strong></a>, which enables the application to generate one of a variety of multifrequency tones inband (over the media stream). This generates telephony tones, such as ringback, beep, and busy, as well as arbitrary multifrequency, multicadenced tones.</p>
<p>Only one digit or tone generation can be in progress on a call at any one time. When digit or tone generation completes, a <a href="line-generate.html"><strong>LINE_GENERATE</strong></a> message is sent to the application that requested the generation. In the case where multiple digits are generated, only a single message is sent back after all digits have been generated. Calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-linegeneratedigits"><strong>lineGenerateDigits</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-linegeneratetone"><strong>lineGenerateTone</strong></a> while digit or tone generation is in progress will abort the generation currently in progress and send the LINE_GENERATE message to the application whose generation was aborted with a cancel indication.</p>

<h1>Using Call Center Controls</h1>
<p>Call center controls extend the TAPI 3 object model to support the requirements of Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) systems. A call center is a location with agents or operators at banks of telephones either making outgoing telephone calls or fielding incoming ones. For example, a bank or credit card company will use a call center to process account inquiries.</p>
<p>Call center applications are divided into three basic types:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="acd-proxy.html">ACD Proxy</a>: Handles incoming or outgoing sessions at the server, which can be anything from a proprietary telephone switch to an Internet gateway.</li>
<li><a href="acd-agent-client.html">ACD Agent Client</a>: Services an individual agent who is receiving or making calls.</li>
<li>ACD Supervisor Client: Provides an overall view of agent and ACD operations.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
For WindowsÂ 2000, proxy functionality is available using TAPI 2.2, and supervisor functions are not implemented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The samples section of the Windows SDK contains ACD code samples under Netds\Tapi\Tapi2\Acd and Netds\Tapi\Tapi3\Acd.</p>

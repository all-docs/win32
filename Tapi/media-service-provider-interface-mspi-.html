<h1>Media Service Provider Interface (MSPI)</h1>
<p>The Media Service Provider Interface (MSPI) is a set of interfaces and methods implemented by an MSP to allow a TAPI 3 application control over media transport during a communications session. An MSP handles the device-specific and protocol-specific mechanisms needed to enact these controls, and communicates with its paired TSP or an application through use of the methods provided in the MSPI.</p>
<p>The following section ( <a href="media-service-provider-interface-mspi-reference.html">Media Service Provider Interface (MSPI) Reference</a>) details the interfaces an MSP exposes in order to interact with the Microsoft Telephony environment.</p>
<p>In addition, an MSP may expose provider-specific private interfaces and methods to further assist in media control. For example, the <a href="ipconf-msp.html">IP Conference MSP</a> exposes interfaces that provide participant control. See <a href="provider-specific-interfaces.html">Provider-Specific Interfaces</a> for information on how private objects work and <a href="ipconf-msp-interfaces.html">IPConf MSP Interfaces</a> for a reference listing of IPConf.</p>
<p>The majority of the programming effort in creating an MSP is highly specific to a given platform, device, and transport protocol, and is outside the scope of this document. However, Microsoft supplies a set of MSP base classes, which will be useful to most MSP authors. See <a href="tapi-3-msp-base-classes.html">TAPI 3 MSP Base Classes</a> for information on using these classes.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msp/nn-msp-itmspaddress"><strong>ITMSPAddress</strong></a> interface represents a media service provider to the TAPI DLL. This interface is not used by or exposed to an end-user application. The TAPI 3 DLL calls <strong>CoCreateInstance</strong> on this interface to create the main MSP object. Methods on this object allow an application to load and unload the MSP, receive information from a TSP, and create the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itstreamcontrol"><strong>ITStreamControl</strong></a> interface, which is exposed on the call object.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itsubstreamcontrol"><strong>ITSubStreamControl</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itsubstream"><strong>ITSubStream</strong></a> interfaces provide parallel methods with respect to substreams. Substream support is optional. All other interfaces must be implemented by an MSP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Operations implemented by a TSP/MSP pair must be located in one DLL to allow a user to update the service provider without rebooting his or her system.</p>

<h1>Telephony Application Programming Interfaces</h1>
<p>The Microsoft telephony application programming interfaces support the development of communications applications for Microsoft Windows. The telephony interfaces are listed in the following table.</p>
<table>

<th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="./tapi-2-2-start-page.html">TAPI 2.x</a></td>
<td>A C-programming language based API that enables you to implement communications applications ranging from basic modem control to call centers with multiple agents and switches.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="tapi-3-1-start-page.html">TAPI 3.x</a></td>
<td>A COM-based API that merges classic and IP telephony.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./telephony-service-providers-start-page.html">TSPI</a></td>
<td>A telephony service provider (TSP) is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that supports communications device control through a set of exported service functions. A TAPI application uses standardized commands, TAPI passes information to the telephony service provider, and the TSP handles the specific commands that must be exchanged with the device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="media-service-providers-start-page.html">MSPI</a></td>
<td>A media service provider (MSP) allows an application considerable control over the media for a particular transport mechanism. An MSP is always paired with a telephony service provider (TSP).</td>

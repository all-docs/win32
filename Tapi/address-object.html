<h1>Address Object</h1>
<p>The Address object represents an entity that can make or receive calls. This object exposes interfaces and methods that allow an application to perform a number of operations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discover whether a specified address can support a particular set of media type needs.</li>
<li>Enumerate calls currently associated with the address.</li>
<li>Create or forward calls.</li>
<li>Get the name of the associated service provider.</li>
<li>If a media service provider exists, get interface pointers that allow detailed terminal manipulation.</li>
<li>Get and set other information, such as whether a message is waiting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most addresses are associated with a terminal, but this is not uniformly the case. For example, a remote TSP that provides access to equipment on a server will have an address on the local machine but not a terminal. A speakerless modem also has no terminal associated with its address.</p>
<p>If an address does not have an associated terminal, the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itterminalsupport"><strong>ITTerminalSupport</strong></a> interface is not exposed on the object.</p>
<p>The <a href="select-an-address.html">Select an Address</a> code example shows the basic process for acquiring an address object pointer.</p>
<p>See <a href="address-object-interfaces.html">Address Object Interfaces</a> for a list of all interfaces associated with the Address object.</p>

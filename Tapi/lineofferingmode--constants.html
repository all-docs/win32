<h1>LINEOFFERINGMODE_ Constants</h1>
<p>The <strong>LINEOFFERINGMODE_</strong> bit-flag constants (TAPI versions 1.4 and later) describe different substates of an offering call. A mode is available as call status to the application after the call state trdansitions to offering, and within the <a href="line-callstate.html"><strong>LINE_CALLSTATE</strong></a> message indicating the call is in LINECALLSTATE_OFFERING. These values are used when the call is on an address that is shared (bridged) with other stations (see <a href="lineaddresssharing--constants.html"><strong>LINEADDRESSSHARING_ Constants</strong></a>), primarily electronic key systems.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Indicates that the call is alerting at the current station (will be accompanied by LINEDEVSTATE_RINGING messages), and if any application is set up to automatically answer, it can do so. If the call state mode is ZERO, the application should assume that the value is active (which would be the situation on a non-bridged address). (TAPI versions 1.4 and later)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>LINEOFFERINGMODE_INACTIVE</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Indicates that the call is being offered at more than one station, but the current station is not alerting (for example, it may be an attendant station where the offering status is advisory, such as blinking a light); software at the station set for automatic answering should preferably not answer the call, because this should be the prerogative at the primary (alerting) station, but <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-lineanswer"><strong>lineAnswer</strong></a> may be used to connect the call. (TAPI versions 1.4 and later)</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Not extensible. All 32 bits are reserved.</p>
<p>For backward compatibility, it is the responsibility of the service provider to examine the negotiated API version on the line, and to not use these LINEOFFERINGMODE_ values if they are not supported on the negotiated version. Applications that are not cognizant of LINEOFFERINGMODE_ will most likely assume that a call that is in LINECALLSTATE_OFFERING is in LINEOFFERINGMODE_ACTIVE.</p>
<p>The LINEOFFERINGMODE_ACTIVE and LINEOFFERINGMODE_INACTIVE values are used when the call is on an address that is shared with other stations (bridged; see <a href="lineaddresssharing--constants.html">LINEADDRESSSHARING_ Constants</a>), primarily electronic key systems. If the offering call state mode is &quot;active,&quot; it means that the call is alerting at the current station (will be accompanied by LINEDEVSTATE_RINGING messages), and if any application is set up to automatically answer, it can do so. If the call state mode is &quot;inactive,&quot; the call is being offered at more than one station, but the current station is not alerting (for example, it may be an attendant station where the offering status is advisory, such as blinking a light); software at the station set for automatic answering should preferably not answer the call, because this should be the prerogative at the primary (alerting) station, but <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-lineanswer"><strong>lineAnswer</strong></a> can be used to connect the call. If the call state mode is ZERO, the application should assume that the value is active (which would be the situation on a non-bridged address).</p>

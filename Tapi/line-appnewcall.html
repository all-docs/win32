<h1>LINE_APPNEWCALL message</h1>
<p>The TAPI <strong>LINE_APPNEWCALL</strong> message is sent to inform an application when a new call handle has been spontaneously created on its behalf (other than through an API call from the application, in which case the handle would have been returned through a pointer parameter passed into the function).</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>        
</code></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>hDevice</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The application's handle to the line device on which the call has been created.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>dwCallbackInstance</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The callback instance supplied when opening the call's line.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>dwParam1</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Identifier of the address on the line on which the call appears. An address identifier is permanently associated with an address; the identifier remains constant across operating system upgrades.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>dwParam2</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The application's handle to the new call.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>dwParam3</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The applications privilege to the new call (LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER or LINECALLPRIVILEGE_MONITOR).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>No return value.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Applications supporting TAPI version 2.0 or later are sent a <strong>LINE_APPNEWCALL</strong> message whenever the application is spontaneously given a handle to a new call. Because the message includes the <em>hLine</em> and <em>dwAddressID</em> parameters on which the call exists, the application can readily create a new call object in the correct context. The <strong>LINE_APPNEWCALL</strong> message is always immediately followed by a <a href="line-callstate.html"><strong>LINE_CALLSTATE</strong></a> message indicating the initial state of the call.</p>
<p>Older applications (that negotiated an API version earlier than 2.0) are sent only a <a href="line-callstate.html"><strong>LINE_CALLSTATE</strong></a> message, as documented in previous versions of the API. Such applications would create a new call object upon receiving a <a href="line-callstate.html"><strong>LINE_CALLSTATE</strong></a> message that has <em>dwParam3</em> set to a nonzero value and containing a call handle not presently known by the application. The disadvantages are that (a) the application must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-linegetcallinfo"><strong>lineGetCallInfo</strong></a> to determine the <em>hLine</em> and <em>dwAddressID</em> parameters associated with the call; (b) the application must scan all known call handles to determine that the call is a new call; and (c) it is possible, under certain conditions, for the application to think it is receiving a new call handle when in reality it has just deallocated its handle to the call (for example, the application has just deallocated a call handle, but a <a href="line-callstate.html"><strong>LINE_CALLSTATE</strong></a> message giving the application ownership of the call due to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-linehandoff"><strong>lineHandoff</strong></a> from another application was already in the application's TAPI message queue).</p>

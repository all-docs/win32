<h1>TAPI DLL</h1>
<p>The TAPI DLLs, along with the TAPI Server (Tapisvr.exe), are crucial abstractions separating end-user or server applications from service providers. A TAPI DLL in conjunction with the TAPI Server provides a consistent interface between these two layers.</p>
<p>A TAPI application loads the appropriate DLL into its process space. During initialization, TAPI establishes an RPC link with Tapisvr.exe. The TAPI Server runs in the context of SVCHOST.</p>
<p>There are three DLLs associated with TAPI: Tapi.dll, Tapi32.dll, and Tapi3.dll. These DLLs are located in %SystemRoot%\system32. The following figure illustrates the roles of their respective roles in Microsoft Telephony:</p>

<p>Existing 16-bit applications link to Tapi.dll. Tapi.dll is simply a thunk layer that maps 16-bit addresses to 32-bit addresses and pass requests to Tapi32.dll.</p>
<p>Existing 32-bit TAPI 2.x applications link to Tapi32.dll. Tapi32.dll is a thin marshalling layer that transfers function requests to the TAPI Server (TAPISRV) and, when needed, loads and invokes media service provider DLLs in the application's process.</p>
<p>TAPI 3.x applications link to Tapi3.dll.</p>

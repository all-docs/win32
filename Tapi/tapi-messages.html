<h1>TAPI Messages</h1>
<p>Messages are used to notify the application of asynchronous events. All of these messages are sent to the application through the message notification mechanism that the application specified in <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-lineinitializeexa"><strong>lineInitializeEx</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The message always contains a handle to the relevant object (phone, line, or call), which the application can use to determine the message type.</p>
<p>Certain messages are used to notify the application about a change in an object's status. These messages provide the object handle and give an indication of which status item has changed. The application can call the appropriate &quot;get status&quot; function of the object to obtain the object's full status.</p>
<p>When an event occurs, messages can be sent to zero, one, or more applications. The target applications for a message are determined by a number of different factors including the meaning of the message, the application's privilege to the object, whether or not the application initiated the request for which the message is a direct result, and the message masking that has been set by the application. Note the following points about messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous reply messages are only sent to the application that originated the request and cannot be masked.</li>
<li>Messages that signal the completion of digit or tone generation or the gathering of digits are only sent to the application that requested the digit or tone generation.</li>
<li>Messages that indicate line or address state changes are sent to all applications that have opened the line, so long as the message has been enabled through <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-linesetstatusmessages"><strong>lineSetStatusMessages</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Messages that indicate call state and call information changes are sent to all applications that have a handle to the call.</li>
<li>Messages that signal a digit detection, tone detection, or media type detection are sent to the applications that requested monitoring of that event.</li>
</ul>

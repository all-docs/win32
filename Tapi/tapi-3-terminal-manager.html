<h1>TAPI 3 Terminal Manager</h1>
<p>The TAPI 3 Terminal Manager is created by Tapi3.dll at the request of an MSP, and is used by the MSP for tasks such as the creation and deletion of dynamic terminals.</p>
<p>The precise implementation details for an MSP's dynamic terminals are beyond the scope of this documentation. However, many authors may choose to use some of the capabilities of the Media Streaming Terminal (MST). This terminal is based on DirectShow and filters specific to a given protocol may be written and used in conjunction with the MST.</p>

<h1>CallHub Support</h1>
<p>CallHub tracking is a new feature in TAPI version 3.0. CallHub functionality was added to the TAPI 2.1 programming elements with the delivery of WindowsÂ 2000. A <em>CallHub</em> represents a third-party view of a call, and TAPI's call handles represent the first-party view of a call. With CallHub tracking, the service provider is requested to follow CallHubs and give information about the call during the lifetime of a CallHub. As new parties join and leave the CallHub, the service provider should inform TAPI.</p>
<p>A service provider does not need to implement any new functions in order to support CallHub. It simply needs to fill in the <strong>dwCallID</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/ns-tapi-linecallinfo"><strong>LINECALLINFO</strong></a> structure. In TAPI 3, TAPI collects all calls with the same <strong>dwCallID</strong> and creates a CallHub handle that the application can use to track the call.</p>

<h1>Stream Objects</h1>
<p>Stream objects are an abstraction of the media stream or streams associated with a call session. The interfaces and methods exposed on stream and substream objects allow an application to exercise very detailed controls such as pausing a stream, adding new media types to a communications session, or adjusting the audio volume of a particular conference participant.</p>
<p>The two main types of stream are the stream and the substream. The interfaces and methods of a standard implementation are similar for both, but substreaming allowing a lower level of control. All media service providers (MSPs) must implement the basic stream control interfaces, but support for substreams is optional.</p>
<p>In addition, some service providers implement <a href="provider-specific-interfaces.html">provider-specific interfaces</a> for streams. For example, the IPConf MSP provides participant level controls. See <a href="ipconf-msp-interfaces.html">IPConf MSP Interfaces</a> for a summary. For other interfaces that might be implemented, see the service provider's documentation.</p>
<p>The MSP and TAPI create stream objects for a call during initial setup of an outgoing or incoming session. The application is responsible for identifying appropriate terminals for these streams, and selecting the terminals onto the streams.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases an MSP may require that the application stop or pause streams prior to certain call session operations.</p>
<p>The stream interfaces are documented in the <a href="media-service-provider-interface-mspi-reference.html">Media Service Provider Interface (MSPI) Reference</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="select-a-terminal.html">Select a Terminal</a> code example shows an example of enumerating streams and selecting terminals onto them.</p>

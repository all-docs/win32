<h1>Supplementary Telephony Services</h1>
<p>Supplementary Telephony services are the collection of all the services defined by the API other than those included in the Basic Telephony subset. It includes all so-called supplementary features found on modern PBXs, such as hold, transfer, conference, park, and so on. All supplementary features are considered optional; that is, the service provider decides which of these services it does or does not provide.</p>
<p>An application can query a line or phone device for the set of supplementary services it provides using functions such as <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetdevcaps"><strong>lineGetDevCaps</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetaddresscaps"><strong>lineGetAddressCaps</strong></a>. A single supplementary service may consist of multiple function calls and messages. The Telephony API, and not the service provider developer, defines the behavior of each of these supplementary features. A service provider should provide a Supplementary Telephony service only if it can implement the exact meaning as defined by the API. If not, the feature should be provided as an Extended Telephony service.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Basic Telephony services, phone-device services are considered optional. Therefore, all phone-device services are part of Supplementary Telephony. For a list of the functions of Supplementary Telephony, see <a href="./tapi-quick-function-reference.html">TAPI Quick Function Reference</a>.</p>

<h1>Synchronous Requests</h1>
<p>Service provider designers should try to keep the execution time of synchronous operations short. For example, there is an &quot;Open&quot; operation called at initialization time that prepares the service provider and TAPI for subsequent operations on a device. A service provider whose implementation is split between the client computer and a dedicated server may have reasonable confidence that it can communicate with its remote server. Its implementation of &quot;Open&quot; might just allocate and initialize data structures to represent the device and return, postponing end-to-end communication until some real operation is requested.</p>
<p>Any such &quot;optimistic&quot; implementation of a synchronous operation can later encounter resource limitations or remote communication failures. In general, even a &quot;conservative&quot; approach cannot entirely prevent these problems; service-provider designers must choose the best tradeoff between reliability and performance. A failure of this kind should be handled gracefully wherever possible. From the point of view of TSPI devices, they should remain valid for &quot;bookkeeping&quot; purposes even if they return failure status for any operation requested.</p>
<p>Implementing an optimistic approach for synchronous requests should not be done at the expense of correct semantics for the operation. Returning to the &quot;Open&quot; example, if opening a device needs to compete for and reserve a scarce, nonsharable resource such as communication ports, it should probably do so even if it is time-consuming.</p>
<p><strong>TAPI 2.x:</strong> An operation that completes synchronously performs all of its processing in the function call made by the application. The function returns different values depending on its success or failure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synchronous Success.</strong> If the request or service corresponding to the function has been carried out successfully, the function returns zero, indicating success. Any values written as a result of the function call are reliable and can be used immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Synchronous Failure.</strong> If the function detects an error and the request is not carried out, a negative error number is returned to identify the error.</li>
</ul>

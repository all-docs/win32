<h1>Lamps</h1>
<p>The lamps on a phone device can be lit in a variety of different lighting modes. Unlike ringing patterns, lamp modes are more uniform across phone sets of different vendors. A common set of lamp modes is defined by the API. A lamp identified by its lamp-button identifier can be lit in a given lamp mode. A lamp can also be queried for its current lamp mode.</p>
<p>The TAPI functions used for lamps are <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-phonesetlamp"><strong>phoneSetLamp</strong></a>, which lights a lamp on a specified open phone device in a given lamp lighting mode, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi/nf-tapi-phonegetlamp"><strong>phoneGetLamp</strong></a>, which returns the current lamp mode of the specified lamp.</p>
<p>When a lamp of a phone device is changed, a <a href="phone-state.html"><strong>PHONE_STATE</strong></a> message is sent to the application to notify the application about the state change. Parameters to this message provide an indication of the change.</p>

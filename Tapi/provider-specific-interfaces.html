<h1>Provider-Specific Interfaces</h1>
<p>TAPI 3 supports integration of service provider-specific interfaces into the standard objects, allowing applications to take advantage of provider-specific functionality. Additionally, TAPI 3 allows service providers to deliver vendor-specific events to applications as COM objects over the same interface on which the application receives standard events.</p>
<p>TAPI achieves this integration by aggregating provider-specific objects with the standard objects â€“ TAPI, Address, Terminal, Call, and CallHub â€“ and dispatching or delegating unknown methods to these provider-specific objects.</p>
<p>For example, a service provider may allow applications to obtain information about a call beyond what is exposed by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itcallinfo"><strong>ITCallInfo</strong></a> interface. The vendor must define an interface that allows applications to make these extra queries and implement that interface on an object. This object also implements a vendor information-querying interface so that an application can discover what sorts of provider-specific functions might be available.</p>
<p>When the application obtains a reference to a call object, the application can use the new provider-specific interface and its methods as if they were implemented by the call object itself.</p>
<p>See <a href="media-service-provider-interface-mspi-reference.html">Media Service Provider Interface (MSPI) Reference</a> for a list of all standard MSP interfaces.</p>

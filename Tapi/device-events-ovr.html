<h1>Device Events (Telephony API)</h1>
<p>TAPI responds to device changes such as a phone that has started ringing or a modem that has been removed by firing device events. A TAPI application should respond to a device event by querying for the specific change that has occurred and then taking appropriate action. An application may screen for events it will receive using <a href="event-notification.html">event notification</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TAPI 2.x:</strong> Applications receive notification of device events using the <a href="./line-linedevstate.html"><strong>LINE_LINEDEVSTATE</strong></a> message. The current status of an address is determined by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetaddressstatus"><strong>lineGetAddressStatus</strong></a>, which returns its information in a <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/ns-tapi-lineaddressstatus"><strong>LINEADDRESSSTATUS</strong></a> structure. The status of a specified open line device is obtained by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linegetlinedevstatus"><strong>lineGetLineDevStatus</strong></a>, which returns its information in a <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/ns-tapi-linedevstatus"><strong>LINEDEVSTATUS</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p><strong>TAPI 3.x:</strong> Applications receive an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tapi3if/ne-tapi3if-address_event"><strong>ADDRESS_EVENT</strong></a> notification, which is processed using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itaddressevent"><strong>ITAddressEvent</strong></a> interface. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itaddresscapabilities"><strong>ITAddressCapabilities</strong></a> can then be used to acquire more detail information.</p>

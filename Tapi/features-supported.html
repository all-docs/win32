<h1>Features Supported</h1>
<p>The following list contains the TAPI MSP supported features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implements an MSP that handles a single address per instance of the MSP. Multiple like addresses are handled by instantiating the MSP multiple times. This greatly simplifies the implementation of the MSP and the base classes.</li>
<li>Implements all the MSPI interfaces, including <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msp/nn-msp-itmspaddress"><strong>ITMSPAddress</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itterminalsupport"><strong>ITTerminalSupport</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itstreamcontrol"><strong>ITStreamControl</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itstream"><strong>ITStream</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Implements ready-to-use static terminals for both audio and video.</li>
<li>Implements generic terminal base classes. These terminal base classes are used by both the above-mentioned static terminal implementations and the implementations of dynamic terminals that are found in Termmgr.dll. The MSP can also use them to implement additional terminals.</li>
<li>Uses the Terminal Manager to handle dynamic terminals. Creates dynamic terminals on a worker thread with a message pump (to free console applications from having to process window messages for video render terminals and to simplify synchronization issues).</li>
<li>Supports calls that use a filter graph per stream.</li>
<li>Implements handling of graph events.</li>
<li>Uses the thread pooling APIs, in conjunction with a worker thread of its own, to handle events.</li>
<li>Uses the tracing APIs of WindowsÂ 2000 (originally developed for the Routing project) along with additional logic to provide a flexible, generic logging mechanism that can simultaneously log to any combination of the following: a user or kernel-mode debugger; a separate console window with log messages separated by component; a log file.</li>
<li>Runs free-threaded.</li>
</ul>

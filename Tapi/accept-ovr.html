<h1>Accept</h1>
<p>In some environments, a user is not automatically alerted to an offering call, such as by ringing or by a message on their computer screen. The accept operation starts the process of alerting (usually ringing), and the <a href="answer-ovr.html">answer</a> operation takes place afterward. The application may <a href="drop-ovr.html">drop</a> the session, <a href="redirect-ovr.html">redirect</a> it, or accept it.</p>
<p>If the current service provider supports it, the application has the option to send user-user information at the time of the accept. There is no guarantee that the network will deliver this information to the calling party.</p>
<p>Not all service providers support use of this operation.</p>

<h1>Track Terminals</h1>
<p>Two types of track terminals are defined: Recording Track Terminal and Playback Track Terminal, which, respectively, belong to and are managed by File Recording Terminal and File Playback Terminal.</p>
<p>All track terminals expose the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itfiletrack"><strong>ITFileTrack</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itterminal"><strong>ITTerminal</strong></a> interfaces. The <strong>ITTerminal</strong> interface allows the selection of track terminals onto streams or calls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Track terminals also expose a private interface, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itmediacontrol"><strong>ITMediaControl</strong></a>, which the MSP uses. Applications should not attempt to access this interface.</p>

<h1>File Terminals</h1>
<p>In TAPI 3.1, the terminal object is expanded to include a file terminal. File terminals provide a simple means to perform common operations, for example, recording an audio stream or streams to a file or subsequent playback of recorded audio to a stream.</p>
<p>Five basic objects are used to manipulate file terminals:</p>
<ul>
<li>File Playback Terminal</li>
<li>File Recording Terminal</li>
<li>File Playback Track</li>
<li>File Recording Track</li>
<li>File Event</li>
</ul>
<p>The File Terminal objects can be thought of as an abstraction for the storage, which is usually a file. Tracks correspond to the individual audio data streams in that storage, such as when voice is recorded.</p>

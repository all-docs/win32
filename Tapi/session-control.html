<h1>Session Control</h1>
<p>A session or call represents a connection between two or more addresses. This connection is dynamic, and the associated programming objects must be created, manipulated, and released as needed. In the simplest case, this means making and disconnecting a phone call. For advanced applications, session control may involve managing multimedia conferences over an IP network down to the level of individual participants.</p>
<p>Session control involves two basic areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="session-operations-ovr.html">Session Operations</a> are controls that initiate, maintain, and terminate a communications session.</li>
<li><a href="session-information-ovr.html">Session Information</a> describes data that can be obtained concerning a communications session.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two specialized types of session control are not covered in this section. For information on Automatic Call Distribution Centers, see <a href="./call-center-control.html">Call Center Control</a> (TAPI 2.x) or <a href="about-call-center-controls.html">About Call Center Controls</a> (TAPI 3.x).

<h1>CMSPArray</h1>
<p>The CMSPArray template implements a smart array that will grow on demand. It is designed to hold small arrays with simple data types. It doesn't have a critical section. Its only dependencies are <strong>realloc</strong> and <strong>memmove</strong>. It is used internally to keep lists of object pointers. It is similar to ATL's <strong>CSimpleArray</strong> implementation, but it is more efficient for initial allocations.</p>
<p>This template is defined in MSPutils.h.</p>

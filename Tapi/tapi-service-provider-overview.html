<h1>TAPI Service Provider Overview</h1>
<p>TAPI applications reside in their own process space. TAPI applications load the Tapi32.dll or Tapi3.dll into their process, and TAPI communicates with TAPISRV through a private RPC interface. A TSP runs in the context of TAPISRV. A given TSP may reside on a machine other than the user's machine and is accessed using a remote TSP. TAPISRV is implemented as a service process within SVCHOST. An MSP lives within the process space of the application and is always local.</p>
<p>A TSP/MSP pair can be regarded as having a virtual private communication path. Information can be sent between the two using opaque buffers that are not interpreted by either TAPISRV or the TAPI DLL.</p>
<p>Some service providers implement operations specific to the hardware involved. TAPI 2.x provides access to such operations through the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-linedevspecific"><strong>lineDevSpecific</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-phonedevspecific"><strong>phoneDevSpecific</strong></a> function. TAPI 3.x exposes <a href="./provider-specific-interfaces.html">provider-specific Interfaces</a>.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the flow of controls and information, showing one stand-alone TSP (Unimodem) and one TSP/MSP pair (H.323).</p>

<p>The following diagram illustrates the progress of an incoming call that involves both a TSP and an MSP.</p>
<p><img src="images/tspmspin.png" alt="incoming call with a tsp and an msp" /></p>
<h2>Incoming Call Setup</h2>
<ul>
<li>The TSP sends a <a href="line-newcall.html"><strong>LINE_NEWCALL</strong></a> message to TAPISRV. The <a href="./linecallstate--constants.html"><strong>call state</strong></a> is LINECALLSTATE_OFFERING.</li>
<li>TAPISRV notifies clients of the call.</li>
<li>TAPI3 creates the TAPI Call object, then calls <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3/nf-tapi3-itmspaddress-createmspcall"><strong>ITMSPAddress::CreateMSPCall</strong></a>, which is implemented by the MSP.</li>
<li>The MSP creates an MSP Call object and default streams based on the <a href="./tapimediatype--constants.html"><strong>media types</strong></a> required for the call. It returns an IUnknown pointer to the MSP call object.</li>
<li>TAPI3 aggregates the MSP Call object into the TAPI Call object, making interfaces such as <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itstreamcontrol"><strong>ITStreamControl</strong></a> available to the application. It then notifies the application of the new call.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application may then use methods such as <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itstream-selectterminal"><strong>ITStream::SelectTerminal</strong></a> to complete preparations for call completion.</p>
<h2>Incoming Call Completion</h2>
<ul>
<li>The application calls <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3if/nf-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol-answer"><strong>ITBasicCallControl::Answer</strong></a>.</li>
<li>TAPI3 calls <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi/nf-tapi-lineanswer"><strong>lineAnswer</strong></a>.</li>
<li>TAPISERV calls <a href="/windows/win32/api/tspi/nf-tspi-tspi_lineanswer"><strong>TSPI_lineAnswer</strong></a>.</li>
<li>The TSP initiates call streaming. Usually, the TSP sends a message to the corresponding MSP, and the MSP starts the streams. In some TSP/MSP implementations, the TSP starts the streams.</li>
</ul>
<h2>TSP/MSP Communication During Call Progress</h2>
<p>After the call is in progress, the TSP and the MSP communicate by passing opaque buffers through TAPISRV and TAPI3.</p>
<ul>
<li>The TSP sends information to the MSP by sending the <a href="line-sendmspdata.html"><strong>LINE_SENDMSPDATA</strong></a> message to TAPISRV.</li>
<li>The MSP receives information from the TSP through the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tapi3/nf-tapi3-itmspaddress-receivetspdata"><strong>ITMSPAddress::ReceiveTSPData</strong></a> method. If the data is related to a MSP call object, an interface pointer to the MSP call object is provided as a parameter of that method.</li>
<li>The MSP sends information to the TSP by sending a MSP_TSP_DATA event to TAPI 3.</li>
<li>The TSP receives information from the MSP through the <a href="/windows/win32/api/tspi/nf-tspi-tspi_linereceivemspdata"><strong>TSPI_lineReceiveMSPData</strong></a> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact process and content of communication between service providers is specific to a given TSP/MSP set.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
For outgoing calls, the MSP typically knows about the call before the TSP. If the MSP tries to communicate with the TSP before the TSP is informed about a call, the communication will fail. When the MSP and the TSP need to exchange information concerning a specific call, the TSP should initiate communication.</p>

<h1>Operating Modes and Privileges</h1>
<p>The application can request one of two operating modes when opening a phone device. These modes reflect the privileges the application requests for the device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening a phone for monitor privileges lets the application determine the status of the phone device. Messages are sent to the application when status changes on the phone device are detected.</li>
<li>An application that opens a phone device for owner privileges can use operations that modify the state of the phone device. Owner privilege automatically includes full monitor privileges as well. At any time, a given phone device can be open only once for owner privileges, but multiple times for monitor privileges. All <strong>phoneSet</strong> operations require owner privileges, while all <strong>phoneGet</strong> operations require only monitor privileges.</li>
</ul>

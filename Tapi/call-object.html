<h1>Call Object</h1>
<p>The Call object represents an address's connection between the local address and one or more other addresses. All call control is done through the Call object. <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itbasiccallcontrol"><strong>ITBasicCallControl</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/tapi3if/nn-tapi3if-itcallinfo"><strong>ITCallInfo</strong></a> are the most frequently used interfaces on the call object. These interfaces implement a variety of operations and queries, such as acquiring interface pointers for media streams or getting the caller ID. See the main overview sections on <a href="session-operations-ovr.html">Session Operations</a> and <a href="session-information-ovr.html">Session Information</a> for reviews of those supported by TAPI.</p>
<p>A media service provider can implement <a href="provider-specific-interfaces.html">provider-specific interfaces</a>, which are aggregated on a call object by TAPI. For detailed information on what a provider has implemented, see the service provider's documentation.</p>
<p>The <a href="make-a-call.html">Make a Call</a> and <a href="receive-a-call.html">Receive a Call</a> code examples show some illustrations of using a Call object.</p>
<p>See <a href="call-object-interfaces.html">Call Object Interfaces</a> for a list of all interfaces associated with the Call object.</p>

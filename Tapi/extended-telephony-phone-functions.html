<h1>Extended Telephony Phone Functions</h1>
<p>The Extended phone services (or Device-Specific phone services) include all extensions to the TAPI defined by the service provider. TAPI defines a mechanism that enables service-provider vendors to extend TAPI using device-specific extensions. TAPI defines only the extension mechanism, and by doing so provides access to device-specific extensions. TAPI does not define their behavior, which is completely defined by the service provider.</p>
<p>TAPI consists of scalar and bit-flag data constant definitions, data structures, functions, and messages. Procedures are defined that enable a vendor to extend most of these, as described in the following topics.</p>

<li><a href="bit-flag-data-constants.html">Bit-Flag Data Constants</a></li>
<li><a href="functions-and-messages.html">Functions and Messages</a></li>

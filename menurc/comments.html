<h1>Comments (Menus and Other Resources)</h1>
<p>RC supports C-style syntax for both single-line comments and block comments. Single-line comments begin with two forward slashes (//) and run to the end of the line. The following is an example of a resource statement followed by a single-line comment.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>NewCursor  CURSOR  NEW.CUR  // a new cursor for the application.
</code></pre>
<p>Block comments begin with an opening delimiter (/*) and run to a closing delimiter (*/). Comments do not nest. The following is an example of a block comment at the beginning of a .rc file.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>/* 
    Resources.Rc

    Contains the resource definitions for the application.
    Control identifiers are defined in Resources.h.
*/

#include &quot;resources.h&quot;
//...
</code></pre>

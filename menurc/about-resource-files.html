<h1>About Resource Files</h1>
<p>To include resources in your Windows-based application with RC, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create individual files for your cursors, icons, bitmaps, dialog boxes, and fonts.</li>
<li>Create a resource-definition script (.rc file) that describes the resources used by your application.</li>
<li>Compile the script with RC. For more information, see <a href="using-rc-the-rc-command-line-.html">Using RC (The RC Command Line)</a>.</li>
<li>Link the compiled resource (.res) file into the application's executable file with your linker.</li>
</ol>
<p>A resource file is a text file with the extension .rc. The file can use single-byte, double-byte, or Unicode characters. The syntax and semantics for the RC preprocessor are similar to those of the Microsoft C/C++ compiler. However, RC supports a subset of the preprocessor directives, defines, and pragmas in a script.</p>
<p>The script file defines resources. For a resource that exists in a separate file, such as an icon or cursor, the script specifies the resource and the file that contains it. For some resources, such as a menu, the entire definition of the resource exists within the script.</p>
<p>The following topics describe the information a script file can contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="comments.html">Comments</a>, which are notes to be ignored by RC.</li>
<li><a href="predefined-macros.html">Predefined macros</a>, which take no arguments and cannot be redefined.</li>
<li><a href="preprocessor-directives.html">Preprocessor directives</a>, which instruct RC to perform actions on the script before compiling it.</li>
<li><a href="preprocessor-operators.html">Preprocessor operators</a>, which are used with the <strong>#define</strong> directive.</li>
<li><a href="pragma-directives.html">Pragma directives</a></li>
<li><a href="resource-definition-statements.html">Resource-definition statements</a>, which name and describe resources.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Adding, Deleting, and Replacing Resources</h1>
<p>Applications must frequently add, delete, or replace resources in executable files. Two methods can be used to accomplish these tasks. The first is to edit the resource-definition file, recompile the resources, and add the recompiled resources to the application's executable file. The second method is to copy the resource data directly into the application's executable file.</p>
<p>For example, to localize an English-language application for use in Norway, it may be necessary to replace the English dialog box with one using Norwegian. A developer creates an appropriate dialog box by using a dialog box editor or by writing a template in the resource-definition file. The developer then recompiles the resources and adds the new resources to the application's executable file.</p>
<p>If an appropriate dialog box exists in binary form, however, the developer can copy the data directly to the executable file being localized by using the following functions. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-beginupdateresourcea"><strong>BeginUpdateResource</strong></a> function creates an update handle to the executable file whose resources are to be changed. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-updateresourcea"><strong>UpdateResource</strong></a> function uses this handle to add, delete, or replace a resource in the executable file. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-endupdateresourcea"><strong>EndUpdateResource</strong></a> function closes the handle.</p>
<p>After an update handle to an executable file is created by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-beginupdateresourcea"><strong>BeginUpdateResource</strong></a>, an application can use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-updateresourcea"><strong>UpdateResource</strong></a> repeatedly to make changes to the resource data. Each call to <strong>UpdateResource</strong> contributes to an internal list of additions, deletions, and replacements but does not actually write the data to the executable file. Immediately before closing the update handle, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-endupdateresourcea"><strong>EndUpdateResource</strong></a> writes the accumulated changes to the executable file.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an application must copy resources from another file. <a href="using-resources.html">Updating Resources</a> shows an example of obtaining the resource data and its size from a file.</p>

<h1>Predefined Macros</h1>
<p>RC does not support the ANSI C predefined macros (<strong>__DATE__</strong>, <strong>__FILE__</strong>, <strong>__LINE__</strong>, <strong>__STDC__</strong>, <strong>__TIME__</strong>, <strong>__TIMESTAMP__</strong>). Therefore, you cannot include these macros in header files that you will include in your resource script.</p>
<p>RC does define RC_INVOKED, which enables you conditionally compile portions of your header files, depending on whether the compiler is your C compiler or the RC compiler. This is important because the RC compiler supports only a subset of the statements a C compiler would support.</p>
<p>To conditionally compile your code with the RC compiler, surround code that RC cannot compile with #ifndef RC_INVOKED and <strong>#endif</strong>.</p>
<p>The following example is taken from the SDK samples. It demonstrates how to create a header file that can be compiled conditionally.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#ifndef RC_INVOKED
#pragma message(&quot;Including CntrOutl.H from &quot; __FILE__)
#endif
</code></pre>

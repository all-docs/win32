<h1>Pragma Directives</h1>
<p>RC does not support the pragma directives supported by the C/C++ compiler. However, RC does support the following pragma directive for changing the code page:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#pragma code_page( [ DEFAULT | CodePageNum ] )
</code></pre>
<p>This pragma is not supported in an included resource file (.rc). Therefore, if you have a parent .rc file and it includes .rc files for multiple languages, use this pragma before including another .rc file rather than using it in the included .rc file itself. This is demonstrated in the following example.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#include &quot;English.rc&quot;
#pragma code_page(932)
#include &quot;Japanese.rc&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>For a list of values for CodePageNum, see <a href="../intl/code-page-identifiers.html">Code Page Identifiers</a>.</p>

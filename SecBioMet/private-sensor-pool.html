<h1>Private Sensor Pool</h1>
<p>A private sensor pool is a collection of biometric units reserved for exclusive use by a client application. Private pools support proprietary authentication methods and enable a client application to access a biometric unit by using vendor-specified control commands. Biometric units in a private sensor pool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are available only to the client application that created the pool.</li>
<li>Send event notices generated by the completion of biometric operations directly to the application without regard to current window focus.</li>
<li>Use GUIDs to identify biometric templates.</li>
<li>Share a single, application selected template database.</li>
</ul>
<p>Private sensor pools must be used if the client application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manages a collection of dedicated biometric units that use an application-specific template database. For an example, consider an employee attendance application where employees signal their arrival at work by swiping their finger on a fingerprint reader. The employees do not have Windows accounts on the computer running the application. Instead, their fingerprints are identified by GUIDs managed by the attendance application.</li>
<li>Collects biometric samples rather than simply maps samples to SIDs.</li>
<li>Places the biometric unit hardware into maintenance mode to update the firmware.</li>
<li>Sends vendor-defined control commands to the biometric unit hardware or software.</li>
<li>Attempts to configure a biometric unit with onboard storage to operate in advanced mode but the unit cannot perform the required hashing operations.</li>
<li>Runs from a Remote Desktop client session.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Applications can create private sensor pools for fingerprint biometrics only. If an application tries to create one for anything else (e.g., Face), the request will fail.</p>

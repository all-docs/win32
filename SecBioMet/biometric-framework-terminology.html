<tr>
<td>Windows Biometric Framework (WBF)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A framework architecture in Windows that provides a consistent management interface and user experience for biometric devices.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows Biometric Service<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A privileged service that manages all biometric devices by using Windows Biometric Driver Interface (WBDI) compliant device drivers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows Biometric Driver Interface<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>An interface standard for drivers that manage fingerprint sensors.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows Biometric Service Provider (WBSP)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A component of the Windows Biometric Service that manages a specific category of biometric technology such as a fingerprint reader. WBSPs are built into the Windows Biometric Service. They are not plug-ins and third party BSPs are not supported. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biometric factor<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A personal characteristic that can be measured and used for identification. Examples include fingerprints and hand geometry.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biometric sub-factor<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A qualifying characteristic that can be used to further define a biometric factor. For example, to completely identify a fingerprint (biometric factor) it's necessary to specify which finger the print came from (biometric sub-factor).<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biometric sample<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The data that results from the measurement of a single characteristic from a single individual, for example the image of one fingerprint.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biometric template<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A statistical average generated by collecting multiple biometric samples of a single characteristic for a single individual. A template typically contains only the features that are necessary to determine whether a new sample matches.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biometric unit<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A software object that represents a biometric device and can be used to capture and process biometric samples and create, save, and match biometric templates.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sensor adapter<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A biometric unit plug-in component that provides a standard interface for configuring the sensor, capturing samples, and controlling the flow of biometric data to the engine adapter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Engine adapter<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A biometric unit plug-in component that processes a sample by normalizing data, extracting features, and matching sample data to existing templates.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Storage adapter<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A biometric unit plug-in component that stores, manages, and retrieves templates.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Biometric information record (BIR)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A data structure that contains raw or processed biometric information.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sensor pool<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A collection of biometric units that share a common management policy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Liveness testing<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A process that verifies that a biometric sample is not being spoofed or replayed from a sample that was previously collected.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>

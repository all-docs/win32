<h1>Codec implementation</h1>
<p>The Windows Media Audio and Video codecs are implemented as COM objects. Typically, a codec is implemented as a pair of COM objects: one for the encoder and one for the decoder. The encoder has a class identifier (CLSID) and the decoder has a different CLSID. For example, the encoder portion of the Windows Media Audio 9 codec has a CLSID represented by the constant <strong>CLSID_CWMAEncMediaObject</strong>, and the decoder portion of that same codec has a CLSID represented by the constant <strong>CLSID_CWMADecMediaObject</strong>.</p>
<p>In some cases, more than one encoder is included in a single COM object. For example, the Windows Media Video 9 encoder and the Windows Media Video 9.1 encoder are both part of the same COM object. Consequently, they both have the same CLSID, which is represented by the constant <strong>CLSID_CWMV9EncMediaObject</strong>. Similarly, some COM objects include more than one decoder.</p>
<p>Each encoder or decoder object exposes the <a href="/previous-versions/ms785953%28v%3dvs.85%29"><strong>IMediaObject</strong></a> interface so that the object can be used as a DirectX Media Object (DMO) and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mftransform/nn-mftransform-imftransform"><strong>IMFTransform</strong></a> interface so that the object can be used as a Media Foundation Transform (MFT).</p>
<p>For most encoders, regardless of whether you use the encoder as a DMO or an MFT, you use the same CLSID to create an instance of the encoder. For example, to create an instance of the Windows Media Video 9 encoder, you use <strong>CLSID_CWMV9EncMediaObject</strong>, regardless of whether you intend to use the encoder as a DMO or an MFT. Similarly, for most decoders, each decoder has a single CLSID regardless of whether you use the decoder as a DMO or an MFT.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
There are some exceptions to the preceding statement about using a single CLSID for both the DMO and the MFT. For example, the MPEG-4 Part 2 decoder has one CLSID when it is acting as a DMO and a different CLSID when it is acting as an MFT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>In addition to the core interfaces, each encoder or decoder object implements two similar interfaces for working with codec properties, <strong>IPropertyBag</strong> and <strong>IPropertyStore</strong>. Older versions of the encoder and decoder objects used <strong>IPropertyBag</strong>, which identifies each property by a string value containing a property name. <strong>IPropertyStore</strong> is a newer interface that identifies properties with a unique property key value. Support for <strong>IPropertyStore</strong> was added to provide support for MFTs. Most <strong>IPropertyBag</strong> property name strings have a corresponding <strong>IPropertyStore</strong> property key GUID and most of the GUIDs have a corresponding <strong>IPropertyBag</strong> name string, with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>This documentation lists the properties by property key constant, but each entry includes the property-name string constant for use with <strong>IPropertyBag</strong> when appropriate.</p>

<h1>How can a video stream encoded using quality-based VBR have fewer frames than the original stream?</h1>
<p>The frame count of an encoded stream can be lower than the frame count of the original for one of two reasons: duplicate frames and dropped frames.</p>
<p>The encoder does not normally produce frames that are exact duplicates of the previous frame. If you need to have a sample for every frame (this is required by some containers, for example), you can configure the encoder to produce &quot;dummy&quot; frames by setting the <a href="mfpkey-producedummyframesproperty.html">MFPKEY_PRODUCEDUMMYFRAMES</a> property to VARIANT_TRUE.</p>
<p>The encoder drops frames when it cannot encode all of the frames without overflowing the buffer. Dropped frames affect the quality of the stream, duplicate frames do not.</p>
<p>You can get frame statistics from the encoder to determine whether frames have been dropped. For more information, see <a href="gettingencodingstatistics.html">Getting Encoding Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, quality-based VBR streams will only have fewer frames than the original if there are duplicate frames (because the bit rate is not constrained).</p>

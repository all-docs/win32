<h1>Overview of Table of Contents Parser</h1>
<p>Table of Contents Parser (TOC Parser) is a Windows component that enables you to store advanced index information in media files. Examples of advanced index information are tables of contents, semantic indices, and story boards.</p>
<p>With TOC Parser, you can write software that enables users to find scenes of interest in a video file. For example, you can provide the user with a table of contents so that he or she can identify the primary sections of the video and then view a particular section. You can also provide the user with an index so that he or she can find a list of scenes that are related to a particular word or phrase.</p>
<p>Table of Contents Generator (TOC Generator) is a Windows component that works along with TOC Parser. TOC Generator can detect scenes and clusters of scenes in a video file and then generate a table of contents that you can use as a starting point in your software.</p>
<p>The following list gives some scenarios in which you could use the services provided by TOC Parser or TOC Generator.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a table of contents from scratch and embed it in a video file.</li>
<li>Read a table of contents that is already embedded in a video file.</li>
<li>Edit a table of contents that is already embedded in a video file.</li>
<li>Use TOC Generator to create a table of contents based on scenes and clusters that it detects in a video file. Edit the generated table of contents and embed it in the video file.</li>
</ul>

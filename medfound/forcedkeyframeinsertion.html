<h1>Forced Key Frame Insertion (Microsoft Media Foundation)</h1>
<p>When you configure a video encoder object, you can set a maximum interval for key frames in the encoded content. However, the codec will place key frames within that interval as dictated by the content; the key frame interval is not constant. For some applications, the key frame distance is very important. For example, a video editing application needs key frames at locations that are logical to an editor, like at scene breaks and shot transitions.</p>
<p>Forced key frame insertion is a feature that enables you to request that an input frame be encoded as a key frame. The encoder will try to honor these requests, but the buffer settings (bit rate and buffer window) configured for the encoding session always take precedence.</p>
<p>The video encoder objects implement forced key frame insertion as a response to a data unit extension attached to the input sample. For more information about data unit extensions, see <a href="usingdataunitextensions.html">Using Data Unit Extensions</a>.</p>
<p>The extension data for forced key frame insertion is identified by the following GUID value: <strong>F72A3C6F-6EB4-4EBC-B192-09AD9759E828</strong>. The individual extensions are <strong>BOOL</strong> values. Set the value to <strong>TRUE</strong> to indicate a key frame request.</p>

<h1>Building Topologies by Using TopoEdit</h1>
<p>A topology must have the following three nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source node: The streams from a media file, which are used as a source for the topology.</li>
<li>Transform node: A Media Foundation transform (MFT). These nodes are usually encoders, decoders, and effects for the topology.</li>
<li>Output node: The stream sink that passes the media data, video frames, or audio streams to the Media Session for playback.</li>
</ul>
<p>For information about topology structure, see <a href="about-topologies.html">About Topologies</a>.</p>
<p>To build a topology, you must add the nodes, connect the nodes, and resolve the topology so that it can be played.</p>
<p>Topology nodes are displayed as boxes, with text showing the name of the node. Green boxes represent the nodes that are added by the user. When a topology is resolved, TopoEdit can add transform nodes to the topology automatically. These appear as blue boxes on the <strong>Topology Pane</strong>.</p>
<p>Topology inputs and outputs are represented by as black squares along the edge of the node. The <em>node input</em> is shown on the left side of the node, and the <em>node output</em> is on the right side of the node.</p>
<p>The topology nodes are connected through a <em>node connection</em> that appears as a black line connecting the node input of one node to the node output of another node.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows a connected topology for an audio source.</p>

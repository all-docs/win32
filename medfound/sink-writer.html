<h1>Sink Writer</h1>
<p>The sink writer is a component for encoding audio or video files.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows, at a high level, how an application uses the sink writer to encode and audio/video file.</p>
<p><img src="images/encoding09.png" alt="a diagram that shows the sink writer." /></p>
<p>The sink writer hosts a media sink and optionally one or more encoders. The encoders convert uncompressed audio or video data to encoded bitstreams. The media sink outputs the bitstreams to a file. The sink writer performs the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loads the media sink.</li>
<li>Finds and loads the encoders.</li>
<li>Manages the data flow to the encoders and the media sink.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application passes audio/video data to the sink writer as input. It does not matter how the application obtains or generates the input data. One option is to use the <a href="source-reader.html">Source Reader</a>, as shown in the following diagram. However, the sink writer does not require the use of the source reader. These two components are independent.</p>

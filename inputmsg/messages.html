<td>Posted when a pointer makes contact over the non-client area of a window. The message targets the window over which the pointer makes contact. The pointer is implicitly captured to the window so that the window continues to receive input for the pointer until it breaks contact. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If a window has captured this pointer, this message is not posted. Instead, a <a href="wm-pointerdown.html"><strong>WM_POINTERDOWN</strong></a> is posted to the window that has captured this pointer. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <strong>Important:</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Desktop apps should be DPI aware. If your app is not DPI aware, screen coordinates contained in pointer messages and related structures might appear inaccurate due to DPI virtualization. DPI virtualization provides automatic scaling support to applications that are not DPI aware and is active by default (users can turn it off).

<h1>About the Grouping API</h1>
<p>The Peer Grouping API combines the technology of the <a href="pnrp-namespace-provider-api.html">PNRP Name Space Provider API</a> and the <a href="graphing-api.html">Graphing API</a>. Grouping adds the following two pieces of technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>A multiplexing layer that allows multiple applications to use one graph, one port, and one record database.</li>
<li>Security that ensures only peers invited to a group can join and connect throughout the lifetime of a group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grouping provides an accessible and easy approach to peer networking because of the straightforward call flow and secure messaging. This API utilizes PNRP for group discovery and a standard PKI-based security provider instead of requiring a developer to implement one. However, if your application demands greater flexibility in terms of security options, consider using the <a href="about-the-graphing-api.html">Graphing API</a>.</p>
<p>The following table identifies the topics in this Grouping API section:</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
Applications using the Grouping API in an environment with a firewall require exception groups that cover the port specific to the application, as well as port '3587-TCP' for the Grouping API and port '3540-UDP' for PNRP. These exception groups should be enabled whenever the application is running.</p>

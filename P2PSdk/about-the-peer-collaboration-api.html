<h1>About the Peer Collaboration API</h1>
<p>The Peer Collaboration Infrastructure provides a peer network-based framework for collaborative serverless activities, such as network game matchmaking, conferencing, and other interactive multi-participant activities.</p>
<p>The Peer Collaboration Infrastructure provides APIs that simplify the process by which applications can track peer presence without a server, send invitations to participants, discover peers on the same subnet or LAN, and manage contacts.</p>
<p>In addition, this infrastructure also allows peers to discover other peers on the same subnet or local area network and allows interaction between those peers.</p>
<p>Serverless presence is a feature of the Peer Collaboration Infrastructure available to all WindowsÂ Vista applications. Any application that uses the serverless presence component of the collaboration infrastructure will be able to correctly display the user's presence to any application watching it. The users are also able to publish detailed information about their presence, and to publish data objects registered with the peer.</p>

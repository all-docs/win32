<h1>People Near Me APIs</h1>
<p>Any applications capable of <a href="about-people-near-me.html">People Near Me</a> (PNM) can use the following Win32 APIs:</p>
<h3>Contacts API</h3>
<p>The Contacts API is used to access the contact information for the logged on user, retrieve information about previously stored contacts, or store the contact information and digital certificate of a new contact.</p>
<h3>People Near Me API</h3>
<p>The PNM API is used to find users nearby, their advertised interests, any arbitrary objects they choose to publish, and advertised applications.</p>
<h3>Publication API</h3>
<p>The Publication API is used to interact with remote contacts. The <a href="windows-peer-components-for-people-near-me.html">Peer Signaling</a> layer used by the Publication Manager is also used by the PNM module for establishing connections.</p>
<h3>Invitation API</h3>
<p>The Invitation API is used by a collaboration application to invite specific peer(s) into a collaboration activity.</p>
<h3>Application Registration API</h3>
<p>The Application Registration API is used by the installer of a collaboration application to register the application. A PNM-capable application will prompt the user during the installation process to determine whether the application should be made available to users on the subnet.</p>

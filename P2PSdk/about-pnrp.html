<h1>About PNRP</h1>
<p>The Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP) Namespace Provider (NSP) is a serverless name resolution technology that allows nodes to discover each other. PNRP uses the Winsock 2 Namespace Provider API.</p>
<p>IPv6 support is required by PNRP and is the only Internet Protocol native to the API. However, PNRP can resolve IPv4 addresses via the 6to4 or <a href="/windows/desktop/Teredo/portal">Teredo</a> transition technologies. WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1) users must use the Advanced Networking Pack to enable the IPv6 support required by PNRP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Applications using PNRP in an environment with a firewall require exception groups that cover the port specific to the application, as well as port '3540-UDP' for PNRP. These exception groups should be enabled whenever the application is running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PNRP 2.0 is native to the WindowsÂ Vista and Windows ServerÂ 2008 platforms.</p>

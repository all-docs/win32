<h1>Peer Events Infrastructure</h1>
<p>The Peer Infrastructure uses events to notify applications of changes that have occurred within a peer network, for example, a node that is added or removed from a graph. The Peer Graphing and Peer Grouping Infrastructures use the peer events infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Receiving Peer Event Notification</h2>
<p>A peer can register to receive notification when an attribute of a graph or group changes, or a specific peer event occurs. A peer application calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphregisterevent"><strong>PeerGraphRegisterEvent</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupregisterevent"><strong>PeerGroupRegisterEvent</strong></a> function, and passes an event handle to the Peer Infrastructure, which is created previously by a call to <a href="graphing-reference-links.html"><strong>CreateEvent</strong></a>. The Peer Infrastructure uses the handle to signal an application that a peer event has occurred.</p>
<p>The application also passes a series of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_graph_event_registration"><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_REGISTRATION</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_group_event_registration"><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_REGISTRATION</strong></a> structures that indicate to the Peer Infrastructure the specific peer events for which the application is requesting notification. The application must also specify exactly how many structures are being passed.</p>
<h2>Peer Graphing Events</h2>
<p>A Peer Graphing application can register to receive notification for 9 peer graph events. Each event name is prefaced with <strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_</strong>, for example, <strong>PEER_GRAPH_STATUS_CHANGED</strong>. Unless otherwise noted, information about a change is retrieved by using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGraphGetEventData</strong></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_STATUS_CHANGED</strong> indicates that the status of a graph is changed, for example, a node has synchronized with a graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGED</strong> indicates that a property of a graph or group is changed, for example, the friendly name of a graph has changed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The application must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphgetproperties"><strong>PeerGraphGetProperties</strong></a> to obtain the changed information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_RECORD_CHANGED</strong> indicates that a record is changed, for example, a record is deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_DIRECT_CONNECTION</strong> indicates that a direct connection is changed, for example, a node has connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_NEIGHBOR_CONNECTION</strong> indicates that a connection to a neighbor node is changed, for example, a node has connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_INCOMING_DATA</strong> indicates that data has been received from a direct or neighbor connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_CONNECTION_REQUIRED</strong> indicates that the Graphing Infrastructure requires a new connection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
A call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphconnect"><strong>PeerGraphConnect</strong></a> connects to a new node. A call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGraphGetEventData</strong></a> does not return data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_NODE_CHANGED</strong> indicates that node presence information is changed, for example, an IP address has changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_SYNCHRONIZED</strong> indicates that a specific record type is synchronized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After an application receives notification that a peer event has occurred, the application calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGraphGetEventData</strong></a>, and passes the peer event handle returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphregisterevent"><strong>PeerGraphRegisterEvent</strong></a>. The Peer Infrastructure returns a pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_graph_event_data"><strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_DATA</strong></a> structure that contains the requested data. This function should be called until <strong>PEER_S_NO_EVENT_DATA</strong> is returned.</p>
<p>After an application does not require a peer event notification, the application calls either <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphunregisterevent"><strong>PeerGraphUnregisterEvent</strong></a>, and passes the peer event handle returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphregisterevent"><strong>PeerGraphRegisterEvent</strong></a> when the application registered.</p>
<h2>Handling Graph Connection Referrals</h2>
<p>When <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergraphconnect"><strong>PeerGraphConnect</strong></a> is called, the connecting peer is notified of success or failure through the asynchronous <strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_NEIGHBOR_CONNECTION</strong> event. If the connection failed due to a specific networking issues (such as a misconfigured firewall), the <strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_NEIGHBOR_CONNECTION</strong> event is raised, with the connection status set to <strong>PEER_CONNECTION_FAILED</strong>.</p>
<p>However, when a peer receives a referral when it attempts to connect to a busy node, the <strong>PEER_GRAPH_EVENT_NEIGHBOR_CONNECTION</strong> is raised on the connecting peer, with the connection status set to <strong>PEER_CONNECTION_FAILED</strong>. The connecting peer may be referred to another node which itself is busy and may send a referral, and the same event and status are raised on the connecting peer. This chain of referrals that result in <strong>PEER_CONNECTION_FAILED</strong> event statuses can continue until the maximum number of connection attempts has been exhausted. The peer does not have a mechanism to determine the difference between a full connection attempt and the connection referral.</p>
<p>To address this issue, developers should consider using the peer graph status change events to determine if the connection attempt suceeded. If the event is not received within a specific amount of time, the application can assume that the connecting peer is being referred and that the peer application should consider the connection attempt a failure.</p>
<h2>Peer Grouping Events</h2>
<p>A Peer Grouping application can register to receive notification for 8 peer events. Each event name is prefaced with <strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_</strong>; for example, <strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_STATUS_CHANGED</strong>. Unless otherwise noted, information about a change is retrieved by using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGroupGetEventData</strong></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_STATUS_CHANGED</strong> indicates that the group status has changed. There are two status values possible: <strong>PEER_GROUP_STATUS_LISTENING</strong>, which indicates that the group has no connections and is waiting for new members; and <strong>PEER_GROUP_STATUS_HAS CONNECTIONS</strong>, which indicates that the group has at least one connection. This status value can be obtained by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgetstatus"><strong>PeerGroupGetStatus</strong></a> after this event is raised.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGED</strong> indicates that the group properties have been changed or updated by the group creator.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_RECORD_CHANGED</strong> indicates that a record operation has been performed. This event is raised when a peer participating in the group publishes, updates, or deletes a record. For example, this event is raised when a chat application sends a chat message.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_MEMBER_CHANGED</strong> indicates that a member's status within the group has changed. Status changes include:
<ul>
<li><strong>PEER_MEMBER_CONNECTED</strong>. A peer has connected to the group.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_MEMBER_DISCONNECTED</strong>. A peer has disconnected from the group.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_MEMBER_JOINED</strong>. New membership information has been published for a peer.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_MEMBER_UPDATED</strong>. A peer has updated with new information, such as a new IP address.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_NEIGHBOR_CONNECTION</strong>. Peers who will participate in neighbor connections within the group must register for this event. Note that registering for this event does not enable the peer to receive data; registration for this event only ensures notification when a request for a neighbor connection is received.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_DIRECT_CONNECTION</strong>. Peers who will participate in direct connections within the group must register for this event. Note that registering for this event does not enable the peer to receive data; registration for this event only ensures notification when a request for a direct connection is received.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_INCOMING_DATA</strong>. Peers who will receive data over a neighbor or direct connection must register for this event. When this event is raised, the opaque data transmitted by the other participating peer can be obtained by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGroupGetEventData</strong></a>. Note that to receive this event, the peer must have previously registered for <strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_DIRECT_CONNECTION</strong> or <strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_NEIGHBOR_CONNECTION</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_CONNECTION_FAILED</strong>. A connection failed for some reason. No data is provided when this event is raised, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGroupGetEventData</strong></a> should not be called.</li>
</ul>
<p>After an application receives notification that a peer event has occurred (excluding <strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_CONNECTION_FAILED</strong>), the application calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGroupGetEventData</strong></a>, and passes the peer event handle returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupregisterevent"><strong>PeerGroupRegisterEvent</strong></a>. The Peer Infrastructure returns a pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/p2p/ns-p2p-peer_group_event_data-r1"><strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_DATA</strong></a> structure that contains the requested data. This function must be called until <strong>PEER_S_NO_EVENT_DATA</strong> is returned. When an application no longer requires notification for a peer event, a call must be made to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupunregisterevent"><strong>PeerGroupUnregisterEvent</strong></a>, passing the peer event handle returned by <strong>PeerGroupRegisterEvent</strong> when the application registered for the particular event.</p>
<h2>Example of Registering for Peer Graphing Events</h2>

            wprintf(L&quot;Could not set up event callback.\n&quot;);
            CloseHandle(g_hEvent);
            g_hEvent = NULL;
        }
    }

    return hr;

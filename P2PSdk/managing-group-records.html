<h1>Managing Group Records</h1>
<p>A group record is specific data published to all active members of a peer group, for example, a chat message or an application-specific status update. A record is represented by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_record"><strong>PEER_RECORD</strong></a> structure, and contains the following information about a peer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The record ID is a value that uniquely identifies a record in the peer group.</li>
<li>A GUID that specifies the record type. Applications can support different record types. An application interprets the <strong>data</strong> field of a record based on the record type. Some GUIDs are reserved, and the API call returns <strong>PEER_E_NOT_AUTHORIZED</strong> when the application attempts to use them.</li>
<li>A set of record attributes described as an XML string. The attributes are used when searching records. For more information about attributes, see <a href="record-attribute-schema.html">Record Attribute Schema</a>.</li>
<li>The peer time that a record is created.</li>
<li>The peer time that a record expires.</li>
<li>The peer time that a record is modified.</li>
<li>The creator of a record.</li>
<li>The member who modifies a record.</li>
<li>A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_data"><strong>PEER_DATA</strong></a> structure that contains the cryptographic signature for all of the fields in this <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_record"><strong>PEER_RECORD</strong></a> structure. This field cannot be directly updated or altered by a peer.</li>
<li>A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_data"><strong>PEER_DATA</strong></a> structure that contains the application-specific data associated with this record as an array of bytes. The type of data present in this field is determined by application-defined record type.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Obtaining Peer Group Records</h2>
<p>Individual records are obtained by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgetrecord"><strong>PeerGroupGetRecord</strong></a> with the ID of the record. When processing all records of a specific type, the enumerated set of all current peer group records is obtained by first calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupenumrecords"><strong>PeerGroupEnumRecords</strong></a> to open the enumeration and then iteratively calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergetnextitem"><strong>PeerGetNextItem</strong></a> until all records are retrieved. When finished, close the enumeration and release the memory associated with it by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peerendenumeration"><strong>PeerEndEnumeration</strong></a>.</p>
<p>When a record is created, deleted, or updated by a peer, the affected record is published to all members of the peer group by way of the <strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_RECORD_CHANGE</strong> event. Note that if a peer is not connected to the group, it will receive the updated record then next time it connects. It is important to register for this event with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupregisterevent"><strong>PeerGroupRegisterEvent</strong></a> if your application maintains or manages records in any meaningful way. Alternatively, the application can query the record database on demand using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupsearchrecords"><strong>PeerGroupSearchRecords</strong></a>.</p>
<p>When the <strong>PEER_GROUP_EVENT_RECORD_CHANGE</strong> event is raised, the specific record ID and type as well as the type of change (add, update, delete) is received as a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_event_record_change_data"><strong>PEER_EVENT_RECORD_CHANGE_DATA</strong></a> structure. This structure is obtained with a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgeteventdata"><strong>PeerGroupGetEventData</strong></a>. If the change is an add or an update, you should use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgetrecord"><strong>PeerGroupGetRecord</strong></a> to obtain the record with the supplied ID. The local record database for the infrastructure is updated automatically.</p>
<p>You can also search for specific records based on specific custom attributes supplied in the <strong>pwzAttributes</strong> field of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_record"><strong>PEER_RECORD</strong></a>, as well as any predefined attributes. To accomplish this, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupsearchrecords"><strong>PeerGroupSearchRecords</strong></a> function with an XML search query formatted as specified in the <a href="record-search-query-format.html">Record Search Query Format</a> topic.</p>
<p>For more details on working with records in the Peer Infrastructure, please refer to the <a href="records.html">Records</a> topic in <a href="using-the-peer-infrastructure.html">Using the Peer Infrastructure</a>.</p>
<h2>Administration of Peer Group Records</h2>
<p>When the initial invitations are issued by the peer group's creator, it can specify that certain members serve in an administrative role (PEER_GROUP_ROLE_ADMIN) whenever it issues new credentials to the user (via either <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupcreateinvitation"><strong>PeerGroupCreateInvitation</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupissuecredentials"><strong>PeerGroupIssueCredentials</strong></a>). An administrator has the ability to directly add, delete, and update any peer group records. Conversely, a peer group member with it's role set to either <strong>PEER_GROUP_ROLE_MEMBER</strong> or <strong>PEER_GROUP_ROLE_INVITING_MEMBER</strong> can only add, update, and delete its own record(s).</p>
<p>The creator has the administrator role by default.</p>
<p>To update a record, obtain the record with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupgetrecord"><strong>PeerGroupGetRecord</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupenumrecords"><strong>PeerGroupEnumRecords</strong></a>, make the changes, and pass the updated record to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupupdaterecord"><strong>PeerGroupUpdateRecord</strong></a>.</p>
<p>To delete a record, pass the record ID to delete to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupdeleterecord"><strong>PeerGroupDeleteRecord</strong></a>.</p>
<p>To add a record, create a new <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_record"><strong>PEER_RECORD</strong></a> structure and populate the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>dwSize</strong>. This field contains the value of <strong>sizeof</strong>(<a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/ns-p2p-peer_record"><strong>PEER_RECORD</strong></a>).</li>
<li><strong>ftExpiration</strong>. This field contains the expiration date and time of this record, expressed in peer time as a <strong>FILETIME</strong> structure.</li>
<li><strong>type</strong>. This field contains a <strong>GUID</strong> value that identifies the record type to the application. If this type is custom to your application infrastructure, you should also populate the <strong>data</strong> field.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following fields are populated by the infrastructure, and will be ignored if set by the application:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong></li>
<li><strong>pwzCreatorId</strong></li>
<li><strong>pwzLastModifiedById</strong></li>
<li><strong>ftCreation</strong></li>
<li><strong>ftLastModified</strong></li>
<li><strong>securityData</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining fields are optional. To add this new record to the peer group, pass it to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupaddrecord"><strong>PeerGroupAddRecord</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Importing and Exporting Records</h2>
<p>Peer-to-peer group records are maintained locally as a database. To save a current snapshot of the peer group record database to a local file, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupexportdatabase"><strong>PeerGroupExportDatabase</strong></a>, and pass it the handle to the peer group. This file can then be transported to a different computer or application, which can extract and use this record database by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/P2P/nf-p2p-peergroupimportdatabase"><strong>PeerGroupImportDatabase</strong></a>.</p>

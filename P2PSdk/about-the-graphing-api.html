<h1>About the Graphing API</h1>
<p>The Peer Graphing API allows applications to pass data between peers efficiently and reliably. The core concepts of peer graph technology are the <strong>nodes</strong> of a peer graph, and event notices.</p>
<h2>Nodes</h2>
<p>A node represents a specific instance of a peer on a network. The Peer Graphing API infrastructure ensures that each node has a consistent view of the data in a graph. A node has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can connect to a different node, and form an interrelated network called a peer graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can share data with other nodes in a graph in the form of a <a href="records.html">record</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can create direct connections separate from the peer graphs established by using the Peer <a href="about-the-grouping-api.html">Grouping API</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Direct connections allow nodes to send private data to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Event Notices</h2>
<p>The Peer Graphing API has an event infrastructure that allows an application to register and receive notice of a peer event within the Peer Graphing API infrastructure. When something changes within a peer graph, an application sends an event notice to identify that a change has occurred.</p>

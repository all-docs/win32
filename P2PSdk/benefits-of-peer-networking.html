<h1>Benefits of Peer Networking</h1>
<p>The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure provides a complete solution for you to create peer-to-peer networking applications. You can use the Peer-to-Peer Graphing, Grouping, Identity Manager, and PNRP Namespace Provider APIs to create new, exciting, and robust peer-to-peer applications. The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure provides a solid networking infrastructure so that you can concentrate on <strong>developing</strong> applications, because the infrastructure is developed for you.</p>
<h2>Design Features</h2>
<p>The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure provides the following features:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Secure</strong></td>
<td>Robustness if there are failures or directed attacks</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Scalable</strong></td>
<td>Scalability from simple LANs to the entire Internet</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Serverless</strong></td>
<td>No central point of failure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Self-tuning</strong></td>
<td>Adapts to changes within the infrastructure</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Self-repairing</strong></td>
<td>Automatically repairs and corrects itself</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sharing</strong></td>
<td>Enables sharing from edge-of-network endpoints</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>By using the Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure, you can create the following types of applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time networking and communication</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Content distribution</li>
<li>Distributed processing coordination</li>
<li>Internet technologies and protocols</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternative to DNS</h2>
<p>Because peer-to-peer entities participate and communicate on an ad hoc basis, the Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure is an effective alternative to DNS for name resolution. The Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure uses the PNRP Namespace Provider API to provide a serverless mechanism for resolving peer-to-peer names.</p>

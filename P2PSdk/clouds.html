<h1>Clouds</h1>
<p>Clouds are used by the Peer <a href="grouping-api.html">Grouping</a> and <a href="graphing-api.html">Graphing</a> Infrastructures. The <a href="pnrp-namespace-provider-api.html">Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP)</a> identifies a cloud as a set of peers that can communicate within the same IPv6 scope. Clouds are closely related to the IPv6 scopes. The following list identifies some of the unique cloud features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cloud is identified by a name, and available clouds can be enumerated by using <a href="pnrp-and-wsalookupservicebegin.html"><strong>WSALookupServiceBegin</strong></a>.</li>
<li>If a computer is connected to the Internet, it is part of a global cloud, which is identified by the string &quot;Global_&quot;.</li>
<li>If a computer is connected to one or more local area networks (LAN), individual clouds are available for each link.</li>
<li>One computer can be connected to many networks by having multiple network adapters or by using a virtual private network (VPN), which means that a computer with one interface can be visible in many clouds.</li>
<li>You can use PNRP to register and resolve peer names in a specific cloud.</li>
</ul>

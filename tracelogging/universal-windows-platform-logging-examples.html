<h1>Universal Windows Platform Logging Example</h1>
<p>This sample shows how to use the Logging APIs in the
Windows.Foundation.Diagnostics namespace, including LoggingChannel,
LoggingActivity, LoggingSession, and FileLoggingSession. These classes are
designed for diagnostic logging within a Windows app. These APIs were added in
Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>The LoggingChannel and LoggingActivity APIs have been extended in Windows 10 to
support writing complex events using TraceLogging event encoding.</p>
<p>The Universal Windows Platform logging example can downloaded from
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Logging">GitHub</a>.</p>

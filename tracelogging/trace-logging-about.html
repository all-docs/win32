<h1>About TraceLogging</h1>
<p>TraceLogging is a system for logging events that can be decoded without a
manifest. On Windows, TraceLogging is used in both user-mode and kernel-mode
components to generate
<a href="../etw/about-event-tracing.html">Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)</a> events.
TraceLogging builds on Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) and provides a simplified
way to instrument code.</p>
<p>Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) was introduced with WindowsÂ 2000 and updated in
WindowsÂ Vista. TraceLogging builds on the WindowsÂ Vista ETW APIs. Providers can
use TraceLogging when running on WindowsÂ Vista or later. Existing ETW trace
controllers can be used to control TraceLogging providers and capture traces
using WindowsÂ Vista APIs. Existing ETW trace decoders that use TDH decoding APIs
can decode TraceLogging events when running on Windows 10 or later.</p>
<p>TraceLogging offers several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity of defining events directly in code, similar to WPP but without the
need for a preprocessing tool.</li>
<li>Structured data: named fields with types, support for arrays and structures.</li>
<li>Event correlation through
<a href="/windows/win32/api/traceloggingprovider/nf-traceloggingprovider-traceloggingopcode">ETW activities</a>.</li>
<li>All the decoding information for the event is included within the event
itself, so no additional files needed to decode.</li>
<li>TraceLogging event provider APIs are available for
<a href="/windows/win32/api/traceloggingprovider/">C/C++</a>,
<a href="/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource">.NET</a>, and
<a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Foundation.Diagnostics.LoggingChannel">Windows Runtime (WinRT)</a>.
External support available for <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/tracelogging/tree/main/etw/python/traceloggingdynamic">Python</a>, Rust, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>While TraceLogging provides several benefits and should be considered for new
tracing, manifest-based ETW is still appropriate for many scenarios.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your events are targeting one of the legacy Windows Logs in Windows Event
Log (e.g. the System or Application logs), continue to use manifest-based ETW.</li>
<li>If trace file size is an important consideration, continue to use
manifest-based ETW. TraceLogging events include the event strings (provider
name, event name, and field names) inside each event and are usually larger
than the equivalent manifest-based event.</li>
<li>If you have a large investment in an existing trace technology, there is no
requirement to switch to TraceLogging.</li>
<li>Otherwise, consider using TraceLogging as it offers a simpler experience for
the developer and the event consumer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>API high-level overview</h2>
<p>There are multiple TraceLogging APIs, each targeting different developer
audiences.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need to generate events from C or C++ code,
<a href="/windows/win32/api/traceloggingprovider/"><strong>TraceLoggingProvider.h</strong></a>
provides an efficient API for generating TraceLogging events from user-mode or
kernel-mode code. The events must be defined at compile-time.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if you need to generate events from .NET code, the .NET
<a href="/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource"><strong>EventSource</strong></a> class
supports generating both manifest-based and TraceLogging-based ETW events. The
events must be defined at compile-time.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if you are using the Windows Runtime (WinRT),
<a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Foundation.Diagnostics.LoggingChannel"><strong>LoggingChannel</strong></a>
has been extended in WindowsÂ 10 to log TraceLogging events.</li>
<li>Otherwise, you might be able to use a community-supported option such as
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/tracelogging/tree/main/etw"><strong>TraceLoggingDynamic</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>

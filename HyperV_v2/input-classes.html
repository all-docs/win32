<h1>Input classes</h1>
<p>The user input devices are represented by these classes. A virtual machine always has one instance of each class associated with it. These devices may not be added or removed from the virtual machine. Therefore, there are no resource pool instances for keyboard or mouse devices.</p>
<p>The keyboard and mouse devices are linked to the virtual machine through the <a href="msvm-systemdevice.html"><strong>Msvm_SystemDevice</strong></a> association. A virtual machine contains both a PS2 and a synthetic mouse device. Only one pointing device is active at a time.</p>
<p>The following are virtualization WMI classes related to input.</p>

<h1>Diagnostics</h1>
<p>Windows has APIs and services that support diagnostics in and of your desktop apps. They provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debugging and error handling.</li>
<li>Support for profiling the performance of your apps.</li>
<li>Support for troubleshooting and error reporting.</li>
<li>System monitoring and event notification.</li>
<li>Network monitoring and diagnostics.</li>
<li>Assessment of system state.</li>
</ul>

<td><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/axe/axe-access-portal">Assessment Execution Engine</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The Windows Assessment Execution Engine (AXE) enables the management and execution of Windows system assessments. Assessments can help a person understand the state of a system and remedy problems with performance, reliability, or functionality. AXE provides infrastructure needed to manage assessments using a UX tool or script, run assessments, make measurements, process raw data into results, run diagnostics, and publish the results.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<td>Describes debugging and error handling.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/hcp/hardware-counter-profiling-portal">Hardware Counter Profiling</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Applications use the Hardware Counter Profiling (HCP) SDK to capture thread profiling data such as cycle time and the reasons for context switches. You can also use HCP to capture counter data for hardware performance counters that you have configured on the system.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./ndf/portal.html">Network Diagnostics Framework</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The Network Diagnostics Framework (NDF) provides a way for component and application developers to simplify network troubleshooting for users. Users can attempt to diagnose and repair a network problem using a single troubleshooting tool. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./netmon2/network-monitor.html">Network Monitor</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Network Monitor captures network traffic for display and analysis. It enables you to perform tasks such as analyzing previously captured data in user-defined methods and extract data from defined protocol parsers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./perfctrs/performance-counters-portal.html">Performance Counters</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Counters are used to provide information as to how well the operating system or an application, service, or driver is performing. The counter data can help determine system bottlenecks and fine-tune system and application performance. The operating system, network, and devices provide counter data that an application can consume to provide users with a graphical view of how well the system is performing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/pla/pla-portal">Performance Logs and Alerts</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Performance Logs and Alerts (PLA) provides application programmers the ability to generate alert notifications based on performance counter thresholds. Programmers can also use PLA to query performance data, create event tracing sessions, capture a computer's configuration, and trace the API calls in some of the Win32 system DLLs.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/proc_snap/process-snapshotting-portal">Process Snapshotting</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Process snapshotting enables you to capture process state, in part or whole. It is similar to the <a href="./toolhelp/tool-help-library.html">Tool Help</a> API, but with one important advantage: it can efficiently capture the virtual address contents of a process using the Windows internal POSIX fork clone capability. The process snapshot can be dumped into a file using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/minidumpapiset/nf-minidumpapiset-minidumpwritedump"><strong>MiniDumpWriteDump</strong></a> function.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./psapi/process-status-helper.html">Process Status API</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The process status application programming interface (PSAPI) is a helper library that makes it easier for you to obtain information about processes and device drivers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./sens/system-event-notification-service-portal.html">System Event Notification Service</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Applications designed for use by mobile users require a unique set of connectivity functions and notifications. In the past these individual applications were required to implement these features internally. The System Event Notification Service (SENS) now provides these capabilities in the operating system, creating a uniform connectivity and notification interface for applications. Using SENS developers can determine connection bandwidth and latency information from within their application and optimize the application's operation based on those conditions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./sysmon/system-monitor-portal.html">System Monitor</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>System Monitor (SYSMON) is the application programming interface (API) that you use to configure the Microsoft System Monitor ActiveX control. The System Monitor control lets you view real-time and previously logged performance counter data such as memory, disk, and processor counter data.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./toolhelp/tool-help-library.html">Tool Help Library</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The functions provided by the tool help library make it easier for you to obtain information about currently executing applications.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./wer/windows-error-reporting.html">Windows Error Reporting</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The error reporting feature enables users to notify Microsoft of application faults, kernel faults, unresponsive applications, and other application specific problems. Microsoft can use the error reporting feature to provide customers with troubleshooting information, solutions, or updates for their specific problems. Developers can use this infrastructure to receive information that can be used to improve their applications.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

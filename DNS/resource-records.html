<h1>Resource Records</h1>
<p>A resource record, commonly referred to as an RR, is the unit of information entry in DNS zone files; RRs are the basic building blocks of host-name and IP information and are used to resolve all DNS queries. Resource records exist as many types to provide extended name-resolution services.</p>
<p>Different types of RRs have different formats, as they contain different data. In general, however, many RRs share a common format, as the following address resource records example illustrates. The following fictional example explains the fields found in an A resource record:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>microsoft.com. 600 IN A 150.150.150.1
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The first field (microsoft.com) denotes the owner.</li>
<li>The second field (600) is the time-to-live (TTL) parameter, in seconds.</li>
<li>The third field (IN) is the class field that represents the protocol family, which is almost always IN, for Internet class.</li>
<li>The fourth field (A) is the type of resource the RR is representing.</li>
<li>The fifth field (150.150.150.1) is the resource data, or RDATA. This field is a variable type that provides information appropriate for the type of resource; in this case, it's a 32-bit IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following resource record types are commonly used in DNS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start of authority (SOA)</li>
<li>Name server (NS)</li>
<li><a href="p-gly.html"><em>Pointer record</em></a> (PTR)</li>
<li>Address (A)</li>
<li>IPv6 Address (AAAA)</li>
<li>Mail exchange (MX)</li>
<li><a href="c-gly.html"><em>Canonical name</em></a> (CNAME)</li>
<li>Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS)</li>
<li>WINS Reverse Look up (WINSR)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other resource record types in DNS. For more information, see <a href="dns-wmi-provider-reference.html">DNS WMI Provider Reference</a>.</p>

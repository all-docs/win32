<h1>DNS WMI Provider Overview</h1>
<p>A provider is an architectural element of <em>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)</em>. WMI defines a unified architecture for describing, accessing, and instrumenting objects. Part of this architecture is a large database of WMI classes used to carry out remote management tasks on specific objects.</p>
<p>WMI providers act as intermediaries between WMI and one or more managed objects. When WMI receives a request from a management application for data that is not available from the CIM repository or for notifications of events that WMI does not support, it forwards the request to a provider. Providers supply data and event notifications for managed objects that are specific to their particular domain. A provider extends the WMI schema of classes to allow WMI to work with new types of objects. The DNS WMI Provider defines classes for querying and configuring a DNS Server, along with its associated DNS zones and DNS records.</p>
<p>The DNS WMI provider exposes a number of DNS objects to clients, including DNS Server, DNS domain, and DNS RR objects. Through those objects, clients are able to perform DNS management activities.</p>
<p>Using the DNS WMI Provider, you can create your own tools to perform most DNS Server administration tasks. For example, you can create, delete, and view zones and records; reset server and zone properties; and perform routine administration operations such as updating the zone, reloading the zone, refreshing the zone, writing the zone back to a file or Active Directory, pausing and resuming the zone, clearing the cache, stopping and starting the DNS service, and viewing statistics.</p>
<p>The DNS WMI Provider has a set of unique behaviors not found in other providers. See the <a href="dns-wmi-provider-reference.html">DNS WMI Provider Reference</a> for class details.</p>

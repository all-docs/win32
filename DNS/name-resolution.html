<h1>Name Resolution</h1>
<p>The purpose of DNS is to provide name resolution: the process of comparing a host name (such as a computer name) to a list of RRs and identifying the corresponding IP address. Reverse name resolution is the process of comparing an IP address to a list of RRs and identifying the corresponding host name. These resolution processes are initiated when a DNS Server receives a query.</p>

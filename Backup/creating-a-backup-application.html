<h1>Creating a Backup Application</h1>
<p>To perform input or output on a tape, a backup application must first obtain a handle of the tape device. The following code sample shows you how to use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a> function to open a tape device.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HANDLE hTape;   // handle to tape device
 
hTape = CreateFile(TEXT(&quot;\\\\.\\TAPE0&quot;),         // tape dev to open
                   GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, // read/write access
                   0,                            // not used
                   0,                            // not used
                   OPEN_EXISTING,                // req for tape devs
                   0,                            // not used
                   NULL);                        // not used
</code></pre>
<p>To back up a directory tree to a tape, an application must use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea"><strong>FindFirstFile</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findnextfilea"><strong>FindNextFile</strong></a> functions to traverse the directory tree. Each time a file is found, the application should get the file attributes by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfileattributesa"><strong>GetFileAttributes</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>If there are hard links, an application should determine the number of links, and save the unique identifier of the file in a table for future comparisons. The first time a file is found, the application should use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a> to open the file, and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-backupread"><strong>BackupRead</strong></a> function to begin the backup. Then it can use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile"><strong>WriteFile</strong></a> function repeatedly to transfer all the information in the buffer used by <strong>BackupRead</strong> to the tape. The second time a file is found (checked against the table of file identifiers when there are hard links), the application can write the general file information to the tape, followed by a stream that has an identifier that is <strong>BACKUP_LINK</strong>.</p>
<p>When restoring files from tape to disk, an application must use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-backupwrite"><strong>BackupWrite</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile"><strong>ReadFile</strong></a> functions. For each file on a tape, the application should use <strong>CreateFile</strong> to create a new file on disk, and <strong>BackupWrite</strong> to begin restoring the file. Then the application should use <strong>ReadFile</strong> repeatedly until all the information for the file is read from the tape into the buffer filled by <strong>BackupWrite</strong>.</p>
<p>If one of the streams in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-backupwrite"><strong>BackupWrite</strong></a> buffer has a <strong>BACKUP_LINK</strong> stream identifier, the application must establish a hard link. If the data needed to establish the link does not exist, <strong>BackupWrite</strong> fails. The application can use a pre-existing catalog to locate and restore the original data, or it can notify the user that the file data to be restored is in a different location.</p>

<h1>SIS Links and Reparse Points</h1>
<p>SIS is an NTFS filter driver that replaces duplicate files with copy-on-write links (referred to as SIS links) that point to a single backing file, reducing the disk and cache overhead of those files. This backing file is contained in a <a href="the-sis-common-store-and-common-store-files.html">common store</a>. The implementation of the SIS architecture makes use of <a href="/windows/desktop/FileIO/reparse-points">reparse points</a> that contain information about the SIS links.</p>
<p>SIS links are implemented as sparse files, usually with most ranges of the file unallocated, and a reparse point. The structure and contents of a reparse point is opaque to your backup and restore applications; however, your applications send and retrieve the data within these reparse points to and from SIS API functions that process the information in them. The information in a reparse point refers to a single backing file that contains the actual file data. This backing file is called a <a href="the-sis-common-store-and-common-store-files.html">common-store file</a>, and it exists in the common store.</p>
<p>When restoring a SIS link, your restore application should perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the common-store file or files to which the SIS link points.</li>
<li>If the file or files do not exist in the common store, restore the file or files along with the SIS link.</li>
<li>If the SIS link points to a common-store file or files that exist on the disk, then restore only the SIS link. Recall that the data in common-store files never changes, so if a given common-store file is still on the disk at restore time, it has the same contents as when it was backed up and there is no need to overwrite it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only additional overhead required for SIS-assisted backups is that your backup application must back up the SIS link and the data associated with the backing files. All SIS backup and restore operations are local to a specific volume.</p>

<h1>The SIS Common Store and Common-Store Files</h1>
<p>All backing files maintained by single-instance store (SIS) backup are called <em>common-store files</em>. One <em>common store</em> exists on each SIS-maintained volume and contains all of the common-store files that exist on that volume. This directory is located in the root directory of the volume and is named &quot;\SIS Common Store&quot;. The common store is implemented as a directory that is protected against normal user access, because common-store files are intended to be accessed directly only by SIS backup API functions and not backup and restore applications.</p>
<p>The properties of a common-store file are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A common-store file may have one or more links pointing to it.</li>
<li>After it is created, the contents of a common-store file never change.</li>
<li>The names of common-store files are globally uniqueâ€”that is, they are unique across all volumes across all systems in the world, and the binding between a common-store file name and its data is globally static.</li>
</ul>
<p>When SIS is enabled on a volume, one copy of the duplicate files is then created to the common store, and all of the duplicate files are replaced with <a href="sis-links-and-reparse-points.html">SIS links</a> pointing to the common-store file. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-storage-solutions/dd573313(v=ws.10)">Enabling or Disabling SIS on a Volume</a> in the TechNet documentation.</p>
<p>When one of the SIS links is accessed for a write operation, the SIS filter first restores the original contents of the SIS link file from the common-store file, the reparse point linking the SIS link file to the common store is removed, and then the write operation is performed on the original destination file.</p>
<p>The common-store file is removed only when the last SIS link pointing to it is deleted.</p>

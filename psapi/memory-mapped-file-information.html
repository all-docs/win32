<h1>Memory-Mapped File Information</h1>
<p>A <em>memory-mapped file</em> (or <em>file mapping</em>) is the result of associating a file's contents with a portion of the virtual address space of a process. It can be used to share a file or memory between two or more processes.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Psapi/nf-psapi-getmappedfilenamea"><strong>GetMappedFileName</strong></a> function receives a process handle and a pointer to an address as input. If the address is within a memory-mapped file in the virtual address space of the process, the function returns the name of the memory-mapped file. The file names returned by <strong>GetMappedFileName</strong> use device form, rather than drive letters. For example, the file name c:\winnt\system32\ctype.nls would look like this in device form:</p>
<p>\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1\WINNT\System32\ctype.nls</p>
<p>For more information about memory-mapped files, see <a href="/windows/desktop/Memory/file-mapping">File Mapping</a>. For an example that converts file names in device form to drive letters, see <a href="/windows/desktop/Memory/obtaining-a-file-name-from-a-file-handle">Obtaining a File Name From a File Handle</a>.</p>

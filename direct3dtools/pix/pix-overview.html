<h2>title: Get started with PIX
description: An overview of how developers can use PIX to improve their Direct3D 12 applications.
ms.topic: article
ms.date: 07/09/2024</h2>
<h1>Get started with PIX</h1>
<p>PIX is a debugging and profiling tool designed for game developers using Direct3D 12. You can <a href="pix-gpu-captures.html">debug rendering issues and analyze frame performance with GPU Captures</a>, or you can take a more <a href="pix-timing-captures.html">traditional profiling approach with Timing Captures</a>.</p>
<p>PIX's CPU profiling capabilities work for any Windows application, and the GPU capabilities work on any application using Direct3D 12 (or Direct3D 11 via <a href="../../direct3d12/direct3d-11-on-12.html">Direct3D 11 on 12</a>). That includes AI and ML workloads using <a href="/windows/ai/directml/dml">DirectML</a>, and games made with popular engines such as Unreal, Unity, and Godot.</p>
<p>While PIX can help you with no prior setup, you might want to check out <a href="pix-instrumenting.html">Instrument your app</a> and <a href="pix-configuring.html">Configure PIX</a> to ensure that you have the best experience with things such as PixEvents and debug symbols.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
PIX is not intended to assist with Direct3D 12 API level issues, such as errors with compiling pipeline state objects. Instead, use <a href="../../direct3d12/using-d3d12-debug-layer-gpu-based-validation.html">GPU-based validation and the Direct3D 12 debug layer</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>There are two ways to install PIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install from Microsoft at the blog post <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/download/">Download</a>.</li>
<li>Install via <a href="/windows/package-manager/winget/">winget</a>. Use the command <code>winget install microsoft.pix</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For notifications on new releases, you can subscribe to the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix/feed/">RSS feed for the PIX on Windows blog</a>.</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>Depending on your goals, you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="pix-gpu-captures.html">Debug rendering issues and analyze frame performance with GPU Captures</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="pix-timing-captures.html">Profile CPU and GPU activity with timing captures</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently-asked questions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>How can I get help?</strong> For bug reports, questions, or any other feedback, you can either send us feedback through the application (using the <strong>Send Feedback</strong> button in the top-right; the icon is a broken heart), or by chatting with us in the pix channel of the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/directx">DirectX Discord server</a>.</li>
<li><strong>What about the old documentation hosted on <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pix</a>?</strong> We've learned over time that the devblog is not a good fit for product documentation. Moving the documentation to Microsoft Learn gives us the ability to provide a better documentation experience.</li>

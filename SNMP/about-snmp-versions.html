<h1>About SNMP Versions</h1>
<p>The original Internet standard Network Management Framework, described in RFCs 1155, 1157, and 1213, is called the SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) framework. Relevant portions of the proposed framework for version 2C of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv2C) are described in RFCs 1901 through 1908.</p>
<p>The WinSNMP API supports the SNMP protocol functionality described in the relevant Internet RFCs. WinSNMP places no constraints on the use of SNMPv1 or SNMPv2C by WinSNMP applications.</p>
<p>A management entity can support a different version of SNMP than the one the WinSNMP application supports. The Microsoft WinSNMP implementation performs the appropriate translations from SNMPv1 to SNMPv2C in accordance with the relevant RFC.</p>

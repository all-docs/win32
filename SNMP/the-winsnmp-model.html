<h1>The WinSNMP Model</h1>
<p>The WinSNMP-compliant model includes the following basic components:</p>
<ul>
<li>A WinSNMP-enabled SNMP network management application, that is, a WinSNMP-compliant <em>application</em></li>
<li>The WinSNMP function layer</li>
<li>A WinSNMP-enabled SNMP service provider, that is, a WinSNMP-compliant <em>implementation</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Network management applications that must convey SNMP messages operate efficiently in an event-driven environment. This is because SNMP is a datagram-based or connectionless protocol between remote entities that do not establish virtual circuits.</p>
<p>Since Microsoft Windows applications are also event-driven, WinSNMP uses a programming model in which the receipt and processing of asynchronous <em>message-events</em> drive management applications. An asynchronous message-event can be an SNMP operation request by a manager application, or the response to a request by an agent application.</p>
<p>SNMP sends requests and responses as SNMP messages. An SNMP message is an SNMP protocol data unit (PDU) plus additional message header elements defined by the relevant RFC.

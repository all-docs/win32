<h1>Supported Versions</h1>
<p>[SNMP is available for use in the operating systems specified in the Requirements section. It may be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions. Instead, use <a href="/windows/desktop/WinRM/portal">Windows Remote Management</a>, which is the Microsoft implementation of WS-Man.]</p>
<p>WindowsÂ Vista and Windows ServerÂ 2008 support SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c. This topic provides basic information about each of these versions of SNMP.</p>
<p>Simple Network Management Protocol version 1 (SNMPv1) is the earliest version of the protocol. SNMPv1 is defined by RFC 1157, RFC 1155, and RFC 1212. For SNMPv1, security is based on community strings.</p>
<p>Simple Network Management Protocol version 2c (SNMPv2c) is defined by RFC 1901, RFC 1905, and RFC 1906. SNMPv2c updates the protocol operations and data types that were defined in SNMPv2p. SNMPv2c, known as &quot;community string-based SNMPv2,&quot; uses SNMPv1 community-based security.</p>
<p>SNMPv2x is supported on WindowsÂ 2000 and later client and server operating system platforms, including WindowsÂ XP and Windows ServerÂ 2003.</p>

<h1>MIB Name Tree</h1>
<p>The name space for MIB object identifiers is hierarchical. It is structured so that each manageable object can be assigned a globally unique name.</p>
<p>Authority for parts of the name space is assigned to individual organizations. This allows organizations to assign names without consulting an Internet authority for each assignment. For example, the name space assigned to Microsoft is 1.3.6.1.4.1.311, which is defined in MSFT.MIB. Microsoft has the authority to assign names to objects anywhere below that name space.</p>
<p>The object identifier in the hierarchy is written as a sequence of subidentifiers beginning at the root and ending at the object. Subidentifiers are separated with a period.</p>

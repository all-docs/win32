<h1>Community Names</h1>
<p>A community name identifies a collection of SNMP managers and agents. The use of a community name provides primitive security and context checking for both agents and managers that receive requests and initiate trap operations. An agent won't accept a request from a manager outside the community.</p>
<p>Note that standard security recommendations recommend against using SNMP except on trusted networks, because the protocol, by design, provides minimal security. For more information, see <a href="configuring-snmp-security.html">Configuring SNMP Security</a>.</p>

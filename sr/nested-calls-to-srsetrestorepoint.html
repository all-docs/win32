<h1>Nested Calls to SRSetRestorePoint</h1>
<p>This topic describes support for nested calls to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/SRRestorePtAPI/nf-srrestoreptapi-srsetrestorepointa"><strong>SRSetRestorePoint</strong></a> through the BEGIN_NESTED_SYSTEM_CHANGE and END_NESTED_SYSTEM_CHANGE event types.</p>
<p>Applications can safely call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/SRRestorePtAPI/nf-srrestoreptapi-srsetrestorepointa"><strong>SRSetRestorePoint</strong></a> when using these event types. The first call to the function creates a restore point. Subsequent nested calls to the function do not create restore points. For example, suppose an application makes the following calls to <strong>SRSetRestorePoint</strong>:<!-- raw HTML omitted --> For restore point A with dwEventType = BEGIN_NESTED_SYSTEM_CHANGE<br />
For restore point B with dwEventType = BEGIN_NESTED_SYSTEM_CHANGE<br />
For restore point B with dwEventType = END_NESTED_SYSTEM_CHANGE<br />
For restore point A with dwEventType = END_NESTED_SYSTEM_CHANGE</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The second call does not create a new restore point because the call is nested.</p>

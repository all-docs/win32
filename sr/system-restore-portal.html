<h1>System Restore</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>System Restore automatically monitors and records key system changes on a user's computer. It is designed to reduce support costs and increase customer satisfaction by enabling a user to undo a change that may have caused a problem with the system, or revert to a day when the system was performing optimally.</p>

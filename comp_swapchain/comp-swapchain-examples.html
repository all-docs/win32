<h1>Composition swapchain code examples</h1>
<p>These code examples use the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/wil">Windows Implementation Libraries (WIL)</a>. A convenient way to install WIL is to go to Visual Studio, click <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage NuGet Packages...</strong> &gt; <strong>Browse</strong>, type or paste <strong>Microsoft.Windows.ImplementationLibrary</strong> in the search box, select the item in search results, and then click <strong>Install</strong> to install the package for that project.</p>
<h2>Example 1—Creating a presentation manager on systems that support the composition swapchain API</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the composition swapchain API requires supported drivers to function. The following example illustrates how your application can create a presentation manager if the system supports the API. This is demonstrated as a <code>TryCreate</code>-style function that returns the presentation manager only if the API is supported. This function also demonstrates how to properly create a Direct3D device to back a presentation manager.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>bool TryCreatePresentationManager(
    _In_ bool requestDirectPresentation,
    _Out_ ID3D11Device** ppD3DDevice,
    _Outptr_opt_result_maybenull_ IPresentationManager **ppPresentationManager)
{
    // Null the presentation manager and Direct3D device initially
    *ppD3DDevice = nullptr;
    *ppPresentationManager = nullptr;

    // Direct3D device creation flags. The composition swapchain API requires that applications disable internal
    // driver threading optimizations, as these optimizations are incompatible with the
    // composition swapchain API. If this flag is not present, then the API will fail the call to create the
    // presentation factory.
    UINT deviceCreationFlags =
        D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_BGRA_SUPPORT |
        D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_SINGLETHREADED |
        D3D11_CREATE_DEVICE_PREVENT_INTERNAL_THREADING_OPTIMIZATIONS;

    // Create the Direct3D device.
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;ID3D11DeviceContext&gt; d3dDeviceContext;
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(D3D11CreateDevice(
        nullptr,                   // No adapter

        nullptr, 0,                // Highest available feature level

        ppD3DDevice,               // Resulting interface pointer
        nullptr,                   // Actual feature level
        &amp;d3dDeviceContext));       // Device context

    // Call the composition swapchain API export to create the presentation factory.
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;IPresentationFactory&gt; presentationFactory;
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(CreatePresentationFactory(
        (*ppD3DDevice),
        IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;presentationFactory)));

    // Determine whether the system is capable of supporting the composition swapchain API based
    // on the capability that's reported by the presentation factory. If your application
    // wants direct presentation (that is, presentation without the need for DWM to
    // compose, using MPO or iflip), then we query for direct presentation support.
    bool isSupportedOnSystem;
    if (requestDirectPresentation)
    {
        isSupportedOnSystem = presentationFactory-&gt;IsPresentationSupportedWithIndependentFlip();
    }
    else
    {
        isSupportedOnSystem = presentationFactory-&gt;IsPresentationSupported();
    }

    // Create the presentation manager if it is supported on the current system.
    if (isSupportedOnSystem)
    {
        FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(presentationFactory-&gt;CreatePresentationManager(ppPresentationManager));
    }

    return isSupportedOnSystem;
}

<h2>Example 2—Creating a presentation manager and presentation surface</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would create a presentation manager and a presentation surface to bind to a visual in a visual tree. Subsequent examples will show how to bind the presentation surface into both <a href="/windows/win32/directcomp/directcomposition-portal"><strong>DirectComposition</strong></a> and <a href="/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition"><strong>Windows.UI.Composition</strong></a> visual trees.</p>
<h3>C++ example (DCompositionGetTargetStatistics)</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>bool MakePresentationManagerAndPresentationSurface(
    _Out_ ID3D11Device** ppD3dDevice,
    _Out_ IPresentationManager** ppPresentationManager,
    _Out_ IPresentationSurface** ppPresentationSurface,
    _Out_ unique_handle&amp; compositionSurfaceHandle)
{
    // Null the output pointers initially.
    *ppD3dDevice = nullptr;
    *ppPresentationManager = nullptr;
    *ppPresentationSurface = nullptr;
    compositionSurfaceHandle.reset();

    com_ptr_failfast&lt;IPresentationManager&gt; presentationManager;
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;IPresentationSurface&gt; presentationSurface;
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;ID3D11Device&gt; d3d11Device;

    // Call the function we defined previously to create a Direct3D device and presentation manager, if
    // the system supports it.
    if (TryCreatePresentationManager(
        true, // Request presentation with independent flip.
        &amp;d3d11Device,
        &amp;presentationManager) == false)
    {
        // Return 'false' out of the call if the composition swapchain API is unsupported. Assume the caller
        // will handle this somehow, such as by falling back to DXGI.
        return false;
    }

    // Use DirectComposition to create a composition surface handle.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(DCompositionCreateSurfaceHandle(
        COMPOSITIONOBJECT_ALL_ACCESS,
        nullptr,
        compositionSurfaceHandle.addressof()));

    // Create presentation surface bound to the composition surface handle.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(presentationManager-&gt;CreatePresentationSurface(
        compositionSurfaceHandle.get(),
        presentationSurface.addressof()));

    // Return the Direct3D device, presentation manager, and presentation surface to the caller for future
    // use.
    *ppD3dDevice = d3d11Device.detach();
    *ppPresentationManager = presentationManager.detach();
    *ppPresentationSurface = presentationSurface.detach();

    // Return 'true' out of the call if the composition swapchain API is supported and we were able to
    // create a presentation manager.
    return true;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 3—Binding a presentation surface to a Windows.UI.Composition surface brush</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would bind a composition surface handle bound to a presentation surface, as created in the above example, to a <a href="/uwp/api/windows.ui.composition"><strong>Windows.UI.Composition</strong></a> (<em>WinComp</em>) surface brush, which can then be bound to a sprite visual in your application's visual tree.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void BindPresentationSurfaceHandleToWinCompTree(
    _In_ ICompositor * pCompositor,
    _In_ ISpriteVisual * pVisualToBindTo, // The sprite visual we want to bind to.
    _In_ unique_handle&amp; compositionSurfaceHandle)
{
    // QI an interop compositor from the passed compositor.
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;ICompositorInterop&gt; compositorInterop;
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pCompositor-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;compositorInterop)));

    // Create a composition surface for the presentation surface's composition surface handle.
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;ICompositionSurface&gt; compositionSurface;
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(compositorInterop-&gt;CreateCompositionSurfaceForHandle(
        compositionSurfaceHandle.get(),
        &amp;compositionSurface));

    // Create a composition surface brush, and bind the surface to it.
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;ICompositionSurfaceBrush&gt; surfaceBrush;
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pCompositor-&gt;CreateSurfaceBrush(&amp;surfaceBrush));
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(surfaceBrush-&gt;put_Surface(compositionSurface.get()));

    // Bind the brush to the visual.
    auto brush = surfaceBrush.query&lt;ICompositionBrush&gt;();
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pVisualToBindTo-&gt;put_Brush(brush.get()));
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 4—Binding a presentation surface to a DirectComposition visual</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would bind a presentation surface to a DirectComposition (<em>DComp</em>) visual in a visual tree.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void BindPresentationSurfaceHandleToDCompTree(
    _In_ IDCompositionDevice* pDCompDevice,
    _In_ IDCompositionVisual* pVisualToBindTo,
    _In_ unique_handle&amp; compositionSurfaceHandle) // The composition surface handle that was
                                                  // passed to CreatePresentationSurface.
{
    // Create a DComp surface to wrap the presentation surface.
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;IUnknown&gt; dcompSurface;
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pDCompDevice-&gt;CreateSurfaceFromHandle(
        compositionSurfaceHandle.get(),
        &amp;dcompSurface));

    // Bind the presentation surface to the visual.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pVisualToBindTo-&gt;SetContent(dcompSurface.get()));
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 5—Setting alpha mode and color space on a presentation surface</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would set alpha mode and color space on a presentation surface. The alpha mode describes whether or not, and how, the alpha channel in the texture should be interpreted. The color space describes the color space to which the texture pixels refer.</p>
<p>All property updates like these will take effect as part of the application's next present, and take effect atomically alongside any buffer updates that are part of that present. A present may also, if your application wishes, not update any buffers at all, and instead, consist only of property updates. Any presentation surfaces whose buffers are not updated on a particular present remain bound to whatever buffer they were bound to before that present.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void SetAlphaModeAndColorSpace(
    _In_ IPresentationSurface* pPresentationSurface)
{
    // Set alpha mode.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationSurface-&gt;SetAlphaMode(DXGI_ALPHA_MODE_IGNORE));

    // Set color space to full RGB.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationSurface-&gt;SetColorSpace(DXGI_COLOR_SPACE_RGB_FULL_G22_NONE_P709));
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 6—Setting letterboxing margins on a presentation surface</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would specify letterboxing margins on a presentation surface. Letterboxing is used to fill a specified area outside of the surface content itself, to account for differing aspect ratios between content and the display device it's being shown on. A good example of this are the black <em>bars</em> that are often visible above and below content when watching on a PC a movie formatted for widescreen theaters. The composition swapchain API allows you to specify the margins within which to render letterboxing in such cases.</p>
<p>Currently, letterboxing areas are always filled with opaque black.</p>
<p>As visual tree content, the presentation surface exists in the coordinate space of its host visual. With letterboxing present, the origin of the visual's coordinate space corresponds to the top-left of the letterboxing. That is to say, the buffer itself exists offset into the visual's coordinate space. The bounds are computed as the size of the buffer plus the size of the letterboxing.</p>
<p>The following illustrates where the buffer and letterboxing exist in visual coordinate space, and how bounds are computed.</p>
<p><img src="images/letterboxing-margins.png" alt="Letterboxing margins" /></p>
<p>Finally, if the transform applied to a presentation surface comes with an offset, then the area not covered by the buffer or the letterboxing is considered outside of the bounds of the content, and is treated as transparent—similar to how any other visual tree content is treated outside of content bounds.</p>
<h3>Letterboxing and transform interaction</h3>
<p>In order to provide consistent letterboxing margin sizes regardless of the scale your application applies to a buffer in order to fill some content area, DWM will attempt to render the margins at a consistent size regardless of scale, but taking into account the result of the transform that has been applied to the presentation surface.</p>
<p>Put another way, letterboxing margins are technically applied before the transform of the presentation surface is applied, but compensate for any scale that might be part of that transform. That is to say, the presentation surface's transform is deconstructed into two components—the part of the transform that scales, and the remainder of the transform.</p>
<p><img src="images/letterboxing-and-transform-interaction-1.png" alt="Letterboxing and transform interaction 1" /></p>
<p>For example, with 100px letterboxing margins, and no transform applied to the presentation surface, the resulting buffer will be rendered without scale, and letterboxing margins will be 100px wide.</p>
<p><img src="images/letterboxing-and-transform-interaction-2.png" alt="Letterboxing and transform interaction 2" /></p>
<p>Another example, with 100px letterboxing margins, and a 2x scale transform applied on the presentation surface, the resulting buffer will be rendered with a 2x scale, and letterboxing margins seen on screen will still be 100px in all sizes.</p>
<p><img src="images/letterboxing-and-transform-interaction-3.png" alt="Letterboxing and transform interaction 3" /></p>
<p>Another example, with a 45 degree rotation transform, the resulting letterboxing margins will appear 100px, and the letterboxing margins will be rotated with the buffer.</p>
<p><img src="images/letterboxing-and-transform-interaction-4.png" alt="Letterboxing and transform interaction 4" /></p>
<p>Another example, with a scale 2x and rotation 45 degree transform, the image will be rotated and scaled, and letterboxing margins will also be 100px wide and be rotated with the buffer.</p>
<p><img src="images/letterboxing-and-transform-interaction-5.png" alt="Letterboxing and transform interaction 5" /></p>
<p>If a scale transform can't be extracted unambiguously from the transform that your application applies to the presentation surface, such as if the resulting X or Y scale is 0, the letterboxing margins will be rendered with the entire transform applied, and we won't attempt to compensate for the scale.</p>
<p><img src="images/letterboxing-and-transform-interaction-6.png" alt="Letterboxing and transform interaction 6" /></p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code> void SetContentLayoutAndFill(
    _In_ IPresentationSurface* pPresentationSurface)
{
    // Set layout properties. Each layout property is described below.

    // The source RECT describes the area from the bound buffer that will be sampled from. The
    // RECT is in source texture coordinates. Below we indicate that we'll sample from a
    // 100x100 area on the source texture.
    RECT sourceRect;
    sourceRect.left = 0;
    sourceRect.top = 0;
    sourceRect.right = 100;
    sourceRect.bottom = 100;
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationSurface-&gt;SetSourceRect(&amp;sourceRect));

    // The presentation transform defines how the source rect will be transformed when
    // rendering the buffer. In this case, we indicate we want to scale it 2x in both
    // width and height, and we also want to offset it 50 pixels to the right.
    PresentationTransform transform = { 0 };
    transform.M11 = 2.0f; // X scale 2x
    transform.M22 = 2.0f; // Y scale 2x
    transform.M31 = 50.0f; // X offset 50px
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationSurface-&gt;SetTransform(&amp;transform));

    // The letterboxing parameters describe how to letterbox the content. Letterboxing
    // is commonly used to fill area not covered by video/surface content when scaling to
    // an aspect ratio that doesn't match the aspect ratio of the surface itself. For
    // example, when viewing content formatted for the theater on a 1080p home screen, one
    // can typically see black &quot;bars&quot; on the top and bottom of the video, covering the space
    // on screen that wasn't covered by the video due to the differing aspect ratios of the
    // content and the display device. The composition swapchain API allows the user to specify
    // letterboxing margins, which describe the number of pixels to surround the surface
    // content with on screen. In this case, surround the top and bottom of our content with
    // 100 pixel tall letterboxing.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationSurface-&gt;SetLetterboxingMargins(
        0.0f,
        100.0f,
        0.0f,
        100.0f));
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 7—Setting content restrictions on a presentation surface</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would prevent other applications from reading back the contents of the presentation surface (from technologies such as PrintScreen, DDA, Capture API, and others) for the purposes of protected content. It also demonstrates how to limit display of a presentation surface to only a single DXGI output.</p>
<p>If content readback is disabled, then when your application attempts to read back, the captured image will contain opaque black in place of the presentation surface. If a presentation surface is display-limited to an <a href="/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nn-dxgi-idxgioutput"><strong>IDXGIOutput</strong></a>, then it will appear as opaque black on all other outputs.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void SetContentRestrictions(
    _In_ IPresentationSurface* pPresentationSurface,
    _In_ IDXGIOutput* pOutputToRestrictTo)
{
    // Disable readback of the surface via printscreen, bitblt, etc.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationSurface-&gt;SetDisableReadback(true));

    // Restrict display of surface to only the passed output.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationSurface-&gt;RestrictToOutput(pOutputToRestrictTo));
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 8—Adding presentation buffers to a presentation manager</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would allocate a set of Direct3D textures, and add them to the presentation manager to use as presentation buffers, which can be presented to presentation surfaces.</p>
<p>As mentioned, there are no restrictions around the number of presentation managers that a texture can be registered with. However, in most normal use cases, a texture will be registered only to a single presentation manager.</p>
<p>Also note that since the API accepts shared buffer handles as currency when registering textures as presentation buffers in the presentation manager, and since DXGI can create multiple shared buffers for a single texture2D, it's technically possible for your application to create multiple shared buffer handles for a single texture, and register them both with the presentation manager, essentially having the effect of adding the same buffer more than once. This is not advised, as it will break the synchronization mechanisms the presentation manager provides, as two presentation buffers tracked uniquely will actually correspond to the same texture. Since this is an advanced API, and since it is actually quite difficult in implementation to detect this case when it happens, the API doesn't attempt to validate this scenario.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void AddBuffersToPresentationManager(
    _In_ ID3D11Device* pD3D11Device, // The backing Direct3D device

<h2>Example 9—Removing presentation buffers from a presentation manager, and object lifetime</h2>
<p>Removing a presentation buffer from the presentation manager is as simple as releasing the IPresentationBuffer object to a 0 refcount. However, when this happens, it doesn't necessarily mean that the presentation buffer can be released. There may be cases when a buffer may still be in use, such as if that presentation buffer is visible on screen, or has outstanding presents that reference it.</p>
<p>In short, the presentation manager will keep track of how every buffer is being used by your application directly, and indirectly. It will keep track of what buffers are displayed, what presents are outstanding and reference buffers, and it will internally track all this state to make sure that a buffer isn't truly released/unregistered until it truly is no longer in use.</p>
<p>A good way to think about buffer lifetime is that if your application releases an IPresentationBuffer, it is telling the API that it will no longer use that buffer in any future calls. The composition swapchain API will be tracking this, as well as any other ways the buffer is being used, and it will fully release the buffer only when it is completely safe to do so.</p>
<p>In short—your application should release an <a href="/windows/win32/api/presentation/nn-presentation-ipresentationbuffer"><strong>IPresentationBuffer</strong></a> when it's done with it, and know that the composition swapchain API will fully release the buffer when all other uses have completed as well.</p>
<p>Here's an illustration of the concepts above.</p>
<p><img src="images/removing-presentation-buffers.png" alt="Removing presentation buffers" /></p>
<p>In this example, we have a presentation manager with two presentation buffers. Buffer 1 has three references keeping it alive.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application holds an <strong>IPresentationBuffer</strong> referencing it.</li>
<li>Internal to the API, it is being stored as the presentation surface's current bound buffer, as it was the last buffer your application bound, which it then presented.</li>
<li>There's also a present outstanding in the present queue intending to display buffer 1 on the presentation surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Buffer 1 is additionally holding a reference on its corresponding Direct3D texture allocation. Your application also has an <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d11/nn-d3d11-id3d11texture2d"><strong>ID3D11Texture2D</strong></a> referencing that allocation.</p>
<p>Buffer 2 has no more outstanding references from the application side, nor does the texture allocation it references, but buffer 2 is being kept alive because it is what is being displayed currently by the presentation surface on screen. When Present 1 is processed, and buffer 1 is displayed on screen instead, buffer 2 will have no more references, and it will be released, in turn releasing its reference on its Direct3D texture2D allocation.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void ReleasePresentationManagerBuffersExample(
    _In_ ID3D11Device* pD3D11Device,
    _In_ IPresentationManager* pPresentationManager)
{
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;ID3D11Texture2D&gt; texture2D;
    com_ptr_failfast&lt;IPresentationBuffer&gt; newBuffer;

    // Create a new texture/presentation buffer.
    AddNewPresentationBuffer(
        pD3D11Device,
        pPresentationManager,
        200, // Buffer width
        200, // Buffer height
        &amp;texture2D,
        &amp;newBuffer);

    // Release the IPresentationBuffer. This indicates that we have no more intention to use it
    // from the application side. However, if we have any presents outstanding that reference
    // the buffer, it will be kept alive internally and released when all outstanding presents
    // have been retired.
    newBuffer.reset();

    // When the presentation buffer is truly released internally, it will in turn release its
    // reference on the texture2D which it corresponds to. Your application must also release
    // its own references to the texture2D for it to be released.
    texture2D.reset();
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Example 10—Resizing buffers in a presentation manager</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application would perform a <em>resize</em> of the presentation buffers. For example, if a movie streaming service is streaming 480p but decides to switch formats to 1080p due to the availability of high network bandwidth, then it would want to reallocate its buffers from 480p to 1080p so that it could begin presenting 1080p content.</p>
<p>In DXGI, this is referred to as a <em>resize</em> operation. DXGI reallocates all buffers atomically, which is costly, and can produce glitching on screen. The example here describes how to achieve atomic resize on par with DXGI in the composition swapchain API. A later example will show how to do a resize in a <em>staggered</em> fashion, spacing out the reallocation across multiple presents, achieving better performance than an atomic swapchain resize.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void ResizePresentationManagerBuffersExample(
    _In_ ID3D11Device* pD3D11Device,
    _In_ IPresentationManager* pPresentationManager) // Previously-made presentation manager.
{
    // Vectors representing the IPresentationBuffer and ID3D11Texture2D collections.
    vector&lt;com_ptr_failfast&lt;ID3D11Texture2D&gt;&gt; textures;
    vector&lt;com_ptr_failfast&lt;IPresentationBuffer&gt;&gt; presentationBuffers;

    // Add 6 50x50 buffers to the presentation manager. See previous example for definition of
    // this function.
    AddBuffersToPresentationManager(
        pD3D11Device,
        pPresentationManager,
        50, // Buffer width
        50, // Buffer height
        6, // Number of buffers
        textures,
        presentationBuffers);

    // Release all the buffers we just added. The presentation buffers internally will be released
    // when any other references are also removed (outstanding presents, display references, etc.).
    textures.clear();
    presentationBuffers.clear();

    // Add 6 new 100x100 buffers to the presentation manager to replace the
    // old ones we just removed.
    AddBuffersToPresentationManager(
        pD3D11Device,
        pPresentationManager,
        100, // Buffer width
        100, // Buffer height
        6, // Number of buffers
        textures,
        presentationBuffers);

<h2>Example 11—Synchronizing presentation using buffer available events, and handling presentation manager lost events</h2>
<p>If your application is going to issue a present involving a presentation buffer that has been used in an earlier present, then you must ensure that the previous present is complete for rendering to and presenting the presentation buffer again. The composition swapchain API provides a couple of different mechanisms to facilitate this synchronization. The easiest is a presentation buffer's <em>available event</em>, which is an NT event object that is signaled when a buffer is available to use (that is, all previous presents have entered either the <em>retiring</em> or <em>retired</em> state) and unsignaled otherwise. This example illustrates how to use buffer available events to pick out available buffers to present. It also illustrates how to listen for <em>device lost</em> errors which are morally equivalent to DXGI device loss, and require a recreation of the presentation manager.</p>
<h3>Presentation manager lost errors</h3>
<p>A presentation manager can become lost if it encounters an error internally that it can't recover from. Your application must destroy a lost presentation manager, and create a new one to use instead. When a presentation manager becomes lost, it will stop accepting further presents. Any attempt to call <strong>Present</strong> on a lost presentation manager will return <strong>PRESENTATION_ERROR_LOST</strong>. All other methods, however, will function normally. This is to ensure that your application needs only to check for <strong>PRESENTATION_ERROR_LOST</strong> on present calls, and doesn't need to anticipate/handle lost errors on every API call. If your application wishes to check for, or be notified of, lost errors outside of a present call, then it can use the lost event returned by <a href="/windows/win32/api/presentation/nf-presentation-ipresentationmanager-getlostevent"><strong>IPresentationManager::GetLostEvent</strong></a>.</p>
<h3>Present queue and timing</h3>
<p>Presents issued by the presentation manager can specify a specific time to target. This target time is the ideal time that the system will attempt to show the present. Since screens update at a finite cadence, the present is unlikely to show up precisely at the specified time, but it will be shown as close to the time as it can.</p>
<p>This target time is a system-relative time, or the time the system has been running since it turned on, in hundreds-of-nanosecond units. An easy way to compute the current time is to query current <a href="/windows/win32/api/profileapi/nf-profileapi-queryperformancecounter"><strong>QueryPerformanceCounter</strong></a> (QPC) value, divide it by the system's QPC frequency, and multiply it by 10,000,000. Rounding and precision limits aside, this will compute the current time in applicable units. The system could also get the current time by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-mfgetsystemtime"><strong>MfGetSystemTime</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/win32/api/realtimeapiset/nf-realtimeapiset-queryinterrupttimeprecise"><strong>QueryInterruptTimePrecise</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Once the current time is known, your application will typically emit presents at increasing offsets from the current time.</p>
<p>Regardless of target time, presents are always processed in queue order. Even if a present targets an earlier time than the previous present, it will not be processed until after that previous present is processed. This essentially means that any present that doesn't target a later time than the one before it will override that previous present. It also means that if your application wants to issue a present <em>as early as possible</em>, then it can simply not set a target time (in which case the target time would remain what it was for the last present), or set a target time of 0. Both would have the same effect. If your application doesn't want to wait for previous presents to complete for a new present to take place, then it will need to cancel previous presents. A future example describes how to do this.</p>
<p><img src="images/present-queue-and-timing.png" alt="Present Queue and timing" /></p>
<p><strong>T=3s</strong>: Present 1, 2, 3 all ready, and 3, being the last present, wins out.
<strong>T=4s</strong>: Present 4, 5, 6 all ready, and 6, being the last present, wins out.</p>
<p>The diagram above illustrates an example of outstanding presents in the present queue. Present 1 targets a time of 3s. So no presents will take place until 3s. However, present 2 actually targets an earlier time, 2s, and present 3 targets 3s as well. As such, at time 3s, presents 1, 2, and 3 will all complete, and present 3 will be the present to actually take effect. Following that, the next present, 4, will be satisfied at 4s, but immediately be overridden by Present 5, which targets 0s, and Present 6, which has no target time set. Both 5 and 6 effective take effect <em>as early as possible</em>.</p>

<h2>Example 12—Advanced synchronization—throttling workflow to the size of the outstanding present queue using present synchronization fences, and handling presentation manager lost events</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how your application can submit a large number of presents for the future, and then sleep until the number of presents that are still outstanding drops to a specific quantity. Frameworks such as Windows Media Foundation throttle this way to minimize the number of CPU wakes that occur, while still ensuring that the present queue doesn't deplete (which would prevent smooth playback, and cause a glitch). This has the effect of minimizing CPU power usage during the presentation workflow. Your application will queue the maximum number of presents (based on the number of presentation buffers they've allocated), and then sleep until right before the present queue is depleted to refill the queue.</p>

<h2>Example 13—VSync interrupts and hardware flip queue support</h2>
<p>A new form of flip queue management called <em>hardware flip queue</em> has been introduced alongside this API, essentially allowing GPU hardware to manage presents completely independently of the CPU. The main benefit of this is power efficiency. When the CPU doesn't need to be involved in the presentation process, less power is drawn.</p>
<p>The downside to having the GPU handle presents independently is that CPU state can no longer immediately reflect when presents are shown. composition swapchain API concepts such as buffer available events, synchronization fences, and present statistics won't be updated immediately. Instead, the GPU will refresh only periodically the CPU state as to what presents have been shown. This means that feedback to applications regarding present status will come with a latency.</p>
<p>Your application will typically care when some presents are shown, but not care so much about other presents. For example, if your application issues 10 presents, it may decide that it wants to know when the 8th is shown, so it can begin refilling the present queue again. In this case, the only present it really wants feedback from is the 8th. It doesn't plan on doing anything when 1-7 or 9 are shown.</p>
<p>Whether presents update CPU state is dependent on whether the GPU hardware is configured to generate a VSync interrupt when that present is shown. This VSync interrupt awakens the CPU if it's not already active, and the CPU then runs special kernel-level code to update itself on the presents that have occurred on the GPU since the last time it checked, in turn updating feedback mechanisms such as buffer available events, the present retiring fence, and present statistics.</p>
<p>To allow your application to explicitly indicate which presents should issue a VSync interrupt, the presentation manager exposes a <a href="/windows/win32/api/presentation/nf-presentation-ipresentationmanager-forcevsyncinterrupt"><strong>IPresentationManager::ForceVSyncInterrupt</strong></a> method, which specifies whether or not subsequent presents should issue a VSync interrupt. This setting applies to all future presents until it is changed, much like <a href="/windows/win32/api/presentation/nf-presentation-ipresentationmanager-settargettime"><strong>IPresentationManager::SetTargetTime</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/presentation/nf-presentation-ipresentationmanager-setpreferredpresentduration"><strong>IPresentationManager::SetPreferredPresentDuration</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If this setting is enabled on a particular present, then the hardware will immediately notify the CPU when that present is shown, using more power, but ensuring that the CPU is immediately notified when a present takes place in order to allow applications to respond as quickly as possible. If this setting is disabled on a particular present, then the system will be allowed to defer updating the CPU when the present is shown—saving power, but deferring feedback.</p>
<p>Your application will typically not force the VSync interrupt for any presents except a present it wants to synchronize with. In the example above, since your application wanted to wake up when the 8th present was shown to refill its present queue, it would request that present 8 signals a VSync interrupt, but presents 1-7 and present 9 don't.</p>
<p>By default, if your application doesn't configure this setting, then the presentation manager will always signal the VSync interrupt when every present is shown. Applications that are not concerned about power usage, or not aware of hardware flip queue support, can simply not call <strong>ForceVSyncInterrupt</strong>, and they'll be guaranteed to synchronize properly as a result. Applications that are aware of hardware flip queue support can explicitly control this setting for improved power efficiency.</p>

<h2>Example 14—Canceling presents scheduled for the future</h2>
<p>Media applications that deeply queue presents for the future might decide to cancel presents they've previously issued. This may happen, for example, if your application is playing back a video, has issued a large number of frames for the future, and the user decides to pause video playback. In this case, your application will want to stick to the current frame, and cancel any future frames that haven't yet become queued. This may also happen if a media application decides to move playback to a different point in the video. In this case, your application will want to cancel all presents that have not yet become queued for the old position in the video, and replace them with presents for the new position. In this case, after canceling previous presents, your application can issue new presents in the future corresponding to the new point in the video.</p>
<h3>C++ example</h3>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>void PresentCancelExample(
    _In_ IPresentationManager* pPresentationManager,
    _In_ UINT64 firstPresentIDToCancelFrom)

{
    // Assume we've issued a number of presents in the future. Something happened in the app, and
    // we want to cancel the issued presents that occur after a specified time or present ID. This
    // may happen, for example, when the user pauses playback from inside a media application. The
    // application will want to cancel all presents posted targeting beyond the pause time. The
    // cancel will apply to all previously posted presents whose present IDs are at least
    // 'firstPresentIDToCancelFrom'. Note that Present IDs are always unique, and never recycled,
    // so even if a present is canceled, no subsequent present will ever reuse its present ID.
    //
    // Also note that if some presents we attempt to cancel can't be canceled because they've
    // already started queueing, then no error will be returned, they simply won't be canceled as
    // requested. Cancelation takes a &quot;best effort&quot; approach.
    FAIL_FAST_IF_FAILED(pPresentationManager-&gt;CancelPresentsFrom(firstPresentIDToCancelFrom));

    // In the case where the media application scrubbed to a different position in the video, it may now
    // choose to issue new presents to replace the ones canceled. This is not illustrated here, but
    // previous examples that demonstrate presentation show how this may be achieved.

<h2>Example 15—Staggered buffer resize operation for improved performance</h2>
<p>This example illustrates how your application can stagger buffer resizes for improved performance over DXGI. Recall our previous resize example, wherein a movie streaming service client wishes to change playback resolution from 720p to 1080p. In DXGI, the application would perform a resize operation on the DXGI swapchain, which would atomically throw away all previous buffers, and reallocate all new 1080p buffers at once, and add them to the swapchain. This type of atomic resize of buffers is expensive, and has the potential to take a long time and cause glitches. The new API provides finer control over individual presentation buffers. As such, buffers can be reallocated and replaced one-by-one across multiple presents to split the workload over time. This has less of an impact on any one present and is much less likely to cause glitching. Essentially, for a presentation manager with n presentation buffers, for â€˜n' presents, your application can remove an old presentation buffer at the old size, allocate a new presentation buffer at the new size, and present it. After â€˜n' presents, all buffers will be at the new size.</p>

<h2>Example 16—Reading and processing present statistics</h2>
<p>The API reports present statistics for each present that's submitted. At a high level, present statistics are a feedback mechanism that describes how a particular present was processed or shown by the system. There are different types of statistics which your application can register to receive, and the statistics infrastructure in the API itself is meant to be expandable, so more types of statistics can be added in the future. This API describes how to read back statistics, and describes the types of statistics defined today, and what information they convey at a high level.</p>

<h2>Example 17—using an abstraction layer to present using either the new composition swapchain API or DXGI from your application</h2>
<p>Given the higher system/driver requirements of the new composition swapchain API, your application might wish to use DXGI in cases when the new API is not supported.

<h1>OnlineDevice method of the CIM_LogicalDevice class</h1>
<p>The OnlineDevice method has been deprecated in lieu of the more general RequestStateChange method that directly overlaps with the functionality provided by this method.</p>
<p>Requests that the LogicalDevice be brought online (&quot;Online&quot; input parameter = TRUE) or taken offline (= FALSE). &quot;Online&quot; indicates that the Device is ready to accept requests, and is operational and fully functioning. In this case, the Device\'s Availability property would be set to a value of 3 (&quot;Running/Full Power&quot;). &quot;Offline&quot; indicates that a Device is powered up and operational, but not processing functional requests. In an offline state, a Device may be capable of running diagnostics or generating operational alerts. For example, when the &quot;Offline&quot; button is pushed on a Printer, the Device is no longer available to process print jobs, but could be available for diagnostics or maintenance.</p>
<p>If this method is successful, the Device\'s Availability and AdditionalAvailability properties should reflect the updated status. If a failure occurs trying to bring the Device online or offline, it should remain in its current state. IE, the request, if unsuccessful, should not leave the Device in an indeterminate state. When bringing a Device back &quot;Online&quot;, from an &quot;Offline&quot; mode, the Device should be restored to its last &quot;Online&quot; state, if at all possible. Only a Device that has an EnabledState/StatusInfo of &quot;Enabled&quot; and has been configured can be brought online or taken offline.</p>
<p>OnlineDevice should return 0 if successful, 1 if the request is not supported at all, 2 if the request is not supported due to the current state of the Device, and some other value if any other error occurred. In a subclass, the set of possible return codes could be specified, using a ValueMap qualifier on the method. The strings to which the ValueMap contents are \'translated\' may also be specified in the subclass as a Values array qualifier.</p>
<p>Note that this method\'s function overlaps with the RequestedState property. RequestedState was added to the model to maintain a record (i.e., a persisted value) of the last state request. Invoking the OnlineDevice method should set the RequestedState property appropriately.</p>

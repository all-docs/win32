<h1>Dynamic-Link Library Data</h1>
<p>A Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) can contain global data or local data.</p>
<h2>Variable Scope</h2>
<p>Variables that are declared as global in a DLL source code file are treated as global variables by the compiler and linker, but each process that loads a given DLL gets its own copy of that DLL's global variables. The scope of static variables is limited to the block in which the static variables are declared. As a result, each process has its own instance of the DLL global and static variables by default.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Your development tools may allow you to override the default behavior. For example, the Visual C++ compiler supports <strong>#pragma section</strong> and the linker supports the /SECTION option. For more information, see the documentation included with your development tools.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>
<p>When a DLL allocates memory using any of the memory allocation functions (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-globalalloc"><strong>GlobalAlloc</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-localalloc"><strong>LocalAlloc</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/heapapi/nf-heapapi-heapalloc"><strong>HeapAlloc</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc"><strong>VirtualAlloc</strong></a>), the memory is allocated in the virtual address space of the calling process and is accessible only to the threads of that process.</p>
<p>A DLL can use file mapping to allocate memory that can be shared among processes. For a general discussion of how to use file mapping to create named shared memory, see <a href="/windows/desktop/Memory/file-mapping">File Mapping</a>. For an example that uses the <a href="dllmain.html"><strong>DllMain</strong></a> function to set up shared memory using file mapping, see <a href="using-shared-memory-in-a-dynamic-link-library.html">Using Shared Memory in a Dynamic-Link Library</a>.</p>
<h2>Thread Local Storage</h2>
<p>The thread local storage (TLS) functions enable a DLL to allocate an index for storing and retrieving a different value for each thread of a multithreaded process. For example, a spreadsheet application can create a new instance of the same thread each time the user opens a new spreadsheet. A DLL providing the functions for various spreadsheet operations can use TLS to save information about the current state of each spreadsheet (row, column, and so on). For a general discussion of thread local storage, see <a href="/windows/desktop/ProcThread/thread-local-storage">Thread Local Storage</a>. For an example that uses the <a href="dllmain.html"><strong>DllMain</strong></a> function to set up thread local storage, see <a href="using-thread-local-storage-in-a-dynamic-link-library.html">Using Thread Local Storage in a Dynamic-Link Library</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP:</strong> The Visual C++ compiler supports a syntax that enables you to declare thread-local variables: <strong>_declspec(thread)</strong>. If you use this syntax in a DLL, you will not be able to load the DLL explicitly using <a href="/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya"><strong>LoadLibrary</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/LibLoaderAPI/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryexa"><strong>LoadLibraryEx</strong></a> on versions of Windows prior to WindowsÂ Vista. If your DLL will be loaded explicitly, you must use the thread local storage functions instead of <strong>_declspec(thread)</strong>.</p>

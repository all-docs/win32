<h1>Disabling Shortcut Keys in Games</h1>
<p>This articles describes how to temporarily disable keyboard shortcuts in Microsoft Windows to prevent disruption of game play for full screen games. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SHIFT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CTRL<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key are often used as fire or run buttons in games. If users accidentally press the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key (located near these keys), they can cause themselves to suddenly jump out of the application, which ruins the game experience. Simply using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SHIFT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key as a game button can inadvertently execute the StickyKeys shortcut which may display a warning dialog. To avoid these issues, you should disable these keys when running in full-screen mode, and either enable the keys back to their default handlers when running in windowed mode or exit the application.</p>
<p>This article describes how to do the following:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Disable the Windows Key with a Keyboard Hook</h2>
<p>Use a low-level keyboard hook to filter out the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key from being processed. The low-level keyboard hook shown in Example 1 remains in effect even if a user minimizes the window or switches to another application. This means that you must be careful to ensure that the Windows key is not disabled when the application is deactivated. The code in Example 1 does this by handling the WM_ACTIVATEAPP message.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
This method works on Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows. This method also works with least-privileged user accounts (also known as Standard User accounts).</p>

<p>This method is used by <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DXUT">DXUT</a> and is illustrated in the following code example.</p>

    //

    // 
 
    // Cleanup before shutdown
    UnhookWindowsHookEx( g_hKeyboardHook );

<h2>Disable the Accessibility Shortcut Keys</h2>
<p>Windows includes accessibility features such as StickyKeys, FilterKeys, and ToggleKeys (see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessibility/features">Windows Accessibility</a>). Each of these serves a different purpose; StickyKeys for example, is designed for people who have difficulty holding down two or more keys simultaneously. Each of these accessibility features also has a keyboard shortcut that allows the feature to be turned on or off. For example, the StickyKeys shortcut is triggered by pressing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SHIFT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key five times. If the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SHIFT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> key is also used in the game, the user could accidentally trigger this shortcut during game play. When the shortcut is triggered, Windows (by default) presents a warning in a dialog box, which would cause Windows to minimize a game running in full-screen mode. This, of course, can have a drastic effect on game play.</p>
<p>The accessibility features are required for some customers and do not themselves interfere with full-screen games; therefore, you should not change the accessibility settings. However, because the shortcuts for accessibility features can disrupt game play if triggered accidentally, you should turn off an accessibility shortcut only when that feature is not enabled by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-systemparametersinfow"><strong>SystemParametersInfo</strong></a>.</p>
<p>An accessibility shortcut that is turned off by <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-systemparametersinfow"><strong>SystemParametersInfo</strong></a> remains turned off even after the application has exited. This means that you must restore the settings before exiting the application. Because it is possible for the application to fail to exit correctly, you should write these settings to persistent storage so that they can be restored when the application is run again. You could also use an exception handler to restore these settings if a crash occurs.</p>
<p><strong>To turn off these shortcuts</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Capture the current accessibility settings before disabling them.</li>
<li>Disable the accessibility shortcut when the application goes into full-screen mode if the accessibility feature is off.</li>
<li>Restore the accessibility settings when the application goes into windowed mode or exits.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Conflicts Between Application Gestures and Characters and Symbols</h1>
<p>Some application gestures may conflict with characters, combinations of characters, symbols, combinations of characters and symbols or whole words written in a single stroke. Most of these conflicts are avoided by having a detailed understanding of the context in which the application gesture is performed.</p>
<p>For example, to distinguish a right gesture from a dash (-) or an underscore (_), an application may filter for how close the gesture is to neighboring characters, the relative size as compared to characters, or other information contained in a packet. The timing of the application gesture may also be a determining factor in deciding between gestures and characters. There may be more of a pause before applying an application gesture than before inputting characters. Unless a user is performing a series of undo or backspace gestures, there may also be more of a pause after a gesture than a character.</p>

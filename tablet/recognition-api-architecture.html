<h1>Recognition API Architecture</h1>
<p>An ink-enabled application communicates with the recognition system through the Tablet PC Platform APIs. Applications use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/nn-msinkaut-iinkrecognizer"><strong>IInkRecognizer</strong></a> object to accomplish this. The Tablet PC Platform interacts with your recognizer by using the C-style interfaces that are documented in this section. In the following illustration, the area inside the dashed line shows what is documented in this section.</p>

<p>A custom recognizer must include Recapis.h (installed by default in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Tablet PC Platform SDK\Include). Except where noted, your dynamic-link library (DLL) must export all of the API functions, even if you choose to have some of them return E_NOTIMPL.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances will your recognizer be called directly by an ink-enabled application. Instead, applications will call either the Automation APIs or the Managed APIs to get results from your recognizer.</p>

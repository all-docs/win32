<h1>Substandard Techniques for Exposing Custom Controls</h1>
<p>If an application does not support Microsoft Active Accessibility, it may not be fully accessible. The following techniques render controls partially compatible:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Return a descriptive string when the control is queried by using the WM_GETTEXT message. For example, allow a custom equivalent of a button control labeled &quot;Print&quot; to return the string &quot;Print button.&quot; This identifies both control type and label. The same string is appropriate for a button with a label that is something other than text, such as a graphic of a printer. Similarly, allow a custom control that behaves like a check box to return the caption string &quot;Printing Enabled check box, checked.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the WM_GETDLGCODE message, identifying the keyboard input that is supported. For example, allow a custom equivalent of an edit control to handle WM_GETDLGCODE by returning DLGC_HASSETSEL if it handles messages to set the selection, DLGC_WANTARROWS if it uses arrow keys, and DLGC_WANTCHARS to indicate that it uses character input.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Only controls that have their own window handles can respond to the WM_GETTEXT and WM_GETDLGCODE messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid compatibility problems with accessibility aids, you should follow Active Accessibility guidelines closely when designing custom controls.

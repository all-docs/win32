<h1>Exposing Text Programmatically</h1>
<p>Exposing text programmatically provides a great benefit to accessibility aids, by providing a much more reliable-and in some cases richer-interpretation of the information.</p>
<p>There are several basic methods of exposing objects to expose text programmatically. However, no method is effective with all accessibility aids, so it is also necessary to draw text to the screen so it can be recognized. For information about exposing large amounts text, see <a href="using-active-accessibility-to-expose-text.html">Using Active Accessibility to Expose Text</a>.</p>

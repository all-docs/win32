<h1>Working with the StylusInput APIs</h1>
<p>The <a href="realtimestylus-class.html"><strong>RealTimeStylus</strong></a> class enables you to interact with the data stream from the tablet pen. To interact with the data stream, add a <strong>RealTimeStylus</strong> object to your application, and add plug-ins to the <strong>RealTimeStylus</strong> object.</p>
<p>The plug-ins can modify the data associated with in-air packets, stylus down, packets, and stylus up notification methods. The plug-ins can cancel the in-air packets and packets notification methods. The plug-ins can also add application data to the stream in the form of <a href="/previous-versions/ms575208(v=vs.100)">CustomStylusData</a> objects. The following list offers ideas for common categories of plug-ins that you may want to use or create.</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter plug-in: An object that selectively removes or cancels data in the tablet pen data stream.</li>
<li>Modifier plug-in: An object that selectively modifies data in the tablet pen data stream.</li>
<li>Dynamic-renderer plug-in: An object that displays the tablet pen data in real-time as it is being handled by the <a href="realtimestylus-class.html"><strong>RealTimeStylus</strong></a> object. Later, for events such as a form refresh, the dynamic renderer plug-in or an ink collection plug-in might redraw the ink.</li>
<li>Recognizer plug-in: An object that scans the movement of the tablet pen for gestures, handwriting, or other glyphs.</li>
<li>Ink-collector plug-in: An object that from the tablet pen data stream creates and stores ink.</li>
<li>Wrapper plug-in: A plug-in that acts as an interface between the <a href="realtimestylus-class.html"><strong>RealTimeStylus</strong></a> object and another plug-in or object as a way of modifying the behavior of the wrapped object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both dynamic-renderer and ink-collection plug-ins can be created to render to various contextsâ€”such as to a file, a stream, or to a display device. Ink can also be stored in various formats, such as an <a href="/previous-versions/aa515768(v=msdn.10)">Ink</a> object, a fortified Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) file, an Ink Serialized Format (ISF) file, or other formats.</p>
<p>Two plug-ins are provided with the StylusInput APIs: the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms701168(v=vs.85)"><strong>DynamicRenderer</strong></a> class and the <a href="gesturerecognizer-class.html"><strong>GestureRecognizer</strong></a> class. The <strong>DynamicRenderer</strong> class provides basic rendering of the ink data in real time and is streamlined to have a minimal performance impact. The <strong>GestureRecognizer</strong> class provides gesture recognition for the <a href="realtimestylus-class.html"><strong>RealTimeStylus</strong></a> class.</p>

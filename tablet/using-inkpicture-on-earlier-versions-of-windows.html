<h1>Using InkPicture on Earlier Versions of Windows</h1>
<p>You can use the <a href="inkpicture-control.html">InkPicture Control</a> to render ink on Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and non-Tablet PC editions of Windows XP. However, you cannot use the control to input ink on these operating systems.</p>
<p>The control's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/nf-msinkaut-iinkpicture-get_inkenabled"><strong>InkEnabled</strong></a> property is set to <strong>FALSE</strong>, and attempting to change the property has no effect. You can assign values to other properties and programmatically manipulate ink, but you cannot use the control to collect ink.</p>

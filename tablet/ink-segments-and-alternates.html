<h1>Ink Segments and Alternates</h1>
<p>A recognizer may find several ways to break an ink sample into recognition segments. Because of this, the number of recognition alternates may be staggering, even for a small ink sample.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;t o g e t h e r&quot; can yield the following results:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;to get her&quot; (plus alternates for each word)</li>
<li>&quot;to gather&quot; (plus alternates for each word)</li>
<li>&quot;tog ether&quot; (plus alternates for each word)</li>
<li>&quot;tog at her&quot; (plus alternates for each word)</li>
<li>&quot;together&quot; (plus alternates for the word)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/nn-msinkaut-iinkrecognitionresult"><strong>RecognitionResult</strong></a> object supports efficient storage of full recognition results within the <a href="inkdisp-class.html"><strong>Ink</strong></a> object. The <strong>Ink</strong> object maps the recognition alternates to the strokes in the <strong>Ink</strong> object and may also contain other information such as baseline position, line indices, and language ranges.</p>

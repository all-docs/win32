<h1>Recognizer Threading Considerations</h1>
<p>Although aÂ <a href="hrecocontext-handle.html">recognizer context</a>Â cannot be accessed on two threads simultaneously by the Tablet PC platform, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/recapis/nf-recapis-adviseinkchange"><strong>AdviseInkChange</strong></a> function can be called at any time on any thread. Because the Tablet PC platform does not ensure that there is only one recognizer context at a time, two separate recognizer contexts in separate threads may simultaneously attempt to access your <a href="hrecognizer-handle.html">recognizer</a>. Therefore, global variables in your recognition engine must be thread-safe.</p>
<p>Word lists are an optional implementation used to increase accuracy. If your recognizer implements word lists, it must be thread-safe. For more information about using word lists, see <a href="using-application-dictionaries.html">Using Application Dictionaries</a>.</p>
<p>For details about other threading considerations, see <a href="tablet-pc-threading-considerations.html">Tablet PC Threading Considerations</a>.</p>

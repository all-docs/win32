<h1>About Language Models</h1>
<p>Handwriting recognizers use a defined set of rules for a given language as the primary context for recognizing words. These rules are called language models. The language model is implemented by the recognizer and cannot be directly changed by a developer using the Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Software Development Kit (SDK). However, there are ways to refine the context for specific fields in an application. These techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input scopes</li>
<li>Factoids</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Phrase lists</li>
</ul>

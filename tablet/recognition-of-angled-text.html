<h1>Recognition of Angled Text</h1>
<p>The Microsoft recognizers handle writing at an angle of +/- 20 degrees, but accuracy degrades as the writing deviates further from ideal horizontal. For ink written at more than twenty degrees off the horizontal axis, it is recommended that the developer rotate the ink back to horizontal before passing to the recognizer.</p>

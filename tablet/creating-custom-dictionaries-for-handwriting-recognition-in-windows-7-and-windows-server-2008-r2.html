<h1>Creating Custom Dictionaries for Handwriting Recognition in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2</h1>
<p>This section explains how to create a custom dictionary for handwriting recognition.</p>
<p>In the Windows 7 operating system and the Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system, the accuracy of handwriting recognition can be significantly improved through the use of custom dictionaries. These dictionaries supplement or replace system dictionaries used for handwriting. Support for handwriting recognition is provided through the Ink and Handwriting Services feature that needs to be enabled through Server Manager.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Custom dictionaries can be installed for a language only if the handwriting recognizer for that language is installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two basic steps to setting up a custom dictionary for handwriting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile a word list. The compilation creates a compiled custom dictionary (.hwrdict) file.</li>
<li>Install the compiled custom dictionary.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling a Word List</h2>
<p>The word list to be compiled must be in plain-text format and should be saved using a Unicode encoding. Other encodings will not work. Each line of the text file is taken as a single entry in the dictionary. Multiword units entries containing one or more spaces are allowed. Spaces at the beginning or end of a line are ignored.</p>
<p>A custom dictionary is compiled from a command line. To compile a dictionary, open a command window, navigate to the folder containing the word list, and then run HwrComp.exe with the command-line options you want to use.</p>
<p>The following example shows the usage syntax for the command-line options.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>Usage: hwrcomp       [-lang &lt;localename&gt;] [-type &lt;type&gt;]
    [-comment &lt;comment&gt;]
    [-o &lt;dictfile.hwrdict&gt;]
    &lt;inputfile&gt;
     
</code></pre>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Replacing a system dictionary does nothing to the original system dictionary content, as the replacement is in effect only until the custom dictionary has been removed.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> If a type value starts with the prefix SECONDARY, the compiled dictionary will supplement the system dictionary without replacing it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3>Defaults</h3>
<p>If no parameters are specified, the default option values are</p>
<p>-lang &lt;current input language&gt; -type SECONDARY-DICTIONARY</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following compiles the input file mylist1.txt, applies the default option values, and creates the output file mylist1.hwrdict.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>hwrcomp mylist1.txt
</code></pre>
<p>In contrast, the following compiles mylist1.txt into myrsrc1.hwrdict, but assigns &quot;English (US)&quot; (en-US) as the language and SECONDARY-DICTIONARY as the type.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>hwrcomp -lang en-US -type SECONDARY-DICTIONARY -o myrsrc1 mylist1.txt 
</code></pre>
<h2>Installing a Compiled Custom Dictionary</h2>
<p>HwrComp.exe creates a .hwrdict file, which is in a binary format usable by a handwriting recognizer. This file can be installed on any computer running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 that supports handwriting recognition. A dictionary is installed either for just the current user or for all users on a machine.</p>
<p>A compiled custom dictionary file can be installed from the command line using the tool HwrReg.exe. This tool is useful if you wish to override some of the configuration values that either are compiled into the file or are the default values. There are two ways to run HwrReg.exe: in check/install mode and in list/remove mode.</p>
<h3>Running HwrReg.exe in Check/Install Mode</h3>
<p>This mode is for custom dictionary files that have not yet been installed. The following shows the usage syntax for the command-line options.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>Usage: hwrreg        [-check]
    [-lang &lt;localename&gt;] 
    [-scope {all|me}]
    [-noprompt] 
    &lt;dictfile.hwrdict&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation of Options</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>-check</td>
<td>The dictionary file is verified without being installed. The  check option displays the file's comment, plus the registration information that would be used to install the file. This option is useful for verifying registration information before the installation is performed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, HwrReg.exe installs the custom dictionary.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>lang &lt;localename&gt;</td>
<td>The dictionary file is verified without being installed. The  check option displays the file's comment, plus the registration information that would be used to install the file. This option is useful for verifying registration information before the installation is performed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, HwrReg.exe installs the custom dictionary. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>scope {all|me}</td>
<td>The custom dictionary is installed either for all users ( scope all) or for just the current user ( scope me). Installing with  scope all requires the command to be run in an elevated command prompt; otherwise, an error code will be returned. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, the installation is scoped to just the current user.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>noprompt</td>
<td>HwrReg.exe does not prompt for confirmation. This can be useful when running hwrReg.exe from a script. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The following example installs the custom dictionary myrsrc1.hwrdict for language &quot;Danish (Denmark)&quot; (da DK), with the default scope of just the current user.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>hwrreg -lang da-DK myrsrc1.hwrdict 
</code></pre>
<h3>Running HwrReg.exe in List/Remove Mode</h3>
<p>This mode either lists or removes installed custom dictionaries. The following shows the usage syntax for the command-line options.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>Usage: hwrreg        [-lang &lt;localename&gt;] 
    [-scope {all|me}] 
    [-type &lt;type&gt;]
    -list | -remove
</code></pre>
<h3>Explanation of Options</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>lang &lt;localename&gt;</td>
<td>The dictionaries registered for only this locale name are listed or removed. The argument &lt;localename&gt; has the form language REGION. For examples of this form, see <a href="/windows/desktop/Intl/language-identifier-constants-and-strings">Language Identifier Constants and Strings</a>. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, dictionaries for all languages are listed or removed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>scope {all|me}</td>
<td>The custom dictionary is installed either for all users ( scope all) or for just the current user ( scope me). Installing with  scope all requires the command to be run in an elevated command prompt; otherwise, an error code will be returned. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, the installation is scoped to just the current user.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>type &lt;type&gt;</td>
<td>Lists or removes only dictionaries that are registered with the specified type.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, all dictionary types are listed or removed. Installing or removing a custom dictionary of another type (such as PRIMARY-COUNTRYNAME-LIST) may affect handwriting recognition in other contexts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>list</td>
<td>Lists all installed dictionaries that match the other options.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, the option  remove must be specified.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>remove</td>
<td>Prompts for removal of any dictionary that matches the other options.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If this option is missing, the option  list must be specified.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following lists dictionaries that have language &quot;English (US)&quot; (en US) and type PRIMARY DICTIONARY and that are installed for just the current user.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>hwrreg -list -lang en-US -type PRIMARY-DICTIONARY
                  
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the following removes dictionaries that match the same criteria.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>hwrreg -remove -lang en-US -type PRIMARY-DICTIONARY
                  
</code></pre>
<h2>General Notes on Custom Dictionaries</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you install two custom dictionaries that have the same type, language, and scope, the second installation will overwrite the first.</li>
<li>If you install two custom dictionaries with the same type and language, but with different scopes (one for all users, and one for the current user), the dictionary installed for the current user takes precedence, and the dictionary installed for all users is ignored.</li>
</ul>

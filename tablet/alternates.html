<h1>Alternates</h1>
<p>An alternate is a potential word match for a recognition segment. A recognizer generates alternates and bases them on acceptable matches of the ink or audio input against a dictionary or factoid.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Confidence evaluation is currently available only for the Microsoft English (United States) and gesture recognizers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Sometimes the ink may have ambiguous distinctions between segments. The recognizer compares these segments to a recognizer dictionary to determine possible matches. When the recognizer compares the segments, it maintains a list of possible alternate matches and assigns a confidence level to each one, picking a top choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The recognizer cannot provide alternates for a portion of ink that is smaller than a recognition segment.</p>

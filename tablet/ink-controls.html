<h1>Ink Controls</h1>
<p>The Tablet PC platform provides two controls, <a href="inkedit-control.html">InkEdit</a> and <a href="inkpicture-control.html">InkPicture</a>, which enable you to easily add ink and handwriting recognition to Tablet PC applications. The InkEdit control has <a href="/previous-versions/ms835842(v=msdn.10)">managed</a>, <a href="inkedit-control-reference.html">ActiveX</a> , and Win32 versions, while InkPicture has only the managed <a href="/previous-versions/ms583740(v=vs.100)">InkPicture</a> and <a href="inkpicture-control-reference.html">ActiveX</a> versions.</p>
<p>The key difference between the controls is in how data is saved. The <a href="inkedit-control.html">InkEdit</a> control saves ink as text by default, while <a href="inkpicture-control.html">InkPicture</a> saves ink as ink.</p>
<p>The <a href="inkedit-control.html">InkEdit</a> control is intended for text entry through handwriting recognition. <a href="inkpicture-control.html">InkPicture</a> is intended for annotation (for example, marking up a presentation slide or other picture).</p>
<p>In managed code, create ink controls in the same thread as the main thread for the form. If an <a href="inkedit-control.html">InkEdit</a> or <a href="inkpicture-control.html">InkPicture</a> control is created in a different thread, then your application may not respond properly.</p>
<p>You should explicitly change the threading model to single-thread apartment (STA) before creating an ink control. This causes the control to be created on the main thread. You can use the following Managed C++ code to explicitly set the threading model.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>Thread::get_CurrentThread()-&gt;set_ApartmentState(ApartmentState::STA);
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the following code to do the same thing in C#.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ApartmentState = System.Threading.ApartmentState.STA;
</code></pre>
<p>In managed code, to avoid a memory leak you must explicitly call the <a href="/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.form.dispose?view=netcore-3.1&amp;preserve-view=true">Dispose</a> method on any Tablet PC control to which an event handler has been attached before the control goes out of scope.</p>

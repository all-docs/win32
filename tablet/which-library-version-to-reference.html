<h1>Which Library Version to Reference</h1>
<p>This topic describes the differences between the Tablet PC library binary versions.</p>
<h2>Tablet PC Library Versions</h2>
<p>The Tablet PC library binaries (Microsoft.Ink.dll) have been updated in Windows Vista. Theses binaries are referred to as &quot;version 6.0&quot; to co-incide with the version of Windows in which they are being released.</p>
<p>The most recent release of the binaries that are compatible with Windows XP is referred to as &quot;version 1.7&quot;.</p>
<p>The Windows SDK can be installed on both Vista and XP machines, and the Windows SDK includes both versions of Microsoft.Ink.dll.</p>
<p>These are installed in:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>%programfiles%\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Tablet PC\v1.7\Microsoft.Ink.dll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>%programfiles%\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Tablet PC\v6.0\Microsoft.Ink.dll</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The version 6.0 binaries are only compatible with Windows Vista, and applications written against them should only ever be run on Windows Vista.</p>
<p>An application written against the version 1.7 binaries should run without modification when installed on Windows Vista.</p>

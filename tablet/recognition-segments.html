<h1>Recognition Segments</h1>
<p>A recognition segment is the basic ink unit that a recognizer uses internally to produce a recognition result for a particular Ink object. A recognition segment is a collection of ink strokes. For example, a recognizer that is capable of recognizing English cursive handwriting might use a word as the basic recognition segment.</p>
<p>Other recognizers may use parts of composite words as basic segments. For example, in Spanish, short words are commonly combined to provide longer composite words. &quot;Damelo&quot; is a Spanish word that is composed of three words &quot;da me lo&quot; (give me that), but it is written as a single word. A Spanish recognizer could recognize each subword as a segment.</p>
<p>A recognizer may find several ways to break an ink sample into recognition segments. Because ambiguity is involved in recognizing the user's intended input, the recognizer can return many alternate matches.</p>
<p>For more information about alternates, see <a href="alternates.html">Alternates</a>.</p>

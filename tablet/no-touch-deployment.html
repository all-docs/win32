<h1>No Touch Deployment</h1>
<p>The Microsoft .NET Framework gives you the ability to deploy applications from a Web or file server. This technique, called &quot;no-touch deployment&quot;, combines the performance and interactivity of a smart client application with all the deployment advantages of a Web application. To deploy your application over the Web, right-click the folder that contains your executable and select <strong>Properties</strong>. On the <strong>Web Sharing</strong> tab, select <strong>Share this folder</strong>. Enter an alias for the folder. Now, your executable can be run over the Web by using that alias as the directory on your server. For more information on no-touch deployment, see <a href="/archive/msdn-magazine/2002/july/net-zero-deployment-security-and-versioning-models-in-the-windows-forms-engine-help-you-create-and-deploy-smart-clients">.NET Smart Clients</a> and <a href="/docs/?url=%2flibrary%2fdv_vstechart%2fhtml%2fvbtchno-touchdeploymentinnetframework.asp">No-Touch Deployment in the .NET Framework</a>.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
You must have Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) installed on your computer to enable the <strong>Web Sharing</strong> tab in the <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box.</p>

<p>No-touch deployment is applied to ink-enabled applications in the same way as any other Windows Forms application. The samples provided by the Microsoft Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Software Development Kit (SDK) include a no-touch deployment version of the Auto Claims sample, in the Ink Web Samples section of the samples. This example takes the original <a href="auto-claims-form-sample.html">Auto Claims Form Sample</a> and provides an installer that puts in on a Web share. When Microsoft Internet Explorer navigates to AutoClaims.exe in the directory that maps to the Web share, the application is launched. See <a href="no-touch-deployment-web-sample.html">No-Touch Deployment Web Sample</a> for more information about the sample.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
When you deploy a .NET application over the Web, the application may be affected by the .NET security model. The <a href="security-and-trust.html">Security and Trust</a> section describes how security works with ink-enabled Web applications.</p>

<h1>Typical Calling Sequence</h1>
<p>The methods you must implement to create an ink recognizer are called by the Tablet PC Platform APIs and not directly by an ink-enabled application.</p>
<p>The following steps represent a typical calling sequence for the implementation of these methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>The DLL is loaded.</li>
<li>AnÂ <a href="hrecognizer-handle.html">HRECOGNIZER</a> handle is created.</li>
<li>AnÂ <a href="hrecocontext-handle.html">HRECOCONTEXT</a> handle is created.</li>
<li>Recognizer options and modes are set for this context.</li>
<li>Strokes are added to the ink data.</li>
<li>Input is ended.</li>
<li>The ink is recognized.</li>
<li>The recognition results are returned.</li>
<li>The <a href="hrecocontext-handle.html">HRECOCONTEXT</a> handle is destroyed.</li>
<li>The <a href="hrecognizer-handle.html">HRECOGNIZER</a> handle is destroyed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The calling sequence is also illustrated in the following code outline:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>CreateRecognizer(CLSID, &amp;hrec);
while (more pieces of ink to recognize ... )
{
  // Create a context, once per piece of ink to be recognized
  hrc = CreateContext(hrec, &amp;hrc);

  // Functions to set up options and modes for this context
  SetGuide(hrc, pGuide, 0);
  SetFactoid(hrc, 5, PHONE); // only if in application with forms
  SetFlags(hrc, RECOFLAG_WORDMODE); // rare, only if wanting word mode, no out-of-dictionary, or single segmentation
  SetWordList(hrc, hwl);

  // Adding all the strokes in this piece of ink
  while (more strokes ... )
  {
    AddStroke(hrc, NULL, 800, pPacket, pXForm);  // one call per stroke
  }
  EndInkInput(hrc);

  // This gets the ink recognized
  Process(hrc);

  // If this is a simple application, it calls this for a simple answer
  GetBestResultString(hrc, length, buffer);

  // If this is a complex application, it calls this for a complete answer
  GetLatticePtr(hrc, &amp;pLattice);

  // Destroy the context
  DestroyContext(hrc);
}
// Called just before the application shuts down
DestroyRecognizer(hrec);

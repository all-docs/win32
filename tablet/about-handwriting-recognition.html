<h1>About Handwriting Recognition</h1>
<p>Tablet PC includes technology for recognizing ink input that is most commonly in the form of handwriting. The software module that provides the recognition is called a recognizer. A recognizer recognizes one language, a group of related languages, or a class of related objects such as musical notes, system gestures, or geometric shapes. You can dynamically add recognizers to the ink services system.</p>
<h2>Recognition Steps</h2>
<p>Recognition is handled through the use of a recognizer context. Recognition consists of four basic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up the recognition constraints by:
<ul>
<li>Selecting the recognizer and input mode (geometric constraints).</li>
<li>Setting the language constraints. For example, you can restrict input to alphanumeric characters or you can pass schemas to assist the recognizer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sending ink to the recognizer.</li>
<li>Processing the input (recognizing).</li>
<li>Returning the results of the recognition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps 2 and 3 may be repeated in a loop, or all of the ink strokes may be added to the ink before recognition is attempted.</p>

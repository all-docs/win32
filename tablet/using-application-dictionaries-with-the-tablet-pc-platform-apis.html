<h1>Using Application Dictionaries with the Tablet PC Platform APIs</h1>
<p>To use an application dictionary with the Tablet PC API, you must first create a file with the list of words for your application dictionary.</p>
<p>The easiest solution for this is to use a text file that contains a list of the words. When your application loads, it reads the text file and creates a <a href="inkwordlist-class.html"><strong>WordList</strong></a> object from the list of words in the file. For each <a href="inkrecognizercontext-class.html"><strong>RecognizerContext</strong></a> associated with the application dictionary, set the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/nf-msinkaut-iinkrecognizercontext-get_wordlist"><strong>WordList</strong></a> property of the <strong>RecognizerContext</strong> object to the word list in the text file.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates how to create a <a href="inkwordlist-class.html"><strong>WordList</strong></a> object from a <a href="/dotnet/api/system.collections.specialized.stringcollection?view=netcore-3.1&amp;preserve-view=true">StringCollection</a> collection. This example assumes that you have already loaded the list of words from disk and created a StringCollection collection from these words.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>using System.Collections.Specialized;
using Microsoft.Ink;
//...
RecognizerContext theRecognizerContext;
StringCollection theUserDictionary;
//... 
// Initialize theRecognizerContext and theUserDictionary objects here.
//...
WordList theUserWordList = new WordList();
foreach (string s in theUserDictionary)
{
    theUserWordList.Add(s);
}
theRecognizerContext.WordList = theUserWordList;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/nf-msinkaut-iinkrecognizercontext-get_strokes"><strong>Strokes</strong></a> property of the <a href="inkrecognizercontext-class.html"><strong>RecognizerContext</strong></a> object must be empty before you set the <a href="inkwordlist-class.html"><strong>WordList</strong></a> property. If the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms703293(v=vs.85)"><strong>Strokes</strong></a> property is not empty, an exception is thrown. In addition, words should never be added to a word list after it has been assigned to a <strong>RecognizerContext</strong> object. Words that are added to the word list after it is assigned to the <strong>RecognizerContext</strong> object are not updated in the recognizer. To update the word list you must reassign the <strong>WordList</strong> object to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/msinkaut/nf-msinkaut-iinkrecognizercontext-get_wordlist"><strong>WordList</strong></a> property of the <strong>RecognizerContext</strong> object.</p>

<p>For maximum recognition accuracy, combine factoids with your application dictionary in an advantageous relationship.

<h1>Recognizer Stroke Reordering Support</h1>
<p>The Microsoft recognizers of Latin script support stroke reordering.</p>
<p>The Microsoft handwriting recognizers of Latin script do not depend upon the strokes in a line being written in a particular order. Instead, the recognizers order the strokes internally based upon spatial relationships between the strokes. For example, the recognizers of Latin script support the common scenario in which someone goes back on a line to write a left parenthesis, &quot;(&quot;, or to add quotation marks.</p>

<h1>Ink Recognition Sample</h1>
<p>This application demonstrates how you can build a handwriting recognition application.The Windows Vista SDK provides versions of this sample in C# and Visual Basic .NET, as well. This topic refers to the Visual Basic .NET sample, but the concepts are the same between versions.</p>
<h2>Access the Tablet PC Interfaces</h2>
<p>First, reference the Tablet PC API, which are installed with the SDK.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>' The Ink namespace, which contains the Tablet PC Platform API
Imports Microsoft.Ink
</code></pre>
<h2>Initialize the InkCollector</h2>
<p>The sample adds code to the form's <a href="/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.form.load?view=netcore-3.1&amp;preserve-view=true">Load</a> event handler that serves to associate the <a href="/previous-versions/ms583683(v=vs.100)">InkCollector</a>, myInkCollector, with the group box window and enable the InkCollector.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Private Sub InkRecognition_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load

   ' Create the recognizers collection
    myRecognizers = New Recognizers()

    ' Create an ink collector that uses the group box handle
    myInkCollector = New InkCollector(gbInkArea.Handle)

    ' Turn the ink collector on
    myInkCollector.Enabled = True

End Sub
</code></pre>
<h2>Recognize the Strokes</h2>
<p>The <a href="/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.button?view=netcore-3.1&amp;preserve-view=true">Button</a> object's <a href="/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.click?view=netcore-3.1&amp;preserve-view=true">Click</a> event handler checks to ensure that the user has at least one recognizer installed by examining the <a href="/previous-versions/ms828521(v=msdn.10)">Count</a> property of the <a href="/previous-versions/ms828520(v=msdn.10)">Recognizers</a> collection.</p>
<p>The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/">SelectedText</a> property of the text box is set to the best match for the strokes using the <a href="/previous-versions/ms827836(v=msdn.10)">ToString</a> method on the <a href="/previous-versions/ms552701(v=vs.100)">Strokes</a> collection. After the strokes have been recognized, they are deleted. Finally, the code forces drawing area repaint, clearing it for further ink use.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Private Sub btnRecognize_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnRecognize.Click

    ' Check to ensure that the user has at least one recognizer installed
    ' Note that this is a preventive check - otherwise, an exception 
    ' occurs during recognition
    If 0 = myRecognizers.Count Then
        MessageBox.Show(&quot;There are no handwriting recognizers installed.  You need to have at least one in order to run this sample.&quot;)
    Else
        ' ...
        txtResults.SelectedText = myInkCollector.Ink.Strokes.ToString

        ' If the mouse is pressed, do not perform the recognition -
        ' this prevents deleting a stroke that is still being drawn
        If Not myInkCollector.CollectingInk Then

            ' Delete the ink from the ink collector
            myInkCollector.Ink.DeleteStrokes(myInkCollector.Ink.Strokes)

            ' Force the Frame to redraw (so the deleted ink goes away)
            gbInkArea.Refresh()

        End If
    End If
End Sub
</code></pre>
<h2>Closing the Form</h2>
<p>The form's <a href="/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.form.dispose?view=netcore-3.1&amp;preserve-view=true">Dispose</a> method disposes the <a href="/previous-versions/ms583683(v=vs.100)">InkCollector</a> object.</p>

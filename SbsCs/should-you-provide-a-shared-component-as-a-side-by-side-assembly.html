<h1>Should you provide a shared component as a side-by-side assembly?</h1>
<p>Providers of shared components should consider making their component available as a side-by-side assembly if one or more of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The component exposes a rich application programming interface that is used by many applications. For example, a component such as MSHTML, which enables C and C++ applications to access the Dynamic HTML (DHTML) Object Model.</li>
<li>The component is already being shared by multiple applications. For example, a component such as COMCTL32, which provides applications access to the common controls.</li>
<li>The component is a new component.</li>
<li>The component is a user-mode component and not a device driver.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every component is a suitable candidate for a side-by-side assembly. A component is not a suitable candidate for a side-by-side assembly if any of the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The component handles communication between applications. For example, parts of OLE32 would not make a good side-by-side assembly because you would not want to have two different versions of the parts that coordinate communication between applications run on your system.</li>
<li>The component manages a physical or virtual device for the system. For example a device driver for a print spooler.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases it may be possible for the developer of the component to redesign an existing component in order to make it suitable for publication as a side-by-side assembly.

<h1>Enabling an Assembly in an Application Hosting a DLL, Extension, or Control Panel</h1>
<p>If your application hosts a third-party DLL, extension, plug-in, or control panel, you may want to enable an assembly in your applicationâ€”without also enabling this assembly for the hosted components. This can be the case when a hosted component requires code changes to use the assembly. As the application developer, you may be unable to make changes to these third-party components. In this case, you should follow the procedure described in this section so that your application can use the assembly without affecting the hosted components.</p>
<ul>
<li>To enable an assembly in an application without affecting any hosted DLLs, extensions, plug-ins, or control panels, a manifest that describes the application's dependence on the assembly should be included in the application as a resource. The hosted components that are not being enabled with the assembly should not include manifests describing this dependency.</li>
<li>To enable an assembly in an application and its hosted DLLs, extensions, plug-ins, or control panels, include manifests as resources in both the application and its hosted components. The manifests included in the application and in the hosted components should each describe a dependence on the assembly. Typically, the application developer adds a manifest to the application and the hosted component developer adds a manifest to the DLL, extension, plug-in, or control panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following method can be used to add a manifest to an application or a hosted component that is a DLL, extension, plug-in, or control panel.</p>
<p><strong>To enable an assembly in an application or hosted component.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Author a manifest that describes the dependence of the application or extension on the assembly.</p>
<p>For example, the manifest for &quot;YourApplication&quot; can be created by copying the following sample manifest and substituting correct values for <strong>assemblyIdentity</strong>, <strong>processorArchitecture</strong>, and <strong>description</strong>. Set the value of <strong>processorArchitecture</strong> to x86 if building on a 32-bit platform and to ia64 if building on a 64-bit platform. The <strong>description</strong> element contains an option description of the application. For more information about the manifest format, see <a href="application-manifests.html">application manifests</a>.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot;?&gt;
&lt;assembly xmlns=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1&quot; manifestVersion=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;assemblyIdentity
    version=&quot;1.0.0.0&quot;
    processorArchitecture=&quot;x86&quot;
    name=&quot;YourCompanyName.YourDivision.YourApp&quot;
    type=&quot;win32&quot;
/&gt;
&lt;description&gt;Your app description here&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;dependentAssembly&gt;
        &lt;assemblyIdentity
            type=&quot;win32&quot;
            name=&quot;Proseware.Research.SampleAssembly&quot;
            version=&quot;6.0.0.0&quot;
            processorArchitecture=&quot;X86&quot;
            publicKeyToken=&quot;0000000000000000&quot;
            language=&quot;*&quot;
        /&gt;
    &lt;/dependentAssembly&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/assembly&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a resource in the application or extension of type RT_MANIFEST id 2.</p>
<p>For example, if the application's name is YourApp, the application should contain the following:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#define MANIFEST_RESOURCE_ID 2
MANIFEST_RESOURCE_ID RT_MANIFEST &quot;YourApp.manifest&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compile the application with the -DISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED flag, or insert this statement before the #include &quot;Windows.h&quot; statement. In the case of an application with multiple modules, the -DISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED flag is required on all modules.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#define ISOLATION_AWARE_ENABLED 1
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test to ensure that assemblies that are used by the application work correctly in the application and hosted component.</p>
</li>
</ol>

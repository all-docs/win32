<h1>Creating Signed Files and Catalogs</h1>
<p>To sign a file and create a catalog for it, you must first have a process for signing files, a certificate, and a public key.</p>
<p><strong>To sign a file and a create a catalog</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="pktextract-exe.html">Pktextract.exe</a> to extract the <a href="p-sbscs-gly.html"><em>public key token</em></a> from the certificate file. The certificate file must be present in the same directory as the utility.</li>
<li>Use the public key token value to update the <strong>publicKeyToken</strong> attribute of the <strong>assemblyIdentity</strong> element in the manifest file.</li>
<li>Use <a href="mt-exe.html">MT.exe</a> to generate hashes of files contained in the assembly manifest and to create the catalog description file (.cdf).</li>
<li>Use Makecat.exe with the generated .cdf to create the security catalog for the assembly. This tool is included in the CryptoAPI.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/signtool">SignTool</a> utility to sign the catalog generated with the certificate used in step 1. The .cdf from steps 3 and 4 can be deleted once the catalog is created.</li>
</ol>

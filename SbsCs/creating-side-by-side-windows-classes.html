<h1>Creating Side-By-Side Windows Classes</h1>
<p>Application contexts can be used to create side-by-side Windows classes. By using side-by-side Windows classes, your application can have different versions of a class active at the same time in a lone parent window. To create a side-by-side Windows class, your application must activate an activation context before calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowa"><strong>CreateWindow</strong></a> to obtain a handle to the new window.</p>
<p>For example, Windows Common Controls version 5.82 and version 6.0 both had an Edit control. Windows defaults to using the version 5.82 Edit control. To obtain a side-by-side window that has the version 6.0 Edit control, before calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowa"><strong>CreateWindow</strong></a> as usual, your application can reference an assembly that exposes named window classes and then activate the activation context that references the version 6.0 controls.</p>

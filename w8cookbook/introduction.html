<h1>Introduction (Compatibility cookbook for Windows)</h1>
<p>WindowsÂ 10, WindowsÂ 8, WindowsÂ 8.1, and Windows ServerÂ 2012Â R2 introduce the latest operating system technology and software development platforms for use by app developers and enterprises worldwide. As part of further enhancing the security, reliability, performance, and user experience of Windows, Microsoft has introduced many new features, improved existing features, and removed others.</p>
<p>While the goal of WindowsÂ 10, WindowsÂ 8, WindowsÂ 8.1, and Windows ServerÂ 2012Â R2 is to stay highly compatible with most of their respective apps written for previously released operating systems, some compatibility breaks are inevitable due to innovations, tightened security, and increased reliability. Overall, the compatibility of the new operating systems with existing apps is high.</p>
<p>This <em>Cookbook</em> is divided into three major sections, Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>WindowsÂ 10</li>
<li>WindowsÂ 8.1 and Windows ServerÂ 2012Â R2</li>
<li>WindowsÂ 8 and Windows ServerÂ 2012</li>
</ul>
<p>The following topics are either new with this release of the <em>Cookbook</em> or have been updated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Image File Boot (WimBoot)</li>
<li>Windows App Certification Kit</li>
</ul>
<p>We invite you to check out these topics to learn how to optimize your apps and take advantage of what this newest release of Windows has to offer.</p>

<h1>Enhanced storage is now optional for WINPE and server SKU</h1>
<h2>Platforms</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> â€“ WindowsÂ 8<br />
<strong>Servers</strong> â€“ Windows ServerÂ 2012</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Enhanced storage was always available in WindowsÂ 7 USB devices. With the release of WindowsÂ 8, it is available for all storage devices. In client-based devices, it is enabled by default; in server devices it is optional and must be provisioned through Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE).</p>
<h2>Manifestation</h2>
<p>The server device will fail if enhanced storage is not enabled.</p>
<p>Boot devices must be provisioned through WinPE with this enabled.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Because enhanced storage is optional for runtime server, developers must add it to WinPE for provisioning and activation of those drives. See the deployment guide for details.</p>
<p>Server administrators must then explicitly configure their server to use enhanced storage.</p>

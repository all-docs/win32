<h1>Startup apps</h1>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong>   Windows 8</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One of the big bets with Windows is the ability to light up various form factors, from the traditional desktops and laptops to low-powered tablets. To ensure that our mutual customers have a great experience on any form factor they choose with Windows, two key success metrics that need to be addressed are increased battery life and excellent PC responsiveness. In order to achieve these, improvements have been made in multiple areas of Windows including process life cycle, sleep states and startup apps (apps with automated launch after machine boot). This topic highlights some of the impacts that startup apps have on a Windows device, and provides guidance to developers (ISV/IHV) and OEMs to rethink the usage patterns of startup apps in order to improve battery life and responsiveness for our mutual customers. It also describes the changes in Windows that put users in control of determining which of the startup apps actually get to execute.</p>
<p>Windows Store apps are designed to adhere to new standards of battery consumption and responsiveness, and Windows manages their life cycle by suspending and/or terminating them. However, desktop apps designed for prior Windows versions have not necessarily been designed to preserve battery life or be sensitive to user activity, and can affect system responsiveness (for example, when an app sends a regular 1-second heartbeat to check for updates, or pre-allocates memory upfront in case it needs it later). This can create a poor experience for the user who buys a Windows tablet PC with a long battery life expectancy and weeks of standby, but discovers the tablet s battery life does not achieve these goals. Also, since startup apps run in the background, the number of apps running on the system can be significantly more than what the user is aware of and affect system responsiveness. Startup apps are classified to include those leveraging these mechanisms to start:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run registry keys (HKLM, HKCU, wow64 nodes included)</li>
<li>RunOnce registry keys</li>
<li>Startup folders under the start menu for per user and public locations</li>
</ul>
<p>New functionality has been added to Windows to ensure that end users are always in control of the apps that run on their systems. The Startup tab in Task Manager shows a list of startup apps, along with controls that allow users to disable startup apps. To help users determine what to disable, Task Manager displays a measure of each startup app s impact. Impact is assessed based on an app s CPU and disk usage at startup. Impact values are determined by applying these criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High impact</strong>   Apps that use more than 1 second of CPU time or more than 3 MB of disk I/O at startup</li>
<li><strong>Medium impact</strong>   Apps that use 300 ms - 1000 ms of CPU time or 300 KB - 3 MB of disk I/O</li>
<li><strong>Low impact</strong>   Apps that use less than 300 ms of CPU time and less than 300 KB of disk I/O</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft provides tools to help app developers assess, analyze and take steps to reduce their startup impact and improve the user experience. The Assessment and Deployment Kit provides the ability to run a boot performance assessment and measure the impact of apps that run at startup. The assessment results contain detailed analysis and remediation info where applicable, for the top-impacting components at Windows startup. Using the Windows Performance Analyzer, app developers can perform deep analysis to find the root cause of the performance impact and improve Windows startup performance.

<h2>Guidance</h2>
<p>Startup apps span multiple categories as described in the table below. A set of recommendations for developers is mapped to the categories of startup apps to align with the Windows functional changes described above.</p>

<p>Monitor and update users for online updates</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance Task</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
All updates should be maintenance tasks, without any UI interaction requirements. Apps should just update themselves quietly, and rollback on failure</p>

<p><strong>Windows Store apps</strong></p>
<p>Windows Store apps enhance the user experience by introducing a Windows space with new coordinates: a new app model, a new user interface, and a Windows Store. These language and presentation framework options are available for developing Windows Store apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML/JavaScript/CSS</li>
<li>XAML/C#</li>
<li>XAML/C++</li>
</ul>
<p>Aggregated info for developing Windows Store apps is available at the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/">Windows Dev Center</a>.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh452744(v=win.10)">Developing Windows Store games</a></li>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/apps/hh465132(v=win.10)">Developing Windows Store app that use Media</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automatic maintenance tasks</strong></p>
<p>Periodic background activity should be designed as Automatic Maintenance tasks. These are scheduled at system idle time to increase the responsiveness and energy efficiency of Windows PCs. Maintenance tasks can be created and configured by a desktop app at install time, using the desktop SDK. See the Automatic Maintenance topic that follows for details.</p>

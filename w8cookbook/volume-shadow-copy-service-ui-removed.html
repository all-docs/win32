<h1>Previous versions UI removed for local volumes</h1>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> â€“ WindowsÂ 8</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of Windows allowed users to restore previous versions of individual files from â€œshadow copiesâ€ of local volumes. These shadow copies are created by the â€œPrevious Versionsâ€ feature through Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS). In Windows 7, users could configure and schedule shadow copies in System Protection UI available through System Properties.</p>
<p>However, Previous Versions were rarely used and negatively impacted the overall Windows performance; as a result the feature was removed. In WindowsÂ 8, these features are no longer available:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to browse, search or restore previous versions of files through Previous Versions UI</li>
<li>The ability to configure or schedule previous versions of files through System Protection UI</li>
</ul>
<p>However, users can still use the Previous Versions tab when accessing file shares on a Windows server.</p>
<h2>Manifestation</h2>
<p>The Previous Versions option is no longer available for local volumes in the Windows Explorer Properties menu.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Developers who need to create shadow copies of local volumes can still do so by calling VSS APIs in custom code.</p>

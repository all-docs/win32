<h1>Windows Assessment Toolkit</h1>
<h2>Platforms</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> - Windows 7 | Windows 8</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Windows Assessment Toolkit and the Windows Performance Toolkit make up the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK). Together they provide a complete solution for evaluating overall computer performance and automating the deployment of the Windows operating system to new computers.</p>
<p>This topic focuses on the <strong>Assessment Toolkit</strong>. The assessment results are used to diagnose potential problems, so that the hardware and software that you develop are both responsive and have a minimal impact on battery life, startup performance, and shutdown time. The same assessments are available for OEM partners, ISV/IHV partners, enthusiasts, and other members of the community, to establish a common framework to measure, compare, and review aspects of quality.</p>
<p>By using the Windows assessment tools, you can measure different aspects of performance across a variety of scenarios, from boot time to battery-life performance to high-definition video streaming. Assessments can identify potential issues, inconsistent behavior, and highlight areas to investigate.</p>
<p>In previous Windows releases, multiple tools were available to measure quality, including Velocity Test Suite (VTS/VOS), Fundamental Quality Tools Suite (FQTS), and System Power and Performance Tools Suite (SPPTS). The Assessment Toolkit combines the functionality from these performance-diagnostic tools into an integrated set of tools that is easier to use and provides broader, more meaningful results.</p>
<p>The Windows Assessment Toolkit maximizes consumer satisfaction by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping you to assess the overall experience of Windows, value-added software and drivers, and hardware configurations</li>
<li>Providing detailed system data that can help you identify the root causes of quality issues</li>
<li>Reducing your costs by revealing issues during development</li>
<li>Generating comparisons of results from different computers or the same set of computers over time by creating comparison graphs from multiple result sets</li>
<li>Generating feedback in a standardized format that you can use to improve the quality of your products</li>
</ul>
<p>Important business objectives can be achieved by using the Assessments Toolkit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measure &amp; compare</strong> - You can use the data to compare components (software, drivers, or both) against other similar components to facilitate your decision making, recommendations, and competitive bench marking</li>
<li><strong>Improve quality</strong> - You can work independently or with involved partners to build a component (software, driver, or both) as per pre-defined quality criteria</li>
<li><strong>Track quality</strong>   You can create a process for efficiently tracking quality of component versions and detect regressions after each iteration</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage and best practices</h2>
<p>Assessments are a combination of XML and binary files that induce a specific set of states on a computer, measure and record the activity, and preserve the recorded results. A job is a collection of one or more assessments and their settings, run at one time on a computer. The Assessment Platform provides the infrastructure for consistently running and displaying jobs, assessments, and results. The results often include diagnostics and remediation info that helps you determine areas that need additional investigation and corrective action. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run assessments against a single computer or a small collection of computers with the <strong>Windows Assessment Console</strong> (Windows AC) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> This scenario is for users who want to view performance characteristics on one or several different computer configurations. Windows AC is a graphical user interface (GUI) that is used to group the assessments, create a job, package a job, run the job, and manage the job results. Results often include recommended actions.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
<li>Run assessments against multiple computers in a lab environment with <strong>Windows Assessment Services</strong> (Windows AS) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> This scenario is primarily for users who want to run a suite of qualitative assessments against a complete line of desktops, laptops, or tablet computers in a development environment.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Assessment Toolkit offers these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A simple graphical user interface (GUI) and assessments that can be used to assess a computer without any in-depth technical knowledge of the system</li>
<li>Assessment results, viewed in the console or UI, which often include recommendations to help you improve the system</li>
<li>The ability to run a preconfigured job with one click</li>
<li>Predefined assessment settings in each preconfigured job assessment so that you can run a job on multiple computers and be confident that the results are comparable</li>
<li>Jobs that can be customized to include the assessments you want to use and the settings you want to use</li>
<li>Assessment Platform command-line syntax for scripting and automating jobs</li>
<li>The ability to run a job, view the results, take remediation steps to improve the system, and then run the job again and compare the new results side-by-side with the old results to see the how the system has improved</li>
</ul>
<p>The Assessment Toolkit is typically used in these scenarios:</p>

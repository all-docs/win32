<h1>List Boxes</h1>

<p>[!NOTE]
This design guide was created for Windows 7 and has not been updated for newer versions of Windows. Much of the guidance still applies in principle, but the presentation and examples do not reflect our <a href="/windows/uwp/design/">current design guidance</a>.</p>

<p>With a list box, users can select from a set of values presented in a list that is always visible. With a single-selection list box, users select one item from a list of mutually exclusive values. With a multiple-selection list box, users select zero or more items from a list of values.</p>

Guidelines related to <a href="vis-layout.html">layout</a> and <a href="ctrl-list-views.html">list views</a> are presented in separate articles.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Is this the right control?</h2>
<p>To decide, consider these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does the list present data, rather than program options?</strong> Either way, a list box is a suitable choice regardless of the number of items. By contrast, <a href="ctrl-radio-buttons.html">radio buttons</a> or <a href="ctrl-check-boxes.html">check boxes</a> are suitable only for a small number of program options.</li>
<li><strong>Do users need to change views, group, sort by columns, or change column widths and order?</strong> If so, use a <a href="ctrl-list-views.html">list view</a> instead.</li>
<li><strong>Does the control need to be a drag source or a drop target?</strong> If so, use a list view instead.</li>
<li><strong>Do the list items need to be copied to or pasted from the clipboard?</strong> If so, use a list view instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Single-selection lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the control used to choose one option from a list of mutually exclusive values?</strong> If not, use another control. To choose multiple options, use a standard multiple-selection list, check box list, list builder, or add/remove list instead.</li>
<li><strong>Is there a default option that is recommended for most users in most situations?</strong> Is seeing the selected option far more important than seeing the alternatives? If so, consider using a <a href="/windows/desktop/uxguide/ctrl-drop">drop-down list</a> if you don't want to encourage users to make changes by hiding the alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image2.png" alt="screen shot of highest quality as default button " /></p>
<p>In this example, the highest color quality is the best choice for most users, so a drop-down list is a good choice to downplay the alternatives.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does the list require constant interaction?</strong> If so, use a single-selection list to simplify the interaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image3.png" alt="screen shot of list of options such as plain text " /></p>
<p>In this example, users are constantly changing the selected item in the Display items list to set the foreground and background colors. Using a drop-down list in this case would be very tedious.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Does the setting seem like a relative quantity?Would users benefit from instant feedback</strong> on the effect of setting changes? If so, consider using a <a href="ctrl-sliders.html">slider</a> instead.</li>
<li><strong>Is there a significant hierarchical relationship between the list items?</strong> If so, use a <a href="ctrl-tree-views.html">tree view</a> control instead.</li>
<li><strong>Is screen space at a premium?</strong> If so, use a drop-down list instead because the screen space used is fixed and independent of the number of list items.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standard multiple-selection lists and check box lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is multiple selection essential to the task or commonly used?</strong> If so, use a check box list to make multiple selection obvious, especially if your target users aren't advanced. Many users won't realize that a standard multiple-selection list supports multiple selection. Use a standard multiple-selection list if the check boxes would draw too much attention to multiple selection or result in too much screen clutter.</li>
<li><strong>Is the stability of the multiple selection important?</strong> If so, use a check box list, list builder, or add/remove list because clicking changes only a single item at a time. With a standard multiple selection list, it's very easy to clear all the selections even by accident.</li>
<li><strong>Is the control used to choose zero or more items from a list of values?</strong> If not, use another control. For choosing one item, use a single-selection list instead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preview lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are the options easier to select with images than with text alone?</strong> If so, use a preview list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>List builders and add/remove lists</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the control used to choose zero or more items from a list of values?</strong> If not, use another control. For choosing one item, use a single-selection list instead.</li>
<li><strong>Does the order of the selected items matter?</strong> If so, the list builder and add/remove list patterns support order, whereas the other multiple-selection patterns do not.</li>
<li><strong>Is it important for users to see a summary of all the selected items?</strong> If so, the list builder and add/remove list patterns display only the selected items, whereas the other multiple-selection patterns do not.</li>
<li><strong>Are the possible choices unconstrained?</strong> If so, use an add/remove list so that users can choose values not currently in the list.</li>
<li><strong>Does adding a value to the list require a specialized dialog box for choosing objects?</strong> If so, use an add/remove list and display the dialog box when users click Add.</li>
<li><strong>Is screen space at a premium?</strong> If so, use an add/remove list instead because it uses less screen space by not always showing the set of options.</li>
</ul>
<p>For list boxes, <strong>the number of items in the list isn't a factor in choosing the control</strong> because they scale from thousands of items all the way down to one for single-selection lists (and none for multiple-selection lists). Because list boxes can be used for data, the number of items might not be known in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Sometimes a control that looks like a list box is implemented using a list view and vice versa. In such cases, apply the guidelines based on usage, not implementation.</p>
<h2>Usage patterns</h2>
<p>List boxes have several usage patterns:</p>
<table>

<td>Standard multiple-selection lists have exactly the same appearance as single-selection lists, so there is no visual clue that a list box supports multiple selection.

In the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->multiple-selection mode<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, clicking any item toggles its selection state regardless of the Shift and Ctrl keys. Given this unusual behavior, multiple-selection mode is deprecated and you should use check box lists instead.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> In this example, users can select any number of items using the multiple-selection mode.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Check box lists<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Like standard multiple-selection list boxes, check box lists allow users to select any number of items, including none.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<td>A list builder consists of two single-selection lists: the list on the left is a fixed set of options and the list on the right is the list being built.

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<h3>Presentation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sort list items in a logical order,</strong> such as grouping related options together, placing most frequently used items first, or using alphabetical order. Sort names in alphabetical order, numbers in numeric order, and dates in chronological order. Lists with 12 or more items should be sorted alphabetically to make items easier to find.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image10.png" alt="screen shot of alignment (left, center, right) " /></p>
<p>In this example, the list box items are sorted by their spatial relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image11.png" alt="screen shot of disorganized list " /></p>
<p>In this example, there are so many list items that they should be sorted in alphabetical order.</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image12.png" alt="screen shot of alphabetized list " /></p>
<p>In this example, the list items are easier to find because they are sorted in alphabetical order. However, the item &quot;All Windows products&quot; is at the beginning of the list, regardless of its sort order.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Place options that represent All or None at the beginning of the list</strong>, regardless of sort order of the remaining items.</li>
<li><strong>Enclose meta-options in parentheses.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image13.png" alt="screen shot of drop-down list with none selected " /></p>
<p>In this example, &quot;(none)&quot; is a meta-option because it is not a valid value for the choice rather it indicates that the option itself isn't being used.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't have blank list items use meta-options instead.</strong> Users don't know how to interpret blank items, whereas the meaning of meta-options is explicit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image14.png" alt="screen shot of drop-down list with blank selected " /></p>
<p>In this example, the meaning of the blank item is unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image13.png" alt="screen shot of drop-down list with none selected " /></p>
<p>In this example, the &quot;(none)&quot; meta-option is used instead.</p>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider providing double-click behavior.</strong> Double-clicking should have the same effect as selecting an item and performing its default command.</li>
<li><strong>Make double-click behavior redundant.</strong> There should always be a command button or context menu command that has the same effect.</li>
<li><strong>If users can't do anything with the selected items, don't allow selection.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image15.png" alt="screen shot of list of wizard changes completed " /></p>
<p>This list box displays a read-only list of changes; there is no need for selection.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When disabling a list box, also disable any associated labels and command buttons.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Don't use the change of the selected item in a list box to:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perform commands.</li>
<li>Display other windows, such as a dialog box to gather more input.</li>
<li>Dynamically display other controls related to the selected control (screen readers cannot detect such events). <strong>Exception:</strong> You can dynamically change static text used to describe the selected item.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acceptable:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image16.png" alt="screen shot of details of list item selected " /></p>
<p>In this example, changing the selected item changes the description.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid horizontal scrolling.</strong> Multicolumn lists rely on horizontal scrolling, which is generally harder to use than vertical scrolling. Multicolumn lists that require horizontal scrolling may be used when you have many alphabetically sorted items and sufficient screen space for a wide control.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acceptable:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image17.png" alt="screen shot of list of folders in windows explorer " /></p>
<p>In this example, multiple columns that require horizontal scrolling are used because there are many items and plenty of available screen space for a wide control.</p>
<h3>Multiple-selection lists</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consider displaying the number of selected items below the list,</strong> especially if users are likely to select several items. This information not only gives useful feedback, but it also clearly indicates that the list box supports multiple selection.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image5.png" alt="screen shot of list box with four items selected " /></p>
<p>In this example, the number of selected items is displayed below the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can provide other selection metrics that might be more meaningful, such as the resources required for the selections.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image18.png" alt="screen shot of check-box list of windows features " /></p>
<p>In this example, the disk space required to install the components is more meaningful than the number of items selected.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are potentially many list items and selecting or clearing all of them is likely, add Select all and Clear all command buttons.</li>
<li>For standard multiple-selection lists, don't use multiple-selection mode because this selection mode has been deprecated. For equivalent behavior, use a check box list instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Default values</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Select the safest (to prevent loss of data or system access) and most secure option by default.</strong> If safety and security aren't factors, select the most likely or convenient option.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Don't select any items if the control represents a property in a <a href="glossary.html">mixed state</a>, which happens when displaying a property for multiple objects that don't have the same setting.</p>
<h2>Recommended sizing and spacing</h2>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image19.png" alt="screen shot of list-box sizing and spacing " /></p>
<p>Recommended sizing and spacing for list boxes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose a list box width appropriate for the longest valid data.</strong> Standard list boxes cannot be scrolled horizontally, so users can see only what is visible in the control.</li>
<li><strong>Include an additional 30 percent</strong> (up to 200 percent for shorter text) for any text (but not numbers) that will be localized.</li>
<li><strong>Choose a list box height that displays an integral number of items.</strong> Avoid truncating items vertically.</li>
<li><strong>Choose a list box height that eliminates unnecessary vertical scrolling.</strong> List boxes should display between 3 and 20 items without the need for scrolling. Consider making a list box slightly longer if doing so eliminates the vertical scroll bar. Lists with potentially many items should display at least five items to facilitate scrolling by showing more items at a time and making the scroll bar easier to position.</li>
<li><strong>If users benefit from making the list box larger, make the list box and its parent window resizable.</strong> Doing so allows users to adjust the list box size as needed. However, resizable list boxes should display no fewer than three items.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Labels</h2>
<p><strong>Control labels</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All list boxes need labels. Write the label as a word or phrase, not as a sentence; use a colon at the end of the label.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Omit the label if it is merely a restatement of a dialog box's <a href="glossary.html">main instruction</a>. In this case, the main instruction takes the colon (unless it's a question) and access key.</p>
<p><strong>Acceptable:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image20.png" alt="screen shot of list with redundant label " /></p>
<p>In this example, the list box label just restates the main instruction.</p>
<p><strong>Better:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image21.png" alt="screen shot of list of without redundant label " /></p>
<p>In this example, the redundant label is removed, so the main instruction takes the colon and access key.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a list box is subordinate to a radio button or check box and is introduced by that control's label ending with a colon, don't put an additional label on the list box control.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image22.png" alt="screen shot of button and list using same label " /></p>
<p>In this example, the list box is subordinate to a radio button and shares its label.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a unique <a href="glossary.html">access key</a>. For guidelines, see <a href="inter-keyboard.html">Keyboard</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="glossary.html">sentence-style capitalization</a>.</li>
<li>Position the label either to the left of or above the control, and align the label with the left edge of the control.
<ul>
<li>If label is on the left, vertically align the label text with the first line of text in the control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image23.png" alt="screen shot of list with left-aligned label above " /><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image24.png" alt="screen shot of list with text-aligned label to left " /></p>
<p>In these examples, the label on top aligns with the left edge of the list box and the label on the left aligns with the text in the list box.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image25.png" alt="screen shot of list with text-aligned label above " /><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image26.png" alt="screen shot of list with top-aligned label on left " /></p>
<p>In these incorrect examples, the label on top aligns with the text in the list box and the label on the left aligns with the top of the list box.</p>
<ul>
<li>For multiple-selection list boxes, use a label that clearly indicates multiple selection is possible. Check box list labels can be less explicit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Correct:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image27.png" alt="screen shot of list with select one or more label " /></p>
<p>In this example, the label clearly indicates that multiple selection is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image28.png" alt="screen shot of list box with add-ons label " /></p>
<p>In this example, the label provides no obvious information about multiple selection.</p>
<p><strong>Best:</strong> <img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image29.png" alt="screen shot of check-box list with add-ons label " /></p>
<p>In this example, the check boxes clearly indicate that multiple selection is possible, so the label doesn't have to be explicit.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may specify units (seconds, connections, and so on) in parentheses after the label.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Option text</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Assign a unique name to each option.</li>
<li>Use <a href="glossary.html">sentence-style capitalization</a>, unless an item is a proper noun.</li>
<li>Write the label as a word or phrase, not as a sentence, and use no ending punctuation.</li>
<li>Use parallel phrasing, and try to keep the length about the same for all options.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Instructional and supplemental text</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you need to add instructional text about a list box, add it above the label. Use complete sentences with ending punctuation.</li>
<li>Use <a href="glossary.html">sentence-style capitalization</a>.</li>
<li>Additional information that is helpful but not necessary should be kept short. Place this text either in parentheses between the label and colon, or without parentheses below the control.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/ctrl-list-boxes-image30.png" alt="screen shot of check-box list and descriptive text " /></p>
<p>In this example, supplemental text is placed below the list.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>When referring to list boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the exact label text, including its capitalization, but don't include the access key underscore or colon. Include the word list. Don't refer to a list box as a list box or a field.</li>
<li>For list items, use the exact item text, including its capitalization.</li>
<li>In programming and other technical documentation, refer to list boxes as list boxes. Everywhere else, use list.</li>
<li>To describe user interaction, use select.</li>
<li>When possible, format the label and list items using bold text. Otherwise, put the label and items in quotation marks only if required to prevent confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: In the <strong>Go to what</strong> list, select <strong>Bookmark</strong>.</p>

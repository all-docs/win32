<td><a href="winenv-desktop.html">Desktop</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The desktop is the user's work area for their programs. It's not a way to promote awareness of your program or its brand. Don't abuse it! <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="winenv-taskbar.html">Taskbar</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The taskbar is the access point for programs displayed on the desktop. With the new Windows 7 taskbar features, users can give commands, access resources, and view program status directly from the taskbar. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="winenv-notification.html">Notification Area</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The notification area provides notifications and status. Well-designed programs use the notification area appropriately, without being annoying or distracting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="winenv-ctrl-panels.html">Control Panels</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Use control panel items to help users configure system-level features and perform related tasks. Programs that have a user interface should be configured directly from their UI instead. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="winenv-help.html">Help</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Use Help as a secondary mechanism to help users complete and better understand tasks the primary mechanism being the UI itself. Apply these guidelines to make the content truly helpful and easy to find. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<tr>
<td><a href="winenv-uac.html">User Account Control</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A well designed User Account Control experience helps prevent unwanted system-wide changes in a way that is predictable and requires minimal effort. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

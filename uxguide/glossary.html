<h1>Glossary (Design basics)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
This design guide was created for Windows 7 and has not been updated for newer versions of Windows. Much of the guidance still applies in principle, but the presentation and examples do not reflect our <a href="/windows/uwp/design/">current design guidance</a>.</p>

<h2><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A<!-- raw HTML omitted --></h2>
<p><strong>About box</strong></p>
<p>A dialog box providing general program information, such as version identification, copyright, licensing agreements, and ways to access technical support.</p>
<p><strong>above the fold</strong></p>
<p>A screen layout metaphor taken from newspaper journalism. The content above the fold of the newspaper must be particularly engaging to spur sales. Similarly, in screen layout, the most important content must be visible without scrolling. Users must be motivated to take the time to scroll past the content they encounter initially &quot;above the fold.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>access key</strong></p>
<p>An alphanumeric key that, when combined with the Alt key, activates a control. Access keys are indicated by underlining one of the characters in the control's label. For example, pressing Alt+O activates a control whose label is &quot;Open&quot; and whose assigned access key is &quot;O&quot;. Access keys aren't case sensitive. The effect of activating a control depends on the type of control.</p>
<p>In contrast to shortcut keys, which are intended mostly for advanced users, access keys are designed to improve accessibility. Because they are documented directly within the user interface (UI) itself, they can't always be assigned consistently and they aren't intended to be memorized.</p>
<p><strong>active monitor</strong></p>
<p>The monitor where the active program is running.</p>
<p><strong>address bar</strong></p>
<p>A navigational element, usually appearing at the top of a window, that displays, and allows users to change, their current location. See also: <a href="#b">breadcrumb bar</a>.</p>

<p>A program used to perform a related set of user tasks; often relatively complex and sophisticated. See also: <a href="#p">program</a>.</p>
<p><strong>application key</strong></p>
<p>A keyboard key with a context menu graphic on it. This key is used to display the context menu for the selected item.</p>
<p><strong>application menu</strong></p>
<p>A control that presents a menu of commands that involve doing something to or with a document or workspace, such as file-related commands.</p>
<p>Displays the context menu for the current selection (the same as pressing Shift+F10).</p>
<p><strong>application theming</strong></p>
<p>Using related visual techniques, such as customized controls, to create a unique look or branding for an application.</p>
<p><strong>aspect ratio</strong></p>
<p>An expression of the relation between the width of an object and its height. For example, high definition television uses a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>auto-complete</strong></p>
<p>A type of list used in text boxes and editable drop-down lists in which the likely input can be extrapolated and populated automatically from having been entered previously. Users type a minimal amount of text to populate the auto-complete list.</p>
<p><strong>auto-exit</strong></p>
<p>A text box in which the input focus automatically moves to the next related text box as soon as a user types the last character.</p>
<h2>B</h2>
<p><strong>balloon</strong></p>
<p>A common Windows control that informs users of a non-critical problem or special condition.</p>
<p><strong>breadcrumb bar</strong></p>
<p>A navigational element, usually appearing at the top of a window, that displays, and allows users to change, their current location. &quot;Breadcrumb&quot; refers to breaking the current location into a series of links separated by arrows that users can interact with directly. Use address bar instead. See also: <a href="#alink">address bar</a>.</p>
<h2>C</h2>
<p><strong>check box</strong></p>
<p>A common Windows control that allows users to decide between clearly differing choices, such as toggling an option on or off.</p>

<p>A wizard page used to indicate the end of a wizard. Sometimes used instead of Congratulations pages. See also: congratulations page.</p>
<p><strong>congratulations page</strong></p>
<p>A wizard page used to indicate the end of a wizard. These pages are no longer recommended. Wizards conclude more efficiently with a commit page or, if necessary, a follow-up or completion page. See also: commit page, completion page, <a href="#f">follow-up page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Consent UI</strong></p>
<p>A dialog box used by User Account Control (UAC) that allows protected administrators to elevate their privileges temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>constraint</strong></p>
<p>In controls that involve user input, such as text boxes, input constraints are a valuable way to prevent errors. For example, if the only valid input for a particular control is numeric, the control can use appropriate value constraints to enforce this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>content area</strong></p>
<p>The portion of UI surfaces, such as dialog boxes, control panel items, and wizards, devoted to presenting options, providing information, and describing controls. Distinguished from the command area, task pane, and navigation area.</p>

<p><strong>custom icon</strong></p>
<p>A pictorial representation unique to a program (as opposed to a Windows system icon).</p>
<p><strong>custom visuals</strong></p>
<p>Graphics, animations, icons, and other visual elements specially developed for a program.</p>
<h2>D</h2>
<p><strong>default command button or link</strong></p>
<p>The command button or link that is invoked when users press the Enter key. The default command button or link is assigned by the developer, but any command button or link becomes the default when users tab to it.</p>
<p><strong>default monitor</strong></p>
<p>The monitor with the Start menu, taskbar, and notification area.</p>
<p><strong>delayed commit model</strong></p>
<p>The commit model used by control panel item spoke pages where changes aren't made until explicitly committed by users clicking a commit button. Thus, users can abandon a task, navigating away using the Back button, Close, or the Address bar. See also: <a href="#i">immediate commit model</a>.</p>
<p><strong>desktop</strong></p>

<p>See also: <a href="#r">relative pixels</a>, <a href="#p">physical resolution</a>.</p>
<p><strong>elevated administrator</strong></p>
<p>In User Account Control, elevated administrators have their administrator privileges. Without elevating, administrators run in their least-privileged state. The Consent UI dialog is used to elevate administrators to elevated status only when necessary. See also: <a href="#p">protected administrator</a>, <a href="#s">standard user</a>.</p>
<p><strong>enhanced tooltip</strong></p>
<p>A pop-up window that concisely explains the command being pointed to. Like regular tooltips, enhanced tooltips may provide the shortcut key for the command. But unlike regular tooltips, they may also provide supplemental information, graphics, and an indicator that Help is available. They may also use rich text and separators. See also: <a href="#t">tooltip</a>.</p>
<p><strong>error</strong></p>
<p>A state in which a problem has occurred. See also: <a href="#w">warning</a>.</p>

<p><strong>getting started page</strong></p>
<p>An optional wizard page that outlines prerequisites for running the wizard successfully or explains the purpose of the wizard.</p>
<p><strong>glass</strong></p>
<p>A window frame option characterized by translucence, helping users focus on content and functionality rather than the interface surrounding it.</p>
<p><strong>glyph</strong></p>
<p>A generic term used to refer to any graph or symbolic image. Arrows, chevrons, and bullets are glyphs commonly used in Windows.</p>
<p><strong>group box</strong></p>

<p>A special display setting that provides extreme contrast for foreground and background visual elements (either black on white or white on black). Particularly helpful for accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>hub page</strong></p>
<p>In control panel items, a hub page presents high-level choices, such as the most commonly used tasks (as with task-based hub pages) or the available objects (as with object-based hub pages). Users can navigate to spoke pages to perform specific tasks. See also: <a href="#s">spoke page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>hybrid hub page</strong></p>
<p>In control panel items, a hybrid hub page is a hub page that also has some properties or commands directly on it. Hybrid hub pages are strongly recommended when users are most likely to use the control panel item to access those properties and commands.</p>
<h2>I</h2>
<p><strong>immediate commit model</strong></p>
<p>The commit model used by hybrid hub pages where changes take effect as soon as users make them. Commit buttons aren't used in this model. See also: <a href="#d">delayed commit model</a>.</p>
<p><strong>in-place message</strong></p>
<p>A message that appears in the context of the current UI surface, instead of a separate window. Unlike separate windows, in-place messages require either available screen space or dynamic layout.</p>

<p>The raw output for a pen. This digital ink can be kept just as written, or it can be converted to text using handwriting recognition software.</p>
<p><strong>inline</strong></p>
<p>Placement of links or messages directly in the context of its related UI. For example, an inline link occurs within other text instead of separately.</p>
<p><strong>input focus</strong></p>
<p>The location where the user is currently directing input. Note that just because a location in the UI is highlighted does not necessarily mean this location has input focus.</p>
<p><strong>instance</strong></p>
<p>A program session. For example, Windows Internet Explorer allows users to run multiple instances of the program because users can have several independent sessions running at a time. Settings can be saved across program sessions. See also: <a href="#p">persistence</a>.</p>
<h2>J</h2>

<p><strong>list view</strong></p>
<p>A common Windows control that allows users to view and interact with a collection of data objects, using either single selection or multiple selection.</p>
<p><strong>live preview</strong></p>
<p>A preview technique that shows the effect of a command immediately on selection or hover without the user commiting the action. For example, formatting options such as themes, fonts, and colors benefit from live previews by showing users the effect with minimal effort.</p>
<p><strong>localization</strong></p>
<p>The process of adapting software for different countries, languages, cultures, or markets.</p>
<p><strong>log file</strong></p>
<p>A file-based repository for information of various kinds about activity on a computer system. Administrators often consult log files; ordinary users generally do not.</p>
<h2>M</h2>
<p><strong>main instruction</strong></p>
<p>Prominently displayed text that concisely explains what to do in the window or page. The instruction should be a specific statement, imperative direction, or question. Good main instructions communicate the user's objective rather than focusing just on manipulating the UI.</p>
<p><strong>managed environment</strong></p>
<p>A networked computer environment managed by an IT department or third-party provider, instead of by individual users. Administrators may optimize performance and apply operating system and application updates, among other tasks.</p>

<p><strong>owned window</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window used to perform an auxiliary task. It is not a top-level window (so it isn't displayed on the taskbar); rather, it is &quot;owned&quot; by its owner window. For example, most dialog boxes are owned windows. See also: <a href="#c">child window</a>, owner window.</p>
<p><strong>owner control</strong></p>
<p>The source of a tip, balloon, or flyout. For example, a text box that has input constraints might display a balloon to let the user know of these limitations. In this case, the text box is considered the owner control.</p>
<p><strong>owner window</strong></p>

<p><strong>pan</strong></p>
<p>To move a scene, such as a map or photo, in two dimensions by dragging it directly. This differs from scrolling in two ways: scrolled content usually has one predominant dimension and often scrolls only along that dimension; and scrolling content conventionally appears with scroll bars that the user drags in the opposite direction of the scrolling motion.</p>
<p><strong>pane</strong></p>
<p>A rectangular area within a window that users may be able to move, resize, hide, or close. Panes are always docked to the side of their parent window.

<p>A presentation option that orients an object to be taller than it is wide. See also: <a href="#l">landscape mode</a>.</p>
<p><strong>preferences</strong></p>
<p>Don't use. Use <a href="#o">options</a> or properties instead.</p>
<p><strong>preview</strong></p>
<p>A representation of what users will see when they select an option. Previews can be displayed statically as part of the option, or upon request with a Preview or Apply button.</p>
<p><strong>preview pane</strong></p>
<p>A window pane used to show previews and other data about selected objects.</p>
<p><strong>primary command</strong></p>

<p>A common Windows control that displays the progress of a particular operation as a graphical bar.</p>
<p><strong>progressive disclosure</strong></p>
<p>A technique of allowing users to display less commonly used information (typically, data, options, or commands) as needed. For example, if more options are sometimes needed, users can expose them in context by clicking a chevron button.</p>
<p><strong>progressive escalation</strong></p>
<p>A sequence in which the UI used to inform users becomes progressively more obtrusive as the event becomes more critical. For example, a notification can be used for an event that users can safely ignore at first. As the situation becomes critical, a more obtrusive UI such as a modal dialog should be used.</p>

<p>For sentence-style capitalization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always capitalize the first word of a new sentence.</li>
<li>Don't capitalize the word following a colon unless the word is a proper noun, or the text following the colon is a complete sentence.</li>
<li>Don't capitalize the word following an em-dash unless it is a proper noun, even if the text following the dash is a complete sentence.</li>

<p>Specific values that have been chosen (either by the user or by default) to configure a program or object.</p>
<p><strong>shortcut key</strong></p>
<p>Keys or key combinations that users can press for quick access to actions they perform frequently. Ctrl+letter combinations and function keys (F1 through F12) are usually the best choices for shortcut keys. By definition, a shortcut key is the keyboard equivalent of functionality that is supported adequately elsewhere in the interface. Therefore, avoid using a shortcut key as the only way to access a particular operation.</p>
<p>In contrast to access keys, which are designed to improve accessibility, shortcut keys are designed primarily for advanced users. Because they aren't documented directly within the UI itself (although they might be documented in menus and toolbar tooltips), they are intended to be memorized and therefore they must be assigned consistently within applications and across different applications.</p>

<p>A common Windows control that displays and sets a value from a continuous range of possible values, such as brightness or volume.</p>
<p><strong>special experience</strong></p>
<p>In programs, special experiences relate to the primary function of the program, something unique about the program, or otherwise make an emotional connection to users. For example, playing an audio or video is a special experience for a media player.</p>
<p><strong>spin box</strong></p>
<p>The combination of a text box and its associated spin control. Users click the up or down arrow of a spin box to increase or decrease a numeric value. Unlike slider controls, which are used for relative quantities, spin boxes are used only for exact, known numeric values.</p>

<p>In control panel items, spoke pages are the place in which users perform tasks. Two types of spoke pages are task pages and form pages: task pages present a task or a step in a task with a specific, task-based main instruction; form pages present a collection of related properties and tasks based on a general main instruction. See also: <a href="#h">hub page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>standard user</strong></p>
<p>In User Account Control, standard users have the least privileges on the computer, and must request permission from an administrator on the computer in order to perform administrative tasks. In contrast with protected administrators, standard users can't elevate themselves. See also: <a href="#e">elevated administrator</a>, <a href="#p">protected administrator</a>.</p>

<p><strong>system color</strong></p>
<p>A color defined by Windows for a specific purpose, accessed using the GetSysColor application programming interface (API). For example, COLOR_WINDOW defines the window background color and COLOR_WINDOWTEXT defines the window text color. System colors are not as rich as theme colors. See also: <a href="#t">theme color</a>.</p>

<p><strong>task pane</strong></p>
<p>A type of UI similar to a dialog box, except that it is presented within a window pane instead of a separate window. As a result, task panes have a more direct, contextual feel than dialog boxes. A task pane can contain a menu to provide the user with a small set of commands related to the selected object or program mode.</p>
<p><strong>taskbar</strong></p>
<p>The access point for running programs that have a desktop presence. Users interact with controls called taskbar buttons to show, hide, and minimize program windows.</p>
<p><strong>text box</strong></p>
<p>A control specifically designed for textual input; allows users to view, enter, or edit text or numbers.</p>
<p><strong>theme color</strong></p>
<p>A color defined by Windows for a specific purpose, accessed using the GetThemeColor API along with parts, states, and colors. For example, the windows part defines a FillColor and a TextColor. Theme colors are richer than system colors, but require the theme service to be running. See also: <a href="#s">system color</a>.</p>
<p><strong>title-style capitalization</strong></p>

Do not capitalize the second word if it is another part of speech, such as a preposition or other minor word (for example, Add-in, How-to, Take-off).</li>
<li>Capitalize user interface and application programming interface terms that you would not ordinarily capitalize, unless they are case-sensitive (for example, The fdisk Command). Follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms in programming languages (for example, The printf Function, Using the EVEN and ALIGN Directives).</li>

<p>A research technique that helps you improve your user experience by testing your UI design and gathering feedback from real target users. Usability studies can range from formal techniques in settings such as usability labs, to informal techniques in settings such as the user's own office. But the constants of such studies are: capturing information from the participants; evaluating that information for meaningful trends and patterns; and finally implementing logical changes that address the problems identified in the study.</p>
<p><strong>User Account Control</strong></p>
<p>With User Account Control (or UAC, formerly known as &quot;Least-privilege User Account,&quot; or LUA) enabled, interactive administrators normally run with least user privileges, but they can self-elevate to perform administrative tasks by giving explicit consent with the Consent UI. Such administrative tasks include installing software and drivers, changing system-wide settings, viewing or changing other user accounts, and running administrative tools.</p>
<p><strong>User Account Control shield</strong></p>
<p>A shield icon used to indicate that a command or option needs elevation for User Account Control.</p>

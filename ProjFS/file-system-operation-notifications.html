<h1>File System Operation Notifications</h1>
<p>In addition to required callbacks for handling enumeration, returning file metadata, and file contents, a provider may optionally register a <strong><a href="">PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</a></strong> callback in its call to <strong><a href="">PrjStartVirtualizing</a></strong>.  This callback receives notifications of file system operations performed on files and directories beneath the instance's virtualization root.  Some of the notifications are &quot;post-operation&quot; notifications, which tell the provider that an operation has just completed.  The other notifications are &quot;pre-operation&quot; notifications, meaning that the provider is notified before the operation happens.  In a pre-operation notification the provider can veto the operation by returning an error code from the callback.  This causes the operation to fail with the returned error code.</p>
<h2>How to Specify Notifications to Receive</h2>
<p>If the provider supplies an implementation of <strong>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</strong> when it starts a virtualization instance, it should also specify which notifications it wishes to receive.  The notifications for which the provider can register are defined in the <a href="/windows/win32/api/projectedfslib/ne-projectedfslib-prj_notification">PRJ_NOTIFICATION</a> enum.</p>
<p>When the provider specifies the notifications it wishes to receive, it does so using an array of one or more <a href="/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/ns-projectedfslib-prj_notification_mapping">PRJ_NOTIFICATION_MAPPING</a> structures.  These define &quot;notification mappings&quot;.  A notification mapping is a pairing between a directory, referred to as a &quot;notification root&quot;, and a set of notifications, expressed as a bit mask, which ProjFS should send for that directory and its descendants.  A notification mapping can also be established for a single file.  A file or directory specified in a notification mapping does not have to exist already at the time the provider calls <strong>PrjStartVirtualizing</strong>, the provider can specify any path and the mapping will apply to it if it is ever created.</p>
<p>If the provider specifies multiple notification mappings, and some are descendants of others, the mappings must be specified in descending depth.  Notification mappings at deeper levels override higher-level ones for their descendants.</p>
<p>If the provider does not specify a set of notification mappings, ProjFS will default to sending it PRJ_NOTIFY_FILE_OPENED, PRJ_NOTIFY_NEW_FILE_CREATED, and PRJ_NOTIFY_FILE_OVERWRITTEN for all files and directories beneath the virtualization root.</p>
<p>The following code snippet illustrates how to register a set of notifications when starting a virtualization instance.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>PRJ_CALLBACKS callbackTable;

// Supply required callbacks.
callbackTable.StartDirectoryEnumerationCallback = MyStartEnumCallback;
callbackTable.EndDirectoryEnumerationCallback = MyEndEnumCallback;
callbackTable.GetDirectoryEnumerationCallback = MyGetEnumCallback;
callbackTable.GetPlaceholderInfoCallback = MyGetPlaceholderInfoCallback;
callbackTable.GetFileDataCallback = MyGetFileDataCallback;

// The rest of the callbacks are optional.  We want notifications, so specify
// our notification callback.
callbackTable.QueryFileNameCallback = nullptr;
callbackTable.NotificationCallback = MyNotificationCallback;
callbackTable.CancelCommandCallback = nullptr;

// Assume the provider has created a new virtualization root at C:\VirtRoot and
// initialized it with this layout:
//
//     C:\VirtRoot
//     +--- baz
//     \--- foo
//          +--- subdir1
//          \--- subdir2
//
// The provider wants these notifications:
// * Notification of new file/directory creates for all locations within the
//   virtualization root that are not subject to one of the following more
//   specific notification mappings.
// * Notification of new file/directory creates, file opens, post-renames, and
//   pre- and post-deletes for C:\VirtRoot\foo
// * No notifications for C:\VirtRoot\foo\subdir1

// deletes for C:\VirtRoot\foo and its descendants.

<h2>Receiving Notifications</h2>
<p>ProjFS sends notifications of file system operations by calling the provider's <strong>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</strong> callback.  It does this for each operation the provider has registered for.  If, as in the above example, the provider registered for PRJ_NOTIFY_NEW_FILE_CREATED | PRJ_NOTIFY_FILE_OPENED | PRJ_NOTIFY_PRE_DELETE | PRJ_NOTIFY_FILE_HANDLE_CLOSED_FILE_DELETED | PRJ_NOTIFY_FILE_RENAMED, and an application created a new file in the notification root, ProjFS would call the <strong>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</strong> callback with the new file's path name and the <em>notification</em> parameter set to PRJ_NOTIFICATION_NEW_FILE_CREATED.</p>
<p>ProjFS sends the notifications in the following list before the associated file system operation takes place.  If the provider returns a failure code from the <strong>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</strong> callback, the file system operation will fail and return the failure code the provider specified.</p>
<ul>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_PRE_DELETE - The file is about to be deleted.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_PRE_RENAME - The file is about to be renamed.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_PRE_SET_HARDLINK - A hard link is about to be created for the file.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_PRE_CONVERT_TO_FULL - A file is about to be expanded from a placeholder to a full file, which indicates its contents are likely to be modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>ProjFS sends the notifications in the following list after the associated file system operation has completed.</p>
<ul>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OPENED - An existing file has been opened.
<ul>
<li>Even though this notification is sent after the file has been opened, the provider can return a failure code.  In response, ProjFS will cancel the open and return the failure to the caller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_NEW_FILE_CREATED - A new file has been created.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OVERWRITTEN - An existing file has been overwritten, for example by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew">CreateFileW</a> with the <strong>CREATE_ALWAYS</strong> <em>dwCreationDisposition</em> flag.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_RENAMED - A file has been renamed.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_HARDLINK_CREATED - A <a href="/windows/desktop/FileIO/hard-links-and-junctions#hard-links">hard link</a> has been created for a file.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_HANDLE_CLOSED_NO_MODIFICATION - A file handle has been closed, and the file's content was not modified, nor was the file deleted.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_HANLDE_CLOSED_FILE_MODIFIED - A file handle has been closed, and the file's content has been modified.</li>
<li>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_HANDLE_CLOSED_FILE_DELETED - A file handle has been closed, and the file was deleted as part of closing the handle.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details on each notification refer to the documentation for <strong><a href="/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/ne-projectedfslib-prj_notification">PRJ_NOTIFICATION</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</strong> callback's <em>notificationParameters</em> parameter specifies extra parameters for certain notifications.  If a provider receives a PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OPENED, PRJ_NOTIFICATION_NEW_FILE_CREATED, or PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_OVERWRITTEN, or PRJ_NOTIFICATION_FILE_RENAMED notification, the provider can specify a new set of notifications to receive for the file. For further details, refer to the documentation for <strong><a href="/windows/desktop/api/projectedfslib/nc-projectedfslib-prj_notification_cb">PRJ_NOTIFICATION_CB</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The following sample shows simple examples of how a provider might process the notifications it registered for in the code snippet above.</p>

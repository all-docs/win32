<h1>About Multimedia File I/O</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/multimedia-file-i-o">Multimedia File I/O</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> instead of <strong>Multimedia File I/O</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Most multimedia applications require file input and output (I/O) â€” that is, the ability to create, read, and write disk files. Multimedia file I/O services provide buffered and unbuffered file I/O and support for RIFF files. The services are extensible with custom I/O procedures that can be shared among applications.</p>
<p>Most applications need only the basic file I/O services and the RIFF file I/O services. Applications sensitive to file I/O performance, such as applications that stream data from compact disc in real time, can optimize performance by using services to directly access the file I/O buffer. Applications that access custom storage systems, such as file archives and databases, can provide their own I/O procedure that reads and writes elements of the storage system.</p>

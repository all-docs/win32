<h1>Opening and Closing Mixer Devices</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/audio-mixers">Audio Mixers</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/coreaudio/volume-controls">Volume Controls</a>. <strong>Volume Controls</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Volume Controls</strong> instead of <strong>Audio Mixers</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>When you want to use a mixer device, you can either simply begin using it or you can explicitly open the device before using it. Explicitly opening a mixer device offers two main benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It guarantees the continued existence of that mixer device.</li>
<li>It lets you receive notification of audio line and control changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/nf-mmeapi-mixeropen"><strong>mixerOpen</strong></a> function to explicitly open a mixer device. This function takes as parameters a device identifier, a pointer to a memory location, and other values unique to each type of device. The memory location is filled with a device handle. Use this device handle to identify the open mixer device when calling other audio mixer functions. As long as a handle of a mixer device exists, the device continues to exist in the system. If a configuration change occurs to the mixer device and it hasn't been explicitly opened, your application might suddenly be unable to access it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The difference between device identifiers and device handles is important. Device handles are returned when you open a device driver by using <strong>mixerOpen</strong>. Device identifiers are determined implicitly from the number of devices present in a system; this number is obtained by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/nf-mmeapi-mixergetnumdevs"><strong>mixerGetNumDevs</strong></a> function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>You can use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/nf-mmeapi-mixerclose"><strong>mixerClose</strong></a> function to close a mixer device. You should close the device after you finish using it.</p>

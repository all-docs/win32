<h1>Level 2 System Resources</h1>
<p>The minimum configuration for a PC to satisfy the Level 2 specification includes the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 25 Mhz 486SX microprocessor with 4 MB of RAM</li>
<li>A 3.5-inch high-density floppy disk drive</li>
<li>A hard disk drive with at least 160 MB of disk space</li>
<li>A 101-key keyboard with a standard DIN connector or one that provides identical functionality by using key combinations</li>
<li>A two-button mouse with a serial or bus connector</li>
<li>A MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) port that includes MIDI Out, MIDI In, and MIDI Thru, and that has interrupt support for input and FIFO transfer</li>
<li>An IBM-style analog or digital joystick (game) port</li>
<li>A color monitor with a display resolution of 640 by 480 pixels with 65,536 colors</li>
<li>System software that offers binary compatibility with Windows 3.0 or Windows 3.1</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the recommended performance goal for the video adapter (VGA+) is 1.2 million pixels per second using 40 percent or less of the CPU bandwidth. The device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) used to measure this performance goal have color depths of 1, 4, and 8 bits, and can use run-length encoding or be unencoded. A second method of measuring the video performance is to deliver 256-color, 320 by 240 pixel digital-video images at 15 frames per second.</p>

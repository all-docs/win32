<h1>About AVIFile Functions and Macros</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/avifile-functions-and-macros">AVIFile Functions and Macros</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> instead of <strong>AVIFile Functions and Macros</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The AVIFile functions and macros handle the information in time-based files as one or more <em>data streams</em> instead of tagged blocks of data called chunks. Data streams refer to the components of a time-based file. An AVI file can contain several different types of data, such as a video sequence, an English soundtrack, and a French soundtrack. Using AVIFile, an application can access each of these components separately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Although the AVIFile functions and macros work with any RIFF file, this overview demonstrates their use with AVI files only. AVI files are typically the time-based files used with the AVIFile macros and functions.</p>

<p>AVIFile functions and macros are contained in a dynamic-link library. To initialize the library, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/nf-vfw-avifileinit"><strong>AVIFileInit</strong></a> function. After you initialize the library, you can use any of the AVIFile functions or macros. To release the library, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Vfw/nf-vfw-avifileexit"><strong>AVIFileExit</strong></a> function. AVIFile maintains a reference count of the applications that are using the library, but not those that have released it. Your applications should balance each use of <strong>AVIFileInit</strong> with a call to <strong>AVIFileExit</strong> to completely release the library after each application finishes using it.</p>

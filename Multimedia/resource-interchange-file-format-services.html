<h1>Resource Interchange File Format Services</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/multimedia-file-i-o">Multimedia File I/O</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> instead of <strong>Multimedia File I/O</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The preferred format for multimedia files is resource interchange file format (RIFF). The RIFF file I/O functions work with the basic buffered and unbuffered file I/O services. You can open, read, and write RIFF files in the same way as other file types. For detailed information about RIFF, see <a href="avifile-functions-and-macros.html">AVIFile Functions and Macros</a>.</p>
<p>RIFF files use four-character codes to identify file elements. These codes are 32-bit quantities representing a sequence of one to four ASCII alphanumeric characters, padded on the right with space characters. The data type for four-character codes is <strong>FOURCC</strong>. Use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/vfw/nf-vfw-mmiofourcc"><strong>mmioFOURCC</strong></a> macro to convert four characters into a four-character code. To convert a null-terminated string into a four-character code, use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmiscapi/nf-mmiscapi-mmiostringtofourcc"><strong>mmioStringToFOURCC</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>The basic building block of a RIFF file is a <em>chunk</em>. A chunk is a logical unit of multimedia data, such as a single frame in a video clip. Each chunk contains the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>A four-character code specifying the chunk identifier</li>
<li>A doubleword value specifying the size of the data member in the chunk</li>
<li>A data field</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows a &quot;RIFF&quot; chunk that contains two subchunks.</p>
<p><img src="images/mmio1.gif" alt="riff chunk that contains two subchunks image" /></p>
<p>A chunk contained in another chunk is a <em>subchunk</em>. The only chunks allowed to contain subchunks are those with a chunk identifier of &quot;RIFF&quot; or &quot;LIST&quot;. A chunk that contains another chunk is called a <em>parent chunk</em>. The first chunk in a RIFF file must be a &quot;RIFF&quot; chunk. All other chunks in the file are subchunks of the &quot;RIFF&quot; chunk.</p>
<p>&quot;RIFF&quot; chunks include an additional field in the first four bytes of the data field. This additional field provides the <em>form type</em> of the field. The form type is a four-character code identifying the format of the data stored in the file. For example, Microsoft waveform-audio files have a form type of &quot;WAVE&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;LIST&quot; chunks also include an additional field in the first four bytes of the data field. This additional field contains the <em>list type</em> of the field. The list type is a four-character code identifying the contents of the list. For example, a &quot;LIST&quot; chunk with a list type of &quot;INFO&quot; can contain &quot;ICOP&quot; and &quot;ICRD&quot; chunks providing copyright and creation date information. The following illustration shows a &quot;RIFF&quot; chunk that contains a &quot;LIST&quot; chunk and one other subchunk (the &quot;LIST&quot; chunk contains two subchunks).</p>
<p><img src="images/mmio2.gif" alt="riff chunk that contains a list chunk image" /></p>
<p>Multimedia file I/O services include two functions you can use to navigate among chunks in a RIFF file: <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmiscapi/nf-mmiscapi-mmioascend"><strong>mmioAscend</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmiscapi/nf-mmiscapi-mmiodescend"><strong>mmioDescend</strong></a>. You can use these functions as high-level seek functions. When you descend into a chunk, the file position is set to the data field of the chunk (8 bytes from the beginning of the chunk). For &quot;RIFF&quot; and &quot;LIST&quot; chunks, the file position is set to the location following the form type or list type (12 bytes from the beginning of the chunk). When you ascend out of a chunk, the file position is set to the location following the end of the chunk.</p>
<p>To create a new chunk, use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmiscapi/nf-mmiscapi-mmiocreatechunk"><strong>mmioCreateChunk</strong></a> function to write a chunk header at the current position in an open file. The <strong>mmioAscend</strong>, <strong>mmioDescend</strong>, and <strong>mmioCreateChunk</strong> functions use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmiscapi/ns-mmiscapi-mmckinfo"><strong>MMCKINFO</strong></a> structure to specify and retrieve information about &quot;RIFF&quot; chunks.</p>

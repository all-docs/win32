<h1>Device Names</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/mci">MCI</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>. <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> instead of <strong>MCI</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>For each device type, there might be several MCI drivers that share the command set but operate on different data formats. To uniquely identify an MCI driver, MCI uses <em>device names</em>.</p>
<p>Device names are identified either in the [mci] section of the SYSTEM.INI file or in the appropriate part of the registry. This information identifies all MCI drivers to Windows. The entries in the [mci] section use the following form:</p>
<p><em>device_name</em> = <em>driver_filename.extension</em></p>
<p>The following example shows a typical [mci] section from SYSTEM.INI:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>[mci]
cdaudio=mcicda.drv 
sequencer=mciseq.drv 
waveaudio=mciwave.drv 
avivideo=mciavi.drv
</code></pre>
<p>If an MCI driver is installed using a device name that already exists in SYSTEM.INI or the registry, the system appends an integer to the device name of the new driver, creating a unique device name. In the preceding example, an additional driver installed using the &quot;cdaudio&quot; device name would be assigned the device name &quot;cdaudio1&quot;.</p>

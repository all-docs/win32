<h1>The Wait Flag</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/mci">MCI</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>. <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> instead of <strong>MCI</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>MCI commands usually return to the user immediately, even if it takes several minutes to complete the action initiated by the command. You can use the &quot;wait&quot; (MCI_WAIT) flag to direct the device to wait until the requested action is completed before returning control to the application.</p>
<p>For example, the following <a href="play.html"><strong>play</strong></a> command will not return control to the application until the playback completes:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>mciSendString(&quot;play mydevice from 0 to 100 wait&quot;, 
    lpszReturnString, lstrlen(lpszReturnString), NULL);
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The user can cancel a wait operation by pressing a break key. By default, this key is CTRL+BREAK. Applications can redefine this key by using the <a href="break.html"><strong>break</strong></a> (<a href="mci-break.html"><strong>MCI_BREAK</strong></a>) command. (<strong>MCI_BREAK</strong> uses the <a href="mci-break-parms.html"><strong>MCI_BREAK_PARMS</strong></a> structure.) When a wait operation is canceled, MCI attempts to return control to the application without interrupting the command associated with the &quot;wait&quot; flag.</p>

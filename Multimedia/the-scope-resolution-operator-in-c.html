<h1>The Scope Resolution Operator in C++</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/custom-file-and-stream-handlers">Custom File and Stream Handlers</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource">MediaStreamSource class</a>. <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> instead of <strong>Custom File and Stream Handlers</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Two colons (::) are used in C++ as a <em>scope resolution</em> operator. This operator gives you more freedom in naming your variables by letting you distinguish between variables with the same name. For example, <em>MyFile::Read</em> refers to the <em>Read</em> method of the <em>MyFile</em> class of objects, as opposed to <em>YourFile::Read</em>, which refers to a <em>Read</em> method in the <em>YourFile</em> class.</p>

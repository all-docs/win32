<h1>Recording</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/mci">MCI</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>. <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> instead of <strong>MCI</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The general MCI specification supports recording with digital-video, MIDI sequencer, video-cassette recorder (VCR), and waveform-audio devices; however, only waveform-audio and VCR devices currently implement recording capabilities. You can insert or overwrite recorded information into an existing file or record into a new file. To record to an existing file, open a waveform-audio device and file as you would normally. To record into a new file, when you open the device specify &quot;new&quot; as the device name if you are using the command-string interface. If you are using the command-message interface, specify a zero-length filename.</p>
<p>When MCI creates a new file for recording, the data format is set to a default format specified by the device driver. To use a format other than the default format, you can use the <a href="set.html"><strong>set</strong></a> (<a href="mci-set.html"><strong>MCI_SET</strong></a>) command.</p>
<p>To begin recording, use the <a href="record.html"><strong>record</strong></a> command (or <a href="mci-record.html"><strong>MCI_RECORD</strong></a> and the <a href="mci-record-parms.html"><strong>MCI_RECORD_PARMS</strong></a> structure).</p>
<p>If you record in insert mode to an existing file, you can use the &quot;from&quot; (MCI_FROM) and &quot;to&quot; (MCI_TO) flags of the <strong>record</strong> command to specify starting and ending positions for recording. For example, if you record to a file that is 20 seconds long, and you begin recording at 5 seconds and end recording at 10 seconds, the resulting file will be 25 seconds long. The file will have a 5-second segment inserted 5 seconds into the original recording.</p>
<p>If you record with overwrite mode to an existing file, you can use the &quot;from&quot; and &quot;to&quot; flags to specify starting and ending locations of the section that is overwritten. For example, if you record to a file that is 20 seconds long, and you begin recording at 5 seconds and end recording at 10 seconds, you still have a recording 20 seconds long, but the section beginning at 5 seconds and ending at 10 seconds will have been replaced.</p>
<p>If you do not specify an ending location, recording continues until you send a <a href="stop.html"><strong>stop</strong></a> (<a href="mci-stop.html"><strong>MCI_STOP</strong></a>) command, or until the driver runs out of free disk space. If you record to a new file, you can omit the &quot;from&quot; flag or set it to zero to start recording at the beginning of a new file. You can specify an ending location to terminate recording when recording to a new file.</p>
<p>The <a href="record.html"><strong>record</strong></a> command is sometimes accurate to within only 1 second of the starting location, such as with VCR devices. To record more accurately, you should use the <a href="cue.html"><strong>cue</strong></a> (<a href="mci-cue.html"><strong>MCI_CUE</strong></a>) command. This command is recognized by digital-video, VCR, and waveform-audio devices. For more information about recording with VCR devices, see <a href="vcr-services.html">VCR Services</a>.</p>
<h2>Saving a Recorded File</h2>
<p>When recording is complete, use the <a href="save.html"><strong>save</strong></a> command (or <a href="mci-save.html"><strong>MCI_SAVE</strong></a> and the <a href="mci-save-parms.html"><strong>MCI_SAVE_PARMS</strong></a> structure) to save the recording before closing the device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If you close the device without saving, the recorded data is lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Checking Input Levels (PCM Only)</h2>
<p>To get the level of the input signal before recording on a PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) waveform-audio input device, use the <a href="status.html"><strong>status</strong></a> (<a href="mci-status.html"><strong>MCI_STATUS</strong></a>) command. Specify the &quot;level&quot; flag (or the MCI_STATUS_ITEM flag and set the <strong>dwItem</strong> member of the <a href="mci-status-parms.html"><strong>MCI_STATUS_PARMS</strong></a> structure to MCI_WAVE_STATUS_LEVEL). The average input signal level is returned. The left-channel value is in the high-order word and the right- or mono-channel value is in the low-order word.</p>
<p>The input level is represented as an unsigned value. For 8-bit samples, this value is in the range 0 through 127 (0x7F). For 16-bit samples, it is in the range 0 through 32,767 (0x7FFF).</p>

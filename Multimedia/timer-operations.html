<h1>Timer Event Operations</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/multimedia-timers">Multimedia Timers</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/procthread/multimedia-class-scheduler-service">Multimedia Class Scheduler Service</a>. <strong>Multimedia Class Scheduler Service</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Multimedia Class Scheduler Service</strong> instead of <strong>Multimedia Timers</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>After you have established your application's timer resolution, you can start timer events by using the <a href="/previous-versions//dd757634(v=vs.85)"><strong>timeSetEvent</strong></a> function. This function returns a timer identifier that can be used to stop or identify timer events. One of the function's parameters is the address of a <a href="/previous-versions//dd757631(v=vs.85)"><strong>TimeProc</strong></a> callback function that is called when the timer event takes place.</p>
<p>There are two types of timer events: <em>single</em> and <em>periodic</em>. A single timer event occurs once, after a specified number of milliseconds. A periodic timer event occurs every time a specified number of milliseconds elapses. The interval between periodic events is called an <em>event delay</em>. Periodic timer events with an event delay of 10 milliseconds or less consume a significant portion of CPU resources.</p>
<p>The relationship between the resolution of a timer event and the length of the event delay is important in timer events. For example, if you specify a resolution of 5 and an event delay of 100, the timer services notify the callback function after an interval ranging from 95 to 105 milliseconds.</p>
<p>You can cancel an active timer event at any time by using the <a href="/previous-versions//dd757630(v=vs.85)"><strong>timeKillEvent</strong></a> function. Be sure to cancel any outstanding timers before freeing the memory containing the callback function.</p>

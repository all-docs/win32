<h1>Adding Drivers Within an Application</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/audio-compression-manager">ï»¿Audio Compression Manager</a>, is a legacy feature. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code does not use this feature.]</p>
<p>If you need your application to implement its own compression routines internally, the application can add drivers to the ACM by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msacm/nf-msacm-acmdriveradd"><strong>acmDriverAdd</strong></a> function. The application implements the driver by providing a function that conforms to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msacm/nc-msacm-acmdriverproc"><strong>acmDriverProc</strong></a> prototype. After the application has added the driver, the application can use the driver through the ACM as it would use any other driver.</p>
<p>The ACM treats drivers as either global or local. An application specifies whether a driver should be added as global or local when it calls <strong>acmDriverAdd</strong>. There are two differences between global and local drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers added as global drivers are not shared with other applications.</li>
<li>An application can directly alter the priority of a global driver (but not a local driver) by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msacm/nf-msacm-acmdriverpriority"><strong>acmDriverPriority</strong></a> function. The ACM conducts a prioritized search when seeking an appropriate driver to provide an implementation of a function call. The ACM always gives local drivers higher priority than global drivers. The most recently added local driver has highest priority.</li>
</ul>

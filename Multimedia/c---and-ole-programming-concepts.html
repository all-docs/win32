<h1>C++ and OLE Programming Concepts</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/custom-file-and-stream-handlers">Custom File and Stream Handlers</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource">MediaStreamSource class</a>. <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> instead of <strong>Custom File and Stream Handlers</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The file and stream handlers included with Windows use an object-oriented design to promote a standard interface and to share functionality. These handlers are written in C++ and use the OLE Component Object Model.</p>
<p>You can develop custom handlers using the C or C++ development systems; however, using C++ is strongly recommended, because it provides an easier and more straightforward approach to implement a handler. Using C++, you can explicitly define data as objects, and you can associate the functions that manipulate the data with the member functions of an object.</p>
<p>This section identifies and briefly summarizes the important concepts of C++ and the OLE Component Object Model that apply to designing and implementing file and stream handlers. There are many books written about C++ programming that you can reference for more information. For more information on OLE, please see the <em>OLE Programmer's Reference</em>.</p>

<h1>About Custom File and Stream Handlers</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/custom-file-and-stream-handlers">Custom File and Stream Handlers</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource">MediaStreamSource class</a>. <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> instead of <strong>Custom File and Stream Handlers</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Your application can use a custom file handler to read from a file or write to a file that is in a nonstandard format. To do this, your application simply uses the name of your file handler when opening the file or allocating the file interface. The AVIFile library then uses the functions from your file handler instead of those from another file handler. The nonstandard format appears as standard AVI data to your application or to any other application using your custom file handler.</p>
<p>Similarly, your application can use a custom stream handler to read a stream that is in a nonstandard format. A stream â€” whether it constitutes audio, video, MIDI, text, or custom data â€” is a component of an AVI file. For example, an AVI file that contains a video sequence, an English soundtrack, and a French soundtrack consists of three streams. Your application can specify the streams in an AVI file to process and direct each of those streams to a handler that can optimally process the appropriate type of multimedia data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
You must place custom stream and file handlers in one or more DLLs, separated from main application files.</p>

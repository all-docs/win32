<h1>Mixer Architecture</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/audio-mixers">Audio Mixers</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/coreaudio/volume-controls">Volume Controls</a>. <strong>Volume Controls</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Volume Controls</strong> instead of <strong>Audio Mixers</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The basic element of the mixer architecture is an <em>audio line</em>. An audio line consists of one or more channels of data originating from a single source or a system resource. For example, a stereo audio line has two data channels, but it is considered a single audio line because it originates from a single source.</p>
<p>The mixer architecture provides routing services to manage audio lines on a computer. You can use the routing services if you have adequate hardware devices and software drivers installed. The mixer architecture allows several audio source lines to map to a single destination audio line.</p>
<p>Each audio line can have mixer controls associated with it. A mixer control can perform any number of functions (such as control volume), depending on the characteristics of the associated audio line.</p>

<h1>The Notify Flag</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/mci">MCI</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer">MediaPlayer</a>. <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaPlayer</strong> instead of <strong>MCI</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The &quot;notify&quot; (MCI_NOTIFY) flag directs the device to post an <a href="mm-mcinotify.html"><strong>MM MCINOTIFY</strong></a> message when the device completes an action. Your application must have a window procedure to process the MM_MCINOTIFY message for notification to have any effect. An MM_MCINOTIFY message indicates that the processing of a command has completed, but it does not indicate whether the command was completed successfully, failed, or was superseded or aborted.</p>
<p>The application specifies the handle to the destination window for the message when it issues a command. In the command-string interface, this handle is the last parameter of the <a href="/previous-versions//dd757161(v=vs.85)"><strong>mciSendString</strong></a> function. In the command-message interface, the handle is specified in the low-order word of the <strong>dwCallBack</strong> member of the structure sent with the command message. (Every structure associated with a command message contains this member.)</p>

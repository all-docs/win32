<h1>Processing MIDI Data from Two MIDI Sources</h1>
<p>The MIDI subsystem can route MIDI messages from two data sources to a single MIDI output device for concurrent playback. For example, one source can be background music or a bass line that has been pre-recorded and stored in a file. The second source can be live data from a MIDI instrument, such as a keyboard or guitar.</p>
<p>Both data sources send MIDI data to a single MIDI device that is identified with one handle. Send one data stream by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/nf-mmeapi-midistreamout"><strong>midiStreamOut</strong></a> function and one or more stream buffers. This data stream typically contains prerecorded data that is packed into the buffer.</p>
<p>Send the second data stream (typically from a MIDI instrument) asynchronously by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/mmeapi/nf-mmeapi-midioutshortmsg"><strong>midiOutShortMsg</strong></a> function. The running status of a stream buffer will not be adversely affected by the asynchronous calls made by the second data stream.</p>
<p>Each short message sent with <strong>midiOutShortMsg</strong> must be a complete MIDI message, with a status byte and the appropriate number of data bytes. If the status byte is omitted, <strong>midiOutShortMsg</strong> returns an error. (However, there is no running status with stream output.)</p>

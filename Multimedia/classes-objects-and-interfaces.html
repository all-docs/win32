<h1>Classes, Objects, and Interfaces</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/multimedia/custom-file-and-stream-handlers">Custom File and Stream Handlers</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Core.MediaStreamSource">MediaStreamSource class</a>. <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>MediaStreamSource class</strong> instead of <strong>Custom File and Stream Handlers</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>In the C++ programming language, a <em>class</em> consists of <em>properties</em> (or member data) and <em>methods</em> (or member functions). The properties are data elements, such as those contained in a structure. The methods are used for a variety of purposes, such as initialization, assignment, operations, and data access. You use a class declaration in the same way that you use a structure declaration. Memory is allocated for a class when you define a class <em>object</em>. Each class object has a data area for its properties and a table of pointers to the methods it supports.</p>
<p>In OLE, an object consists of data and methods, as it does in C++. However, an OLE object adheres to stricter rules. The data is strictly internal. An object only exposes interfaces. An <em>interface</em> is a set of related methods for an object. Each object can support multiple interfaces. All OLE interfaces support the <a href="/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown">IUnknown</a> interface.</p>

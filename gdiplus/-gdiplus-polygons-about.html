<h1>Polygons</h1>
<p>A polygon is a closed figure with three or more straight sides. For example, a triangle is a polygon with three sides, a rectangle is a polygon with four sides, and a pentagon is a polygon with five sides. The following illustration shows several polygons.</p>

<p>To draw a polygon, you need a <a href="/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> object, a <a href="/windows/win32/api/gdipluspen/nl-gdipluspen-pen"><strong>Pen</strong></a> object, and an array of <a href="/windows/win32/api/gdiplustypes/nl-gdiplustypes-point"><strong>Point</strong></a> (or <a href="/windows/win32/api/gdiplustypes/nl-gdiplustypes-pointf"><strong>PointF</strong></a>) objects. The <strong>Graphics</strong> object provides the <a href="/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawpolygon(inconstpen_inconstpoint_inint)">DrawPolygon</a> method. The <strong>Pen</strong> object stores attributes of the polygon, such as line width and color, and the array of <strong>Point</strong> objects stores the points to be connected by straight lines. The addresses of the <strong>Pen</strong> object and the array of <strong>Point</strong> objects are passed as arguments to the DrawPolygon method. The following example draws a three-sided polygon. Note that there are only three points in <strong>myPointArray</strong>: (0, 0), (50, 30), and (30, 60). The DrawPolygon method automatically closes the polygon by drawing a line from (30, 60) back to the starting point (0, 0);</p>
<pre><code>Point myPointArray[] =
   {Point(0, 0), Point(50, 30), Point(30, 60)};
myGraphics.DrawPolygon(&amp;myPen, myPointArray, 3);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the polygon.</p>

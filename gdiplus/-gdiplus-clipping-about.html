<h1>Clipping (GDI+)</h1>
<p>Clipping involves restricting drawing to a certain region. The following illustration shows the string &quot;Hello&quot; clipped to a heart-shaped region.</p>
<p><img src="images/aboutgdip02-art30.png" alt="illustration showing parts of the string &quot;hello&quot; within a red heart" /></p>
<p>Regions can be constructed from paths, and paths can contain the outlines of strings, so you can use outlined text for clipping. The following illustration shows a set of concentric ellipses clipped to the interior of a string of text.</p>
<p><img src="images/aboutgdip02-art31.png" alt="illustration showing the string &quot;hello&quot; filled by a pattern of concentric circles" /></p>
<p>To draw with clipping, create a <a href="/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> object, call its <a href="/windows/win32/api/gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-setclip(inconstregion_incombinemode)">SetClip</a> method, and then call the drawing methods of that same <strong>Graphics</strong> object. The following example draws a line that is clipped to a rectangular region.</p>
<pre><code>Region myRegion(Rect(20, 30, 100, 50));
myGraphics.DrawRectangle(&amp;myPen, 20, 30, 100, 50);  
myGraphics.SetClip(&amp;myRegion, CombineModeReplace);
myGraphics.DrawLine(&amp;myPen, 0, 0, 200, 200);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the rectangular region along with the clipped line.</p>

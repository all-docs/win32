<h1>Drawing a Line with Line Caps</h1>
<p>You can draw the start or end of a line in one of several shapes called line caps. Windows GDI+ supports several line caps, such as round, square, diamond, and arrowhead.</p>
<p>You can specify line caps for the start of a line (start cap), the end of a line (end cap), or the dashes of a dashed line (dash cap).</p>
<p>The following example draws a line with an arrowhead at one end and a round cap at the other end:</p>
<pre><code>Pen pen(Color(255, 0, 0, 255), 8);
stat = pen.SetStartCap(LineCapArrowAnchor);
stat = pen.SetEndCap(LineCapRoundAnchor);
stat = graphics.DrawLine(&amp;pen, 20, 175, 300, 175);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the resulting line.</p>
<p><img src="images/pens4.png" alt="illustration showing a horizontal line with an arrow at the left end and a circle at the right end" /></p>
<p><strong>LineCapArrowAnchor</strong> and <strong>LineCapRoundAnchor</strong> are elements of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusenums/ne-gdiplusenums-linecap"><strong>LineCap</strong></a> enumeration.</p>

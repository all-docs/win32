<h1>Constructing and Drawing Curves</h1>
<p>GDI+ supports several types of curves: ellipses, arcs, cardinal splines, and BÃ©zier splines. An ellipse is defined by its bounding rectangle; an arc is a portion of an ellipse defined by a starting angle and a sweep angle. A cardinal spline is defined by an array of points and a tension parameter â€” the curve passes smoothly through each point in the array, and the tension parameter influences the way the curve bends. A BÃ©zier spline is defined by two end points and two control points â€” the curve does not pass through the control points, but the control points influence the direction and bend as the curve goes from one end point to the other.</p>
<p>The following topics cover cardinal splines and BÃ©zier splines in more detail:</p>

<h1>Setting Pen Width and Alignment</h1>
<p>When you create a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdipluspen/nl-gdipluspen-pen"><strong>Pen</strong></a> object, you can supply the pen width as one of the arguments to the constructor. You can also change the pen width by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Gdipluspen/nf-gdipluspen-pen-setwidth"><strong>Pen::SetWidth</strong></a> method.</p>
<p>A theoretical line has a width of zero. When you draw a line, the pixels are centered on the theoretical line. The following example draws a specified line twice: once with a black pen of width 1 and once with a green pen of width 10.</p>
<pre><code>Pen blackPen(Color(255, 0, 0, 0), 1);
Pen greenPen(Color(255, 0, 255, 0), 10);
stat = greenPen.SetAlignment(PenAlignmentCenter);

// Draw the line with the wide green pen.
stat = graphics.DrawLine(&amp;greenPen, 10, 100, 100, 50);

// Draw the same line with the thin black pen.
stat = graphics.DrawLine(&amp;blackPen, 10, 100, 100, 50);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the output of the preceding code. The green pixels and the black pixels are centered on the theoretical line.</p>
<p><img src="images/pens1a.png" alt="illustration showing a thin, diagonal, black line surrounded by a wide, green line " /></p>
<p>The following example draws a specified rectangle twice: once with a black pen of width 1 and once with a green pen of width 10. The code passes the value <strong>PenAlignmentCenter</strong> (an element of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusenums/ne-gdiplusenums-penalignment"><strong>PenAlignment</strong></a> enumeration) to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Gdipluspen/nf-gdipluspen-pen-setalignment"><strong>Pen::SetAlignment</strong></a> method to specify that the pixels drawn with the green pen are centered on the boundary of the rectangle.</p>
<pre><code>Pen blackPen(Color(255, 0, 0, 0), 1);
Pen greenPen(Color(255, 0, 255, 0), 10);
stat = greenPen.SetAlignment(PenAlignmentCenter);

// Draw the rectangle with the wide green pen.
stat = graphics.DrawRectangle(&amp;greenPen, 10, 100, 50, 50);

// Draw the same rectangle with the thin black pen.
stat = graphics.DrawRectangle(&amp;blackPen, 10, 100, 50, 50);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the output of the preceding code. The green pixels are centered on the theoretical rectangle, which is represented by the black pixels.</p>
<p><img src="images/pens2.png" alt="illustration showing a thin black line in the shape of a rectangle, surrounded by a wider green line" /></p>
<p>You can change the green pen's alignment by modifying the third statement in the preceding example as follows:</p>
<pre><code>stat = greenPen.SetAlignment(PenAlignmentInset);
</code></pre>
<p>Now the pixels in the wide green line appear on the inside of the rectangle as shown in the following illustration.</p>

<h1>Clipping with a Region</h1>
<p>One of the properties of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> class is the clipping region. All drawing done by a given <strong>Graphics</strong> object is restricted to the clipping region of that <strong>Graphics</strong> object. You can set the clipping region by calling the <strong>SetClip</strong> method.</p>
<p>The following example constructs a path that consists of a single polygon. Then the code constructs a region based on that path. The address of the region is passed to the <strong>SetClip</strong> method of a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> object, and then two strings are drawn.</p>
<pre><code>// Create a path that consists of a single polygon.
Point polyPoints[] = {Point(10, 10), Point(150, 10), 
   Point(100, 75), Point(100, 150)};
GraphicsPath path;
path.AddPolygon(polyPoints, 4);
// Construct a region based on the path.
Region region(&amp;path);
// Draw the outline of the region.
Pen pen(Color(255, 0, 0, 0));
graphics.DrawPath(&amp;pen, &amp;path);
// Set the clipping region of the Graphics object.
graphics.SetClip(&amp;region);
// Draw some clipped strings.
FontFamily fontFamily(L&quot;Arial&quot;);
Font font(&amp;fontFamily, 36, FontStyleBold, UnitPixel);
SolidBrush solidBrush(Color(255, 255, 0, 0));
graphics.DrawString(L&quot;A Clipping Region&quot;, 20, &amp;font, 
   PointF(15, 25), &amp;solidBrush);
graphics.DrawString(L&quot;A Clipping Region&quot;, 20, &amp;font, 
   PointF(15, 68), &amp;solidBrush);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the clipped strings.</p>

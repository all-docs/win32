<h1>Rotating, Reflecting, and Skewing Images</h1>
<p>You can rotate, reflect, and skew an image by specifying destination points for the upper-left, upper-right, and lower-left corners of the original image. The three destination points determine an affine transformation that maps the original rectangular image to a parallelogram. (The lower-right corner of the original image is mapped to the fourth corner of the parallelogram, which is calculated from the three specified destination points.)</p>
<p>For example, suppose the original image is a rectangle with upper-left corner at (0, 0), upper-right corner at (100, 0), and lower-left corner at (0, 50). Now suppose we map those three points to destination points as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Original point</th>
<th>Destination point</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Upper-left (0, 0)</td>
<td>(200, 20)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upper-right (100, 0)</td>
<td>(110, 100)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lower-left (0, 50)</td>
<td>(250, 30)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The following illustration shows the original image and the image mapped to the parallelogram. The original image has been skewed, reflected, rotated, and translated. The x-axis along the top edge of the original image is mapped to the line that runs through (200, 20) and (110, 100). The y-axis along the left edge of the original image is mapped to the line that runs through (200, 20) and (250, 30).</p>

<p>The following example produces the images shown in the preceding illustration.</p>
<pre><code>Point destinationPoints[] = {
   Point(200, 20),   // destination for upper-left point of original
   Point(110, 100),  // destination for upper-right point of original
   Point(250, 30)};  // destination for lower-left point of original
Image image(L&quot;Stripes.bmp&quot;);
// Draw the image unaltered with its upper-left corner at (0, 0).
graphics.DrawImage(&amp;image, 0, 0);
// Draw the image mapped to the parallelogram.
graphics.DrawImage(&amp;image, destinationPoints, 3); 
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows a similar transformation applied to a photographic image.</p>

<p>The following illustration shows a similar transformation applied to a metafile.</p>

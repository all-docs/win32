<h1>Drawing Cardinal Splines</h1>
<p>A cardinal spline is a curve that passes smoothly through a given set of points. To draw a cardinal spline, create a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> object and pass the address of an array of points to the <a href="/previous-versions//ms536070(v=vs.85)"><strong>Graphics::DrawCurve</strong></a> method. The following example draws a bell-shaped cardinal spline that passes through five designated points:</p>
<pre><code>Point points[] = {Point(0, 100),
                  Point(50, 80),
                  Point(100, 20),
                  Point(150, 80),
                  Point(200, 100)};

Pen pen(Color(255, 0, 0, 255));
graphics.DrawCurve(&amp;pen, points, 5);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the curve and five points.</p>
<p><img src="images/cardinalspline1.png" alt="illustration of a cardinal spline that passes through a set of five points" /></p>
<p>You can use the <a href="/previous-versions//ms536143(v=vs.85)"><strong>Graphics::DrawClosedCurve</strong></a> method of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> class to draw a closed cardinal spline. In a closed cardinal spline, the curve continues through the last point in the array and connects with the first point in the array.</p>
<p>The following example draws a closed cardinal spline that passes through six designated points.</p>
<pre><code>Point points[] = {Point(60, 60),
   Point(150, 80),
   Point(200, 40),
   Point(180, 120),
   Point(120, 100),
   Point(80, 160)};

Pen pen(Color(255, 0, 0, 255));
graphics.DrawClosedCurve(&amp;pen, points, 6);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the closed spline along with the six points:</p>

<p>You can change the way a cardinal spline bends by passing a tension argument to the <a href="/previous-versions//ms536070(v=vs.85)"><strong>Graphics::DrawCurve</strong></a> method. The following example draws three cardinal splines that pass through the same set of points:</p>
<pre><code>Point points[] = {Point(20, 50),
                  Point(100, 10),
                  Point(200, 100),
                  Point(300, 50),
                  Point(400, 80)};

Pen pen(Color(255, 0, 0, 255));
graphics.DrawCurve(&amp;pen, points, 5, 0.0f);  // tension 0.0
graphics.DrawCurve(&amp;pen, points, 5, 0.6f);  // tension 0.6
graphics.DrawCurve(&amp;pen, points, 5, 1.0f);  // tension 1.0
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the three splines along with their tension values. Note that when the tension is 0, the points are connected by straight lines.</p>

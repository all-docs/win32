<h1>Constructing and Drawing Paths</h1>
<p>A path is a sequence of graphics primitives (lines, rectangles, curves, text, and the like) that can be manipulated and drawn as a single unit. A path can be divided into <em>figures</em> that are either open or closed. A figure can contain several primitives.</p>
<p>You can draw a path by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-drawpath"><strong>Graphics::DrawPath</strong></a> method of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> class, and you can fill a path by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Gdiplusgraphics/nf-gdiplusgraphics-graphics-fillpath"><strong>Graphics::FillPath</strong></a> method of the <strong>Graphics</strong> class.</p>
<p>The following topics cover paths in more detail:</p>

<h1>Filling a Shape with a Color Gradient</h1>
<p>You can fill a shape with a gradually changing color by using a gradient brush. Windows GDI+ provides linear gradient brushes and path gradient brushes. The following illustration shows a rectangle filled with a linear gradient brush and an ellipse filled with a path gradient brush.</p>

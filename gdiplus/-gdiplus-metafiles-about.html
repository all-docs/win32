<h1>Metafiles (GDI+)</h1>
<p>Windows GDI+ provides the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-metafile"><strong>Metafile</strong></a> class so that you can record and display metafiles. A metafile, also called a vector image, is an image that is stored as a sequence of drawing commands and settings. The commands and settings recorded in a <strong>Metafile</strong> object can be stored in memory or saved to a file or stream.</p>
<p>GDI+ can display metafiles that have been stored in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Metafile Format (WMF)</li>
<li>Enhanced Metafile (EMF)</li>
<li>EMF+</li>
</ul>
<p>GDI+ can record metafiles in the EMF and EMF+ formats, but not in the WMF format.</p>
<p>EMF+ is an extension to EMF that allows GDI+ records to be stored. There are two variations on the EMF+ format: EMF+ Only and EMF+ Dual. EMF+ Only metafiles contain only GDI+ records. Such metafiles can be displayed by GDI+ but not by Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI). EMF+ Dual metafiles contain GDI+ and GDI records. Each GDI+ record in an EMF+ Dual metafile is paired with an alternate GDI record. Such metafiles can be displayed by GDI+ or by GDI.</p>
<p>The following example records one setting and one drawing command in a disk file. Note that the example creates a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> object and that the constructor for the <strong>Graphics</strong> object receives the address of a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-metafile"><strong>Metafile</strong></a> object as an argument.</p>
<pre><code>myMetafile = new Metafile(L&quot;MyDiskFile.emf&quot;, hdc);
myGraphics = new Graphics(myMetafile);
   myPen = new Pen(Color(255, 0, 0, 200));
   myGraphics-&gt;SetSmoothingMode(SmoothingModeAntiAlias);
   myGraphics-&gt;DrawLine(myPen, 0, 0, 60, 40);
delete myGraphics;
delete myPen;
delete myMetafile;
</code></pre>
<p>As the preceding example shows, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusgraphics/nl-gdiplusgraphics-graphics"><strong>Graphics</strong></a> class is the key to recording instructions and settings in a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-metafile"><strong>Metafile</strong></a> object. Any call made to a method of a <strong>Graphics</strong> object can be recorded in a <strong>Metafile</strong> object. Likewise, you can set any property of a <strong>Graphics</strong> object and record that setting in a <strong>Metafile</strong> object. The recording ends when the <strong>Graphics</strong> object is deleted or goes out of scope.</p>
<p>The following example displays the metafile created in the preceding example. The metafile is displayed with its upper-left corner at (100, 100).</p>
<pre><code>Graphics myGraphics(hdc);
Image myImage(L&quot;MyDiskFile.emf&quot;);
myGraphics.DrawImage(&amp;myImage, 100, 100);
</code></pre>
<p>The following example records several property settings (clipping region, world transformation, and smoothing mode) in a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/gdiplusheaders/nl-gdiplusheaders-metafile"><strong>Metafile</strong></a> object. Then the code records several drawing instructions. The instructions and settings are saved in a disk file.</p>
<pre><code>myMetafile = new Metafile(L&quot;MyDiskFile2.emf&quot;, hdc); 
myGraphics = new Graphics(myMetafile);
   myGraphics-&gt;SetSmoothingMode(SmoothingModeAntiAlias);
   myGraphics-&gt;RotateTransform(30);

   // Create an elliptical clipping region.
   GraphicsPath myPath;
   myPath.AddEllipse(0, 0, 200, 100);
   Region myRegion(&amp;myPath);
   myGraphics-&gt;SetClip(&amp;myRegion);

   Pen myPen(Color(255, 0, 0, 255));
   myGraphics-&gt;DrawPath(&amp;myPen, &amp;myPath);

   for(INT j = 0; j &lt;= 300; j += 10)
   {
      myGraphics-&gt;DrawLine(&amp;myPen, 0, 0, 300 - j, j);
   }
delete myGraphics;
delete myMetafile;
</code></pre>
<p>The following example displays the metafile image created in the preceding example.</p>
<pre><code>myGraphics = new Graphics(hdc);
myMetafile = new Metafile(L&quot;MyDiskFile.emf&quot;);
myGraphics-&gt;DrawImage(myMetafile, 10, 10);
</code></pre>
<p>The following illustration shows the output of the preceding code. Note the antialiasing, the elliptical clipping region, and the 30-degree rotation.</p>

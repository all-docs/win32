<h1>Image Frame Dimension Constants</h1>
<p>The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image file formats enable you to store multiple frames in a single image file. Multiple frames in a GIF file are used for animation, so the frames are said to be in the time dimension. Multiple frames in a TIFF file are typically used as separate pages, so the frames are said to be in the page dimension.</p>
<p>The following constants, defined in Gdiplusimaging.h, represent GUIDs that identify the page and time dimensions.</p>
<ul>
<li>FrameDimensionPage</li>
<li>FrameDimensionTime</li>
</ul>

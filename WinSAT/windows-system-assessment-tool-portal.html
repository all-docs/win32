<h1>Windows System Assessment Tool Provider</h1>
<p>[WinSAT may be altered or unavailable for releases after Windows 8.1.]</p>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Windows System Assessment Tool (WinSAT) exposes a number of classes that assesses the performance characteristics and capabilities of a computer. Developers can use this API to develop software that can access the performance and capability information of a computer to determine the optimal application settings based on that computer's performance capabilities.</p>
<p>Users can use the results of a formal assessment to determine which scenarios and applications will perform well on a computer. For example, if a software package contains a rating on its packaging, a user can use the rating to determine whether the software will run well on the computer.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>WinSAT is designed for C, C++, and Visual Basic developers and those who write scripts.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>WinSAT is available on client computers starting with the Windows Vista operating system.</p>

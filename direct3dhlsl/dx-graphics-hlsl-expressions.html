<h1>Expressions</h1>
<p>An expression is a sequence of <a href="dx-graphics-hlsl-variable-syntax.html">variables</a> and literals, punctuated by <a href="dx-graphics-hlsl-statement-blocks.html">operators</a>. A literal is an explicit data value, such as 1 for an integer or 2.1 for a floating-point number. Literals are often used to assign a value to a variable.</p>
<p>An expression followed by a semicolon (;) is called a statement. Statements range in complexity from simple expressions to blocks of statements that accomplish a sequence of actions. Flow-control statements determine the order statements are executed.</p>
<p>A statement block also indicates subscope. Variables declared within a statement block are only recognized within the block. HLSL statements determine the order in which expressions are evaluated. Each expression can be one of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>An expression</li>
<li>A <a href="dx-graphics-hlsl-statement-blocks.html">statement block</a></li>
<li>A <a href="dx-graphics-hlsl-return.html">return statement</a></li>
<li>A <a href="dx-graphics-hlsl-flow-control.html">flow-control statement</a></li>
</ul>

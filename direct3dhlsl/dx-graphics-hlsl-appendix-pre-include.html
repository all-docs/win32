<h1>#include Directive</h1>
<p>Preprocessor directive that inserts the contents of the specified file into the source program at the point where the directive appears.</p>

<tr>
<td><em>filename</em></td>
<td>Filename of the file to include, optionally preceded by a directory specification. The filename must specify an existing file.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The #include directive causes replacement of the directive by the entire contents of the specified file. The preprocessor stops searching as soon as it finds a file with the specified name; if you specify a complete, unambiguous path specification for the file, the preprocessor searches only the specified path.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
The <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dtools/fxc">Effect-Compiler Tool</a> has a built-in include handler using the /I switch. However, when executing the compiler from the API, you can provide a customized include handler by implementing the ID3DXInclude interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between the two syntax forms is the order in which the preprocessor searches for header files when the path is incompletely specified, as shown in the following table.</p>

The INCLUDE environment variable is ignored in an development environment. Refer to your development environment's documentation for information about how to set the include paths for your project.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following example causes the preprocessor to replace the #include directive with the contents of stdio.h. Because the example uses the angle bracket format, the preprocessor will search for the file only in the directories listed by the /I compiler option and the INCLUDE environment variable.</p>
<pre lang="cpp"><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</code></pre>

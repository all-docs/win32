<h1>Temporary Register (HLSL VS reference)</h1>
<p>A vertex shader temporary register is used to hold intermediate results.</p>
<p>A temporary register must be initialized before it is used. Each temporary register has single-write and triple-read access. This means that a single shader instruction can use as many as three temporary registers as inputs.</p>
<p>Values in a temporary register that remain from preceding invocations of the vertex shader cannot be used.</p>
<p>A register consists of properties that determine how each register behaves.</p>

<p>Each temporary register has single-write and triple-read access. Therefore, an instruction can have as many as three temporary registers in its set of input source operands.</p>
<p>No values in a temporary register that remain from preceding invocations of the vertex shader can be used. Vertex shaders that read a value from a temporary register before writing to it will fail the Direct3D API call to create the vertex shader.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here is an example using a temporary register:</p>
<pre><code>def c4, 0,0,0,1
...
// Decompress position
mov r0.x, v0.x
mov r0.y, c4.w       // 1
mov r0.z, v0.y
mov r0.w, c4.w       // 1

// Compute theta from distance and time
mov r4.xz, r0        // xz
</code></pre>

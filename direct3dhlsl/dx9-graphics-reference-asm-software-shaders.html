<p>Some validations are relaxed for software shaders. This is useful for debugging and prototyping purposes. The following validations are relaxed: (all other validations remain the same)</p>

<th>Validation type</th>
<th>Relaxation</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Instruction Counts:</td>
<td>This is relaxed for vs_2_sw, vs_3_sw and ps_2_sw, ps_3_sw. Unlimited instructions are allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Float Constant Counts:</td>
<td>This is relaxed for vs_2_sw, vs_3_sw and ps_2_sw, ps_3_sw. Up to 8192 constants are allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Integer Constant Counts:</td>
<td>This is relaxed for vs_2_sw, vs_3_sw and ps_2_sw, ps_3_sw. Up to 2048 constants are allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Boolean Constant Counts:</td>
<td>This is relaxed for vs_2_sw, vs_3_sw and ps_2_sw, ps_3_sw. Up to 2048 constants are allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dependent-read depth:</td>
<td>This is relaxed for ps_2_sw. Like in vs_3_0 and ps_3_0, unlimited dependent reads are allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of flow control instructions and labels:</td>
<td>This is relaxed for vs_2_sw. Unlimited flow control instructions and upto 2048 labels are allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Loop count/start/step:</td>
<td>These are relaxed for vs_2_sw, vs_3_sw, ps_2_sw and ps_3_sw. Iteration start and interation step size for rep and loop instructions are 32-bit signed intergers. Interation count can be up to MAX_INT/64.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Read-port limits:</td>
<td>vs_2_sw, vs_3_sw, ps_2_sw and ps_3_sw have no read-port limit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of interpolators:</td>
<td>There are 16 <a href="dx9-graphics-reference-asm-vs-registers-vs-3-0.html">Registers - vs_3_0</a> (o#) in vs_3_sw and 10 <a href="dx9-graphics-reference-asm-ps-registers-ps-3-0.html">ps_3_0 Registers</a> (v#) for ps_3_sw.</td>

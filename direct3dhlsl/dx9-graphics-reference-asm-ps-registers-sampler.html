<h1>Sampler (Direct3D 9 asm-ps)</h1>
<p>A sampler is a input pseudo-register for a pixel shader, which is used to identify the sampling stage. There are 16 pixel shader sampling stage registers: s0 to s15. Therefore, up to 16 texture surfaces can be read in a single shader pass. The instructions that use a sampler register are texld and texldp.</p>
<p>Sampler must be declared before use with the <a href="dcl-samplertype---ps.html">dcl_samplerType (sm2, sm3 - ps asm)</a> instruction.</p>

<p>Samplers are pseudo registers because you cannot directly read or write to them.</p>
<p>A sampling unit corresponds to the texture sampling stage, encapsulating the sampling-specific state provided by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-setsamplerstate"><strong>SetSamplerState</strong></a>. Each sampler uniquely identifies a single texture surface, which is set to the corresponding sampler using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-settexture"><strong>SetTexture</strong></a>. However, the same texture surface can be set at multiple samplers.</p>
<p>At draw time, a texture cannot be simultaneously set as a render target and a texture at a stage.</p>
<p>A sampler might appear as the only argument in the texture load instruction: <a href="texldl---ps.html">texldl - ps</a>.</p>
<p>In ps_3_0, if a sampler is used, it needs to be declared at the beginning of the shader program using the <a href="dcl-samplertype---ps.html">dcl_samplerType (sm2, sm3 - ps asm)</a> instruction.</p>
<p>Sampling a texture with a higher dimension than is present in the texture coordinates is illegal. Sampling a texture with a lower dimension than is present in the texture coordinates will ignore the extra texture coordinates.</p>

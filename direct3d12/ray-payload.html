<h1>Ray payload structure</h1>
<p>A user-defined structure that is provided as an inout argument in a <a href="traceray-function.html"><strong>TraceRay</strong></a> call, and as an inout parameter in the shader types that may access the ray payload, which include <a href="any-hit-shader.html">any hit</a>, <a href="closest-hit-shader.html">closest hit</a>, and <a href="miss-shader.html">miss</a> shaders. Any shaders that access the ray payload must use the same structure as the one provided at the originating <strong>TraceRay</strong> call.  Even if one of these shaders doesnâ€™t reference the ray payload at all, it still must specify the matching payload as the originating <strong>TraceRay</strong> call.</p>

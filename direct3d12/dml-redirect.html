<h1>Direct Machine Learning (DirectML)</h1>
<p>Direct Machine Learning (DirectML) is a low-level API for machine learning. It has a familiar (native C++, nano-COM) programming interface and workflow in the style of DirectX 12. You can integrate machine learning inferencing workloads into your game, engine, middleware, backend, or other application. DirectML is supported by all DirectX 12-compatible hardware.</p>
<p>DirectML is introduced in Windows 10, version 1903, and in the corresponding version of the Windows SDK.</p>

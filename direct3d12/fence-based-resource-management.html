<h2>Ring buffer scenario</h2>
<p>The following is an example in which an app experiences a rare demand for upload heap memory.</p>
<p>A ring buffer is one way to manage an upload heap. The ring buffer holds data required for the next few frames. The app maintains a current data input pointer, and a frame offset queue to record each frame and starting offset of resource data for that frame.</p>
<p>An app creates a ring-buffer based upon a buffer to upload data to the GPU for each frame. Currently frame 2 has been rendered, the ring buffer wraps around the data for frame 4, all the data required for frame 5 is present, and a large constant buffer required for frame 6 needs to be sub-allocated.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> : the app tries to sub-allocate for the constant buffer, but finds insufficient free memory.</p>
<p><img src="images/ring-buffer-1.png" alt="insufficient free memory in this ring buffer" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> : through fence polling, the app discovers that frame 3 has been rendered, the frame offset queue is then updated, and the current state of the ring buffer follows - however, free memory is still not large enough to accommodate the constant buffer.</p>
<p><img src="images/ring-buffer-2.png" alt="still insufficient memory after frame 3 has rendered" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong> : given the situation, the CPU blocks itself (via fence waiting) until frame 4 has been rendered, which frees up the memory sub-allocated for frame 4.</p>
<p><img src="images/ring-buffer-3.png" alt="rendering frame 4 frees up more of the ring buffer" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 4</strong> : now free memory is large enough for the constant buffer, and sub-allocation succeeds; the app copies the big constant buffer data to memory previously used by resource data for both frames 3 and 4. The current input pointer is finally updated.</p>
<p><img src="images/ring-buffer-4.png" alt="now there is room from frame 6 in the ring buffer" /></p>
<p>If an app implements a ring buffer, the ring buffer must be large enough to cope with the worse-case scenario of the sizes of resource data.</p>
<h2>Ring buffer sample</h2>
<p>The following sample code shows how a ring buffer can be managed, paying attention to the sub-allocation routine that handles fence polling and waiting. For simplicity, the sample uses NOT_SUFFICIENT_MEMORY to hide the details of â€œnot sufficient free memory found in the heapâ€ since that logic (based on <em>m_pDataCur</em> and offsets inside <em>FrameOffsetQueue</em>) is not tightly related to heaps or fences. The sample is simplified to sacrifice frame rate instead of memory utilization.</p>
<p>Note that, ring-buffer support is expected to be a popular scenario; however, the heap design does not preclude other usage, such as command list parameterization and re-use.</p>

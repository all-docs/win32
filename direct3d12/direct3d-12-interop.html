<td>D3D11On12 is a mechanism by which developers can use D3D11 interfaces and objects to drive the D3D12 API. D3D11on12 enables components written using D3D11 (for example, D2D text and UI) to work together with components written targeting the D3D12 API. D3D11on12 also enables incremental porting of an application from D3D11 to D3D12, by enabling portions of the app to continue targeting D3D11 for simplicity while others target D3D12 for performance, while always having complete and correct rendering. D3D11On12 makes it simpler than using interop techniques to share resources and synchronize work between the two APIs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<h1>Memory Management in Direct3D 12</h1>
<p>Moving to D3D12 involves doing proper synchronization and management of memory residency. Managing memory residency means even more synchronization must be done. This section covers memory management strategies, and suballocation within heaps and buffers.</p>

<td>A memory manager for Direct3D 12 could get very complicated quickly with all the different tiers of support, for UMA or discrete (non-UMA) adapters, and with a considerable range of architecture differences between GPU adapters.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The recommended strategy for Direct3D 12 memory management , described in this section, is &quot;classify, budget and stream&quot;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<td>Buffers have all the features necessary in D3D12 for applications to transfer a large range of transient data from the CPU to the GPU. This section covers four common scenarios for the use and management of resources and buffers.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<h1>Counters, queries, and predication</h1>
<p>This topic covers stream-output counters, UAV counters, queries, and predication.</p>
<p>Stream output and UAV counters operate in Direct3D 12 in a similar method to Direct3D 11, although now memory for the counters must be allocated by the app, the driver does not do it. Queries in Direct3D 12 are more different from those in Direct3D 11, with the addition of fences and other processes that remove the need for some query types.</p>

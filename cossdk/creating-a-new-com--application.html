<h1>Creating a New COM+ Application</h1>
<p>Creating a new COM+ application requires two basic steps, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating an empty COM+ application (described below).</li>
<li>Adding components to the application. (See <a href="installing-new-components.html">Installing New Components</a> and <a href="importing-components.html">Importing Components</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To create an empty COM+ application</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool, select the computer on which you want to create an application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder for that computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Action</strong> menu, point to <strong>New</strong>, and then click <strong>Application</strong>. You can also right-click the <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder, point to <strong>New</strong>, and then click <strong>Application</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Welcome</strong> page of the COM+ Application Install Wizard, click <strong>Next</strong>, and then in the <strong>Install or Create a New Application</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Create an empty application</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the box provided, type a name for the new application. (Note that the following special characters cannot be used in an application name: \, /, ~, !, @, #, %, ^, &amp;, *, (, ), |, }, {, ], [, ', &quot;, &gt;, &lt;, ., ?, :, and ;.) Under <strong>Activation type</strong>, click <strong>Library application</strong> or <strong>Server application</strong>. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
A server application runs in its own process. Server applications can support all COM+ services. A library application runs in the process of the client that creates it. Library applications can use role-based security but do not support remote access or queued components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Set Application Identity</strong> dialog box, choose an identity under which the application will run. If you select <strong>This user</strong>, type the user name and password. You must also retype the password in the <strong>Confirm password</strong> box. Click <strong>Next</strong>. (The default selection for application identity is <strong>Interactive User</strong>. The interactive user is the user logged on to the server computer at any given time. You can select a different user by selecting <strong>This user</strong> and entering a specific user or group.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The <strong>Set Application Identity</strong> dialog box appears only if you selected <strong>Server application</strong> for the new application's activation type in the COM Application Install Wizard's preceding dialog box. The identity property is not used for library applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Add Application Roles</strong> dialog box, add any roles you want to associate with the application. By default, only the <strong>CreatorOwner</strong> role is defined. For information on roles, see <a href="role-based-security-administration.html">Role-Based Security Administration</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Add Users to Roles</strong> dialog box, populate each role you created in the last step with the users, groups, or built-in security principals to which you want to grant the privileges associated with that role. By default, the interactive user is placed in the <strong>CreatorOwner</strong> role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The new application will now be displayed under the <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder in the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
As of Windows ServerÂ 2003, access checks are enabled by default when creating a COM+ application. In previous versions, access checks were disabled by default at the application level. The result is that by default, access to a COM+ application is allowed only to users that are in the roles associated with the application. (See <a href="role-based-security-administration.html">Role-Based Security Administration</a>.) Alternatively, you can allow access to all users by disabling access checks on a COM+ application. (See <a href="enabling-access-checks-for-an-application.html">Enabling Access Checks for an Application</a>.)</p>

<h1>Security Limitations in Workgroup Mode</h1>
<p>The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms711472(v=vs.85)">Message Queuing</a> workgroup configuration does not permit the COM+ queued components service to support application security. If you've installed Message Queuing with the workgroup configuration, you must <a href="specifying-the-authentication-protocol.html">disable security</a> on each queued application accessed in this configuration by selecting <strong>Do not authenticate messages</strong> on the <strong>Queuing</strong> tab for the COM+ application's <strong>Properties</strong> dialog, using the Component Services administrative tool. This should be done only on a trusted network and must be done at both client and server if the application has already been exported.</p>

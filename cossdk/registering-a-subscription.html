<h1>Registering a Subscription</h1>
<p>After you have registered an event class in the COM+ catalog, you can add subscribers to the event class and subscriptions to the subscribers. Subscriptions can subscribe to a single method or to all the methods of an interface. To receive calls on more than one methodâ€”but not to every methodâ€”of an interface, you must add a subscription for each method to which you want to receive a call. The Component Services administration tool can search the COM+ catalog for registered event classes that support the interfaces implemented by the subscriber and offers you the choice to subscribe. Choose the publisher that offers you the desired events.</p>
<p>To add subscribers to the subscriber component, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After creating a new COM+ application and installing the subscriber component, right-click the <strong>Subscriptions</strong> folder to enable the COM+ New Subscription Wizard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the event class from which you want to receive events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a name for the subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable the subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When a publisher application wants to fire an event, the publisher instantiates the event class object and calls a method on it. COM+ searches the COM+ catalog to find all the subscribers. It creates the subscriber object (directly, queued, or with a moniker) and passes on the method call originally made by the publisher.</p>

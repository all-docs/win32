<h1>Pooled Resource States Available to COM+ Resource Dispenser</h1>
<p>At any one time, a resource is either in use or not in use and is either enlisted or not enlisted in a transaction. This yields four possible resource states, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Resources in unenlisted inventory.</strong> A resource that is not in use by an object and not enlisted in a transaction is in unenlisted inventory. A resource in general inventory is available for assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resources in enlisted inventory.</strong> A resource that is not in use by an object but is enlisted in a transaction is in enlisted inventory. Such a resource is available for assignment only to objects running in the same transaction. A resource moves from enlisted inventory to unenlisted inventory when COM+ notifies the dispenser manager that the transaction is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resources in unenlisted use.</strong> If a resource is assigned to an object and the instance is not running in a transaction or the resource dispenser has identified the resource as non-transactional, this resource is in unenlisted use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resources in enlisted use.</strong> If a resource is assigned to an object, the instance is running in a transaction, and the resource dispenser has successfully enlisted the resource in the transaction, this resource is in enlisted use.</p>
</li>
</ul>

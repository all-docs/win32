<h1>Managing Automatic Transactions in COM+</h1>
<p>In the COM+ programming model, you can design your components to do what they do bestâ€”enabling business logic or establishing a database connectionâ€”and rely on the transaction processing framework of Microsoft Windows to automate transactions.</p>
<h2>Starting a Transaction</h2>
<p>COM+ automatically begins a transaction when it encounters either of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a non-transactional client calls a component that requires a transaction or requires a new transaction.</li>
<li>When a transactional client calls a component that requires a new transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>If COM+ determines that an object should have a new transaction, it begins the transaction first and then places the object in it. The process includes the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>COM+ creates a context object, sets both the <a href="com--just-in-time-activation.html">JIT activation</a> and <a href="com--synchronization.html">Synchronization</a> attributes to Required, and sets the <a href="consistent-and-done-flags.html">consistent and done flags</a> to True and False, respectively.</li>
<li>COM+ communicates with the Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) to begin a transaction. The DTC coordinates the physical transaction.</li>
<li>The DTC generates a transaction identifier and passes it back to COM+. The transaction identifier establishes a transaction boundary. All objects participating in the transaction share the same identifier.</li>
<li>When the client creates the object, COM+ activates it within the transaction boundary.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Ending a Transaction</h2>
<p>COM+ ends an automatic transaction by committing or aborting it when one of the following conditions occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The root object of the transaction completes its work and COM+ releases it. After the root object deactivates, the transaction attempts to commit.</li>
<li>The client releases the root object. Without a reference, the root object deactivates and the transaction attempts to commit.</li>
<li>The transaction exceeds its time-out threshold. The transaction aborts automatically if not committed within the transaction time-out period, deactivating all objects associated with the transaction. The default transaction time-out period is 60 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Application Design Restrictions</h1>
<p>Some applications are designed in a way that prevents multiple instances of the application from being installed on a computer. With such a limitation, an application cannot make use of the partitions feature. The following application design features might need to be modified before partitions can be used for that application.</p>
<h2>Tables and Arrays</h2>
<p>Some applications create database tables, in-memory tables, or arrays that use a CLSID as a unique registry key. On a computer without partitions, this registry key is typically computer/CLSID (one CLSID per computer).</p>
<p>Conversely, on a computer with partitions, this registry key is computer/partition ID/application ID/CLSID (multiple instances of a CLSID per computer). Because the partitions feature allows multiple instances of a CLSID to exist on a computer, applications that contain design elements that require a unique CLSID per computer might be adversely affected.</p>
<h2>Global Resources</h2>
<p>Some applications use global resources such as shared memory, data files, and registry entries. This could cause problems if multiple instances of such an application are executing simultaneously.</p>
<p>For example, if a component uses shared memory for interacting with other components, the component will need to be modified so that each instance of the component allocates its own shared memory.</p>
<h2>Type Libraries</h2>
<p>Type libraries provide information about a component's interfaces and methods. This information is used for several purposes, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marshaling data between components when function calls are made</li>
<li>Helping the COM+ Queued Components and COM+ Events services</li>
<li>Providing the correct information within a Microsoft Visual Basic editor</li>
</ul>
<p>References to a type library are installed in the registry of a computer. When developing applications that will be invoked from within partitions, it is important that the latest version of a type library is installed in the registry. This ensures that the Visual Basic editor being used will get accurate information about the methods available for that component.</p>

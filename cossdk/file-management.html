<p>To enable the transfer of application files, COMREPL automatically manages sets of file system folders on the source and target. These COMREPL folders are all rooted in %systemdir%\com\replication.</p>
<h2>Source folders</h2>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ReplicaSource<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Applications exported during the prepare phase are stored here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This folder is overwritten each time the prepare phase is executed against a given source computer. This folder is never explicitly deleted, so replication to targets can take place at any time after the source is prepared.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Each application is stored in its own subfolder named &lt;appName&gt;+&lt;appID&gt;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<h2>Target folders</h2>

<td>ReplicaNew<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The copy phase copies all files and subfolders from ReplicaSource on the source to ReplicaNew on the target. Any previous contents of ReplicaNew are deleted each time the copy phase is run against a given target.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> This folder exists only while the replication process is running.

<tr>
<td>ReplicaCurrent<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The replicated applications currently installed on the target are stored here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> When the install phase is started, the ReplicaNew folder is renamed to ReplicaCurrent.

<h1>Exporting a SOAP-Enabled Application</h1>
<p>When you use COM+ to create an XML web service, that service can be used by any authorized client, including those not using COM+ or even Microsoft Windows. However, using a COM+ web service in client-activated object (CAO) mode from a COM+ client application is especially easy. Just export the SOAP-enabled application in proxy mode, and then <a href="importing-a-soap-enabled-application.html">import</a> it into the client for which you want to access the corresponding XML web service.</p>
<h2>Component Services Administrative Tool</h2>
<p>To export a SOAP-enabled application from a server, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool, under <strong>Component Services</strong>, open the <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder associated with the computer you want to manage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click the component you want to expose as an XML web service, and choose <strong>Export</strong>. The <strong>COM+ Application Export Wizard</strong> appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the text box labeled <strong>Enter the full path and filename for the application file to be created</strong>, enter the full path and filename for the MSI file that will contain the exported application, or click <strong>Browse</strong> to select the full path and filename using a dialog box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under <strong>Export As</strong>, select the <strong>Application Proxy â€“ Install on other machines to enable access to this machine</strong> radio button.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Monitoring Object Statistics</h1>
<p>You can monitor object statistics as an application runs. By doing so, you can fine-tune the object pool characteristics to achieve the balance in performance and resources that you would like to have.</p>
<p>You can monitor status for any objects that are configured to support object statistics and event reporting. Enabling object statistics has a very slight performance overhead.</p>
<p><strong>To enable object statistics</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the details pane of the Component Services administrative tool, right-click the component that you want to configure and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the component properties dialog box, click the <strong>Activation</strong> tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enable object statistics for the component, under <strong>Activation Context</strong>, select the <strong>Component supports events and statistics</strong> check box.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To monitor object status</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool, open the folder for the application that includes the components you want to monitor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click the <strong>Components</strong> folder, point to <strong>View</strong>, and then click <strong>Status View</strong>. The details pane now displays the status view for all components in the application. The following table describes the six columns in the status view.</p>

<h1>COM+ Queued Components Concepts</h1>
<p>Based on <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms711472(v=vs.85)">Message Queuing</a> services, the COM+ queued components service provides an easy way to invoke and execute components asynchronously. Processing can occur without regard to the availability or accessibility of either the sender or the receiver.</p>
<p>In COM terms, a <em>queue</em> is a storage area that saves messages for later retrieval. Queuing provides a mechanism for connectionless communication. That is, the sender and receiver are not connected directly and communicate only through queues. Queuing provides a way to hold the information until the receiver is ready to obtain it. The sender and receiver are indirectly communicating so that each can operate independently, unaffected by the other.</p>
<p>In the past, an in-depth knowledge of marshaling was necessary to queue, send, and receive asynchronous messages. Now, using method calls that are easily understood and used by component developers, the COM+ queued components service automatically marshals data in the form of a Message Queuing message. And because the queued components service offers built-in support for transactions, an inconsistent state cannot compromise data if a server failure occurs.</p>
<p>The following topics in this section contain background information about designing and writing queued components.</p>

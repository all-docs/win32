<h1>Registering an Event Class</h1>
<p>So that subscribers can find an event class and subscribe to it, event classes must be registered in the COM+ catalog. COM+ requires a type library that describes the event interfaces and methods so that it can properly match and connect subscribers and publishers. The type library must reside in or be accompanied by a self-registering DLL.</p>
<p>You can use the Component Services administrative tool or the COM+ Administrative functions to register an event class in the COM+ catalog.</p>
<p><strong>To register an event class with the Component Services administrative tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a new COM+ application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the application folder and select <strong>Components</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>Action</strong> menu, click <strong>New</strong>. (You can also select the <strong>Components</strong> folder, right-click, point to <strong>New</strong>, and then click <strong>Component</strong>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Install new event class(es)</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter the path to the event class component DLL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The event class is registered in the COM+ catalog and can be located by subscribers interested in obtaining the information provided by the event class. For information about how to register the event class by using the COM+ administrative interfaces, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComAdmin/nf-comadmin-icomadmincatalog-installeventclass"><strong>ICOMAdminCatalog::InstallEventClass</strong></a>.</p>

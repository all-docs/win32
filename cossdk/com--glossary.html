<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>access token</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An object that describes the security context of a process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by comparing it with information stored in a security database. If the password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>ACID properties</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Acronym coined by transaction processing pioneers for atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. These properties ensure predictable behavior, reinforcing the role of transactions as all-or-none propositions designed to provide consistent and predictable results in a distributed environment when independent failures can occur.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>activation</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The chain of events that results in the creation of a COM object and the return of a valid pointer to an interface on that object. In COM+, an object gets activated either in its own context or in that of its creator (an object that has requested the object being activated). COM+ services rely on appropriate activation of an object based on the object's configuration. In the course of activation, the system determines the context in which the object runs, initializes the context properties, checks access permissions, and establishes a security identity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>activation security</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A form of security protection that determines who can launch a server. Activation security is automatically applied by the Service Control Manager (SCM) of a particular computer. Upon receipt of a request from a client to activate an object, the SCM checks the request against activation-security information stored within its registry. Activation security is also checked for same-computer activations. Also called <em>launch security</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>activation type</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Activation category for a COM+ application that indicates whether the application runs in or out of its client's process space (depending on whether it's a library or server application, respectively) as well as whether the application runs as a service.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>activity</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In COM+, a logical thread comprising one or more transactions and containing a collection of components that are grouped into a COM+ application. Every COM object belongs to one activity. The association between an object and an activity cannot be changed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>apartment model process</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A process that has two or more single-threaded apartments and no multithreaded apartments.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>application proxy</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A set of files containing registration information that allows a client to remotely access a COM+ server application. When installed on a client computer, an application proxy file writes information about the server application to the client computer; the client can then remotely access the server application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>authentication</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The security process of determining that a caller of an application is actually who it says it isâ€”verifying the authenticity of an identity claim. For COM+ applications, authentication can be turned on and configured administratively, after which it works transparently to the application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>authorization</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The security process of determining whether a caller of an application is authorized to do what it is asking to do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>caching resource manager</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A resource manager that acts as a front-end to another resource manager and that caches information locally, reducing the cost of accessing the underlying resource. Unlike a conventional resource manager, a caching resource manager does not participate in recovery because it never permanently stores the underlying data.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>call security</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A form of security protection that helps control access to a server object's methods after a server has been launched.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>class (COM)</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A named, concrete implementation of one or more interfaces. A COM class is identified by a CLSID and, sometimes, a ProgID.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>cloaking</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A server's ability to mask its own identity when making calls on a client's behalf. When cloaking is enabled, calls made by the server impersonating the client can be made under the client's identity. When cloaking is disabled, calls by the server will be made under the server's identity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ application</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The primary unit of administration and security for Component Services. A COM+ application is a group of COM components that, generally, perform related functions. These components further consist of COM interfaces and methods.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ Application Pooling</strong></p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ Application Recycling</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ catalog</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The data store that holds COM+ configuration data. Performance of COM+ administration tasks requires reading and writing data stored in the catalog. The catalog can be accessed only through the Component Services administrative tool or through the COMAdmin library.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ Events</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>COM+ Events matches and connects publishers and subscribers through a loosely coupled events system. A publisher makes the method call to initiate an event, and a subscriber receives these calls through the event system rather than directly from the publisher. The COM+ Events service maintains the list of interested subscribers who receive the calls and directs those calls without requiring the knowledge of the publisher.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ library application</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM+ application that runs in the process of the client that creates it. Library applications can use role-based security but do not support remote access or queued components.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ Object Pooling</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An automatic service provided by COM+ that enables you to configure a component to have instances of itself kept active in a pool, ready to be used by any client that requests the component.</p>

<p>A group of COM+ partitions that is mapped to a particular user ID in Active Directory.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ Queued Components</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM+ service, based on Microsoft Message Queuing, that provides an easy way to invoke and execute components asynchronously. Message processing can occur without regard to the availability or accessibility of either the sender or the receiver.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ server application</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM+ application that runs in its own process. Server applications can support all COM+ services.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM+ SOAP</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A Component Services feature that allows you to expose a COM+ application as an XML web service. COM+ SOAP also enables you to use an XML web service as a COM component.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM component</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A binary unit of code that includes packaging and registration code and that creates COM objects. All COM+ applications consist of one or more COM components.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>commit tree</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In a distributed transaction system, the conceptual representation of a transaction as based on the hierarchical relationships between individual transaction managers participating in a distributed transaction. Included in that hierarchy are the enlisted resource managers associated with the transaction managers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>COM object</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the COM programming model, a programming structure encapsulating both data and functionality, which are defined and allocated as a single unit and for which the only public access is through the programming structure's interfaces. A COM object must support, at a minimum, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iunknown"><strong>IUnknown</strong></a> interface, which maintains the object's existence while it is being used and provides access to the object's other interfaces.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Compensating Resource Manager (CRM)</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM+ feature that enables non-transactional resources to participate in a two-phase commit transaction with the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC). Typically, CRMs do not provide the isolation capabilities of full resource managers, but they do provide transactional atomicity and durability by writing to a log.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Component Services administrative tool</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A user-interface snap-in through which administrators and developers can create, configure, and maintain COM+ applications, as well as administer distributed transactions and memory-resident databases. The Component Services administrative tool can also be used to view system events and manage system services local to the computer on which the tool is installed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>conceptual model</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The first step in the COM+ application design phase, where the developer defines the business problems to be solved and decides what components and services are required.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>concurrency</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ability of more than one transaction or process to access the same data at the same time. COM+ generally manages concurrency through synchronization.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>configured component</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM component that has been installed into a COM+ application. After it is installed, the component is configured within the COM+ catalog to make use of the available COM+ services.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>context</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A set of run-time properties associated with one or more COM objects that are used to provide services for those objects. Every COM object runs in a single context from activation to deactivation (always within the same apartment). Initialized when an object is activated, context properties, such as security context properties, represent the run-time needs of an object.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>data tier</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the three-tier architecture model for business applications, the DBMS access layer, which can be accessed through the middle tier, or business services layer, and on occasion through the presentation tier, or user services layer. The data tier consists of data access components (rather than raw DBMS connections) to aid in resource sharing and to allow clients to be configured without installing the DBMS libraries and ODBC drivers on each client. Also called <em>data services layer</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>deadlock</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In multithreaded applications, a threading problem that occurs when each member of a set of threads is waiting for another member of the set.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>delegation</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A form of impersonation that authorizes a server to act on a client's behalf, giving the server the ability to impersonate clients over the network.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>distributed transaction</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A transaction that involves multiple resource managers, which can be on the same or different computers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC)</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A system service that manages transactions and transaction-related communications that are distributed across two or more resource managers on one or more systems to ensure correct ACID transactions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>dynamic cloaking</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A form of cloaking where the original client identity is discovered as the server thread access token on each method call to the downstream server. Although the identity that is presented can be determined dynamically, the overhead required to do this can be considerably more expensive. For COM+ applications, the default configuration is for dynamic cloaking capability because it provides the flexibility that is usually required by circumstances that necessitate using impersonation in the first place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>enumerator object</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Enables enumeration of items in a collection.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>event method</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A method in a COM+ interface that identifies a COM+ event. Event methods must be uniquely named and can contain only input parameters. The return value must be an <strong>HRESULT</strong>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>event object</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM object that can signal one or more threads that an event has occurred. Any thread within a process can create an event object.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>exception</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An abnormal condition or error that occurs during the execution of a program and that requires the execution of software outside the normal flow of control.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>failover</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In a cluster network system, the process of relocating an overloaded or failed resourceâ€”such as a server, a disk drive, or a networkâ€”to its backup component.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A process that has a multithreaded apartment and no single-threaded apartments.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>global commit coordinator</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On a Microsoft Windowsâ€“based distributed transaction system, the root transaction manager of the commit tree. This coordinator makes the decision to either commit or abort a given transaction and is never in doubt.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>impersonation</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The ability of a thread to execute in a security context different from that of the process owning the thread. The server thread uses an access token representing the client's credentials, and with this, it can access resources that the client can access.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>impersonation level</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The setting used by the client to grant the server a particular level of authority to carry out actions on the client's behalf. In COM+, this can be set only for COM+ server applications.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>interception</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For an object activated in a given context, the process of handling calls to that object from across the context boundary. Calls across context are handled with lightweight interface proxies that will handle whatever mediation is required to adjust the run-time environment from one that accommodates the caller to one that accommodates the callee.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>interface</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In COM-based programming, a collection of related public functions that provide access to a COM object. The set of interfaces on a COM object composes a contract that specifies how programs and other objects can interact with the COM object.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>interface proxy</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An interface-specific object that packages (marshals) parameters for that interface in preparation for a remote method call and unpackages (unmarshals) the return values from the interface stub. A proxy runs in the address space of the sender and communicates with a corresponding stub in the receiver's address space.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>interface stub</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An interface-specific object that unpackages marshaled parameters, calls the required method, and packages (marshals) return values from the called method. The stub runs in the receiver's address space and communicates with a corresponding interface proxy in the sender's address space.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>interior object</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In a transactional hierarchy, any object under the root object.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>just-in-time (JIT) activation</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An automatic service provided by COM+ that allows idle server resources to be used more productively. When a component is configured as JIT activated, COM+ can deactivate an instance of it while a client still holds an active reference to the object. The next time the client calls a method on the object, COM+ will reactivate the object transparently to the client, just in time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>legacy component</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An unconfigured component that has been installed into a COM+ application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>listener</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An architectural element of the COM+ Queued Components service. The listener is a COM object that opens the message queue associated with its host application and waits for messages to arrive. As messages arrive, the listener dispatches threads that process messages.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>logical model</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The second step in a COM+ application design process, where the conceptual model is broken out into the logical tiers of the three-tier architecture, as follows: the presentation tier, or user services; the middle tier, or business services; and the data tier, or data services.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>loosely coupled event</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An event whose sender (publisher) and receiver (subscriber) are not closely bound. In a loosely coupled event system, such as COM+ Events, event information from different publishers is persisted in an event store. Subscribers query this store and select the events that they want to receive. Selecting event information from the event store creates a subscription. When an event occurs, the event system looks in this database and finds the interested subscribers, creates a new object of each interested class, and calls a method on that object.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>marshaling</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The process of packaging and unpackaging interface method parameters across thread or process boundaries so that a remote procedure call can take place.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>message mover</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The architectural element of the COM+ Queued Components service that moves failed messages back to their input queue so that they can be retried.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>meta-event</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A type of event used by the COM+ Events system to notify interested subscribers whenever event class objects or subscriptions are created, modified, or removed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>method</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In COM-based programming, a process performed by a COM object when it receives a message.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>middle tier</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the three-tier architecture model for business applications, the layer comprising the business logic and data rules. The components that make up the middle tier can be used to enforce business rules, such as business algorithms, legal or governmental regulations, and data rules, which are designed to keep the data structures consistent within either specific or multiple databases. Because these middle-tier components are not tied to a specific client, they can be used by all applications and can be moved to different locations as response time and other rules require. Also called <em>business services layer</em> or <em>business logic tier</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>mixed model process</strong></p>

<p>A process that has a multithreaded apartment and one or more single-threaded apartments.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>moniker</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A name that uniquely identifies a COM object. In the same way that a path identifies a file in the file system, a moniker identifies a COM object in the directory namespace.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>.msi file</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A file created by the Component Services administrative tool when you export a COM+ application or application proxy for installation on another computer. The .msi file can be installed on any Windows-based client using Windows Installer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>multithreaded apartment model</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An apartment model in which all the threads in the process that have been initialized as free-threaded reside in a single apartment. Therefore, there is no need to marshal between threads. The threads need not retrieve and dispatch messages because COM does not use window messages in this model.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>nested transaction</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A secondary transaction initiated from within an existing primary or parent transaction boundary. The primary transaction does not commit until all of its subordinate, or nested, transactions commit. COM+ does not support nested transactions.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>neutral apartment model</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A threading model in which objects follow the guidelines for multithreaded apartments but can execute on any kind of thread. The neutral apartment model is the recommended threading model for COM components and COM+ applications.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>persistent object</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM object that can save its internal state when asked to do so by a client and that conforms to COM-defined standards through which clients can request objects to be initialized, loaded, and saved to and from a data store (for example, flat file, structured storage, or memory). It is the client's responsibility to manage the location where the object's persistent data is stored but not the format of the data.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>persistent object interface</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A COM interface implemented by a persistent object. Clients use persistent object interfaces to tell those persistent objects when and where to store their state.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>phase zero notification interface</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>COM+ interface that allows applications to detect when a transaction is ready to proceed with a two-phase commit protocol so that it can perform the necessary notification operations and communicate to the transaction manager when the operations have been completed.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>physical model</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The third and final step in the COM+ application design process, where the developer determines where the components reside physically and how they are to be coded.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>player</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The architectural element of the COM+ Queued Components service that retrieves the message from a queue and then loads the server object and the standard interface stubs to unmarshal data and invoke server methods. The player unmarshals the client's security context at the server side and then invokes the server component and makes the same method calls. The method calls are not played back by the player until the client component completes and the transaction that recorded the method calls commits.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>presentation tier</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the three-tier architecture model for business applications, the layer that presents data to the user and optionally permits data manipulation and data entry. The two main types of user interface for the presentation tier are the traditional application and the Web-based application. Also called <em>user services layer</em>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>primary access token</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Describes the security context of the user account associated with a process.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>proxy manager</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In standard marshaling, a component that manages all the interface proxies for a single object.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>resource manager</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A service that manages persistent or durable data in databases, durable message queues, or transactional file systems. It is the resource manager that knows how to store data and perform disaster recovery. COM+ server applications use resource managers to maintain the durable state of an application, such as the record of inventory on hand, pending orders, and accounts receivable. Resource managers work in cooperation with the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (DTC) to guarantee atomicity and isolation to an application.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><strong>three-tier architectural model</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The fundamental framework for the logical design model, segments an application's components into three tiers of services as follows: the presentation tier, or user services; the middle tier, or business services; and the data tier, or data services. These tiers do not necessarily correspond to physical locations on various computers on a network, but rather to logical layers of the application.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An event whose sender (publisher) and receiver (subscriber) are closely bound. In a tightly coupled event system, the publisher is provided with an interface on which to call a method when a change occurs. The subscriber knows which publisher to request notification from and the interfaces that are exposed. A tightly coupled event system requires that both the publisher and the subscriber are running at all times.</p>

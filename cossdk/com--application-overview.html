<h1>COM+ Application Overview</h1>
<p>A COM+ application is the primary unit of administration and security for Component Services and consists of a group of COM components that generally perform related functions. These components further consist of interfaces and methods, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/487518b4-0460-4b2d-a834-c4ea57755ffd.png" alt="Diagram that shows interfaces and methods inside boxes, in order of Method inside Interface inside Component inside COM+ Application." /></p>
<p>You can use the Component Services administrative tool to create new COM+ applications, add components to applications, and set the attributes for an application and its components.</p>
<p>By creating logical groups of COM components as COM+ applications, you can take advantage of the following benefits of COM+:</p>
<ul>
<li>A deployment scope for COM components.</li>
<li>A common configuration scope for COM components, including security boundaries and queuing.</li>
<li>Storage of component attributes not provided by the component developer (for example, transactions and synchronization).</li>
<li>Component dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) loaded into processes (DLLHost.exe) on demand.</li>
<li>Managed server processes to host components.</li>
<li>Creation and management of threads used by components.</li>
<li>Access to the context object for resource dispensers, allowing acquired resources to be automatically associated with the context. (For more information on COM components and contexts, see <a href="com--contexts.html">COM+ Contexts</a>.)</li>
</ul>

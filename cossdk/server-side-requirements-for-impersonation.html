<h1>Server-Side Requirements for Impersonation</h1>
<p>The server performs impersonation programmatically. It explicitly assumes the client's security credentials by using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coimpersonateclient"><strong>CoImpersonateClient</strong></a>. When the client has granted the server sufficient authority, this has the effect of substituting the client's security credentials with the server thread token, in place of the process token.</p>
<p>When this has been done, the server can, for example, use the client token to access resources guarded with a security descriptor. Or it can make calls under the client identity, if cloaking is enabled.</p>
<p>The server can explicitly set cloaking programmatically, or it can rely on an administrative setting. By default, COM+ applications are configured to use dynamic cloaking. For more detail, see <a href="cloaking.html">Cloaking</a>.</p>
<p>If the server is implementing delegation on behalf of the clientâ€”using the client identity over networkâ€”the server process identity must be marked as &quot;Trusted for delegation&quot; in the Active Directory Service; otherwise, delegation will fail.</p>
<p>When it has finished using the client's identity, the server can revert to its own process token using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coreverttoself"><strong>CoRevertToSelf</strong></a>.</p>
<p>For details on implementing impersonation and delegation, see <a href="/windows/desktop/com/delegation-and-impersonation">Delegation and Impersonation</a>.</p>

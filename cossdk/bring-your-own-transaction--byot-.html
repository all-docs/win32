<h1>Bring Your Own Transaction (BYOT)</h1>
<p>BYOT allows a component to be created with or to inherit an external transaction. That is, a component that does not already have an associated transaction can acquire a transaction. Currently, MTS transactions are automatic; whether a component instance lives in a transaction is determined at creation time. The transactional attributes of a component and its creator determine what transaction is associated with a given instance. In all cases, MTS controls transaction lifetimes. COM+ extends this to allow setting an arbitrary pre-existing DTC or TIP transaction as the transaction property of a new component's context. This allows configured components to be associated with transactions whose lifetimes are controlled by a TP monitor, OTS, or DBMS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
BYOT transactions must be used with caution. In certain situations, they can result in a transaction spanning multiple synchronization domainsâ€”that is, they allow parallelism with a transaction, causing a deadlock condition. Automatic transactions, rather than BYOT transactions, are the preferred programming model for writers of business components.</p>

<p>The interfaces for BYOT transactions include the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-icreatewithtransactionex"><strong>ICreateWithTransactionEx</strong></a> interface and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-icreatewithtiptransactionex"><strong>ICreateWithTipTransactionEx</strong></a> interface. The <strong>ICreateWithTransactionEx</strong> interface creates an object that is enlisted within a manual transaction. The <strong>ICreateWithTipTransactionEx</strong> interface creates an object that is enlisted within a manual transaction using the Transaction Internet Protocol (TIP).</p>

<h1>Accessing XML Web Services in WKO Mode</h1>
<p>You can access and use any XML web service, even if that XML web service was not created using COM+ or even Microsoft Windows, as long as the XML Web Service publishes a WSDL description of its syntax. Just create an instance of the component by using the soap:wsdl=URL moniker, where URL is the URL of the WSDL description of the XML web service you want to access. This is the well-known object (WKO) mode of accessing XML web services.</p>
<p>The object's methods can be called without any special considerations. The XML web service is accessed via a SOAP query, and the response is interpreted transparently.</p>
<h2>Component Services Administrative Tool</h2>
<p>Does not apply.</p>
<h2>Visual Basic</h2>
<p>The following Microsoft Visual Basic code fragment illustrates the use of an XML web service in WKO mode.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Set Obj = GetObject(&quot;soap:wsdl=https://servername/vroot/progID.soap?WSDL&quot;)
output = Obj.Method(input)
</code></pre>
<p>In this code fragment, which illustrates the use of a component of a COM+ application that has been exposed as an XML web service, servername is the fully qualified domain name of the server offering the XML web service; vroot is the IIS virtual root directory from which the XML web service is exposed; and progID is the ProgID of the component you want to use.</p>
<h2>C/C++</h2>
<p>The following code fragment illustrates the use of an XML web service in WKO mode.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT hr = CoGetObject(
     L&quot;soap:wsdl=https://servername/vroot/progID.soap?WSDL&quot;,
     pBindOptions,
     IID_IUnknown,
     (void**)&amp;pIUnknown);
if (FAILED(hr)) throw(hr); 
</code></pre>
<p>In this code fragment, which illustrates the use of a component of a COM+ application that has been exposed as an XML web service, servername is the fully qualified domain name of the server offering the XML web service; vroot is the IIS virtual root directory from which the XML web service is exposed; and progID is the ProgID of the component you want to use.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>When an XML web service is first accessed in WKO mode, COM+ generates a proxy client and compiles it in the background. This run-time generation and the lack of persistent connections in WKO mode results in significantly reduced performance in comparison to CAO mode.</p>

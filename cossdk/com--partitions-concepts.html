<h1>COM+ Partitions Concepts</h1>
<p>In computing environments where it's necessary to use different versions or configurations of an application on the same computer, conflicts can arise when one version of the application requires different components than the other or when one version requires a component on the computer that is incompatible with the other version of the application. In the past, the only way to solve this problem was to maintain multiple computers and run a different version of the application on each computer. Such an approach is costly and inefficient because it increases hardware costs and administrative overhead.</p>
<p>COM+ solves this problem by providing the COM+ partitions feature. You can use COM+ partitions to install different versions of a COM+ application on a computer and run them simultaneously.</p>
<p>To understand and use this feature, see the following topics:</p>

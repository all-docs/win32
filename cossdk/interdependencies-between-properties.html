<h1>Interdependencies Between Properties</h1>
<p>When you set properties, the COM+ catalog enforces some coherency logic to ensure that you configure elements in a reasonable way. This logic can be implemented in two ways, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dependencies.</strong> You might be blocked from making some changes because another property depends on a particular setting for a property you attempt to set. For example, if a component is set with the attribute Transactions Required and if you then attempt to change the Synchronization setting to None, an error is generated when you attempt to call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComAdmin/nf-comadmin-icatalogcollection-savechanges"><strong>SaveChanges</strong></a> because transactions depend on synchronization.</li>
<li><strong>Side effects.</strong> Some properties might be changed for you without your explicitly setting them. For example, if you set a component with the attribute Transactions Required, Synchronization will be set to Required as well. This is really the flip side of dependenciesâ€”one property takes precedence over another, and its dependency is expressed through first setting the secondary property and then blocking changes to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the list of properties exposed by items in a collection, all listed in <a href="com--administration-collections.html">COM+ Administration Collections</a>, the dependencies and side effects are stated for each property. When you configure COM+ applications and components, you should be aware of what constraints are imposed on configurations.</p>

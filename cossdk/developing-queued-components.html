<h1>Developing Queued Components</h1>
<p>The COM+ queued components service requires all application methods to contain only [in] parameters, with no return values. Because the server object is not necessarily available when the client makes the call, server results can be returned by sending a message that creates another object. In this way, two-way communication occurs not in every case but only when it is required, by a series of one-way messages between objects.</p>
<p>To use the COM+ queued components service, you must have the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms711472(v=vs.85)">Message Queuing</a> service already installed. Message Queuing is not installed automatically. Message Queuing must be selected during the operating system setup or by using <strong>Add/Remove programs</strong>. An internal Message Queuing certificate is created automatically at logon.</p>
<p>The topics described in the following table provide additional considerations for more specialized situations.</p>

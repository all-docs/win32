<h1>Partition Implementation</h1>
<p>When installed on an application server, COM+ automatically creates a partition, known as the <em>global partition</em>. The global partition includes a standard set of COM+ applications. COM+ applications that are installed in the global partition are automatically available to all users on the server. If you have other COM+ applications that you would like to make available to all users on the server, you can add them into the global partition.</p>
<p>In addition to the global partition, you can create other partitions for users on that server only, or for users throughout the domain. Creating additional partitions and installing multiple configurations of a COM+ application into them allows your users to execute those application configurations simultaneously on the same computer. Also, by installing COM+ applications into a partition other than the global partition, you can control user access to those applications.</p>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ XP:</strong> The ability to create, configure, or delegate COM+ partitions is not available. The global partition is the only COM+ partition available.</p>

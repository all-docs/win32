<h1>Controlling Object Lifetime and State</h1>
<p>A pooled object can participate in how COM+ manages its activity in the pool by implementing <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol"><strong>IObjectControl</strong></a>. When a pooled object is created, it is aggregated into a larger object that will manage the object by calling the following methods on <strong>IObjectControl</strong> at regular points in the object's lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-activate"><strong>Activate</strong></a>â€”Called whenever the object is returned to a client, activated in a specific context.</li>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-deactivate"><strong>Deactivate</strong></a>â€”Called whenever an object is released by the client or, in the case of a JIT-activated object, when it is deactivated.</li>
<li><a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>CanBePooled</strong></a>â€”Called whenever an object is to be returned to the general pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementing <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol"><strong>IObjectControl</strong></a> is optional, except for transactional objects, which should always implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>CanBePooled</strong></a> to monitor the state of the resources they hold. However, it is advisable to implement <strong>IObjectControl</strong> in most cases because it provides an efficient way to manage the behavior of a pooled object, as described below.</p>
<h2>Performing Context-Specific Initialization</h2>
<p>Using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-activate"><strong>Activate</strong></a>, you can initialize the object in the context in which it is activated for a given client. For example, to determine whether the object has transaction affinity (its resources may already be enlisted), you might get the transaction ID associated with the context.</p>
<p>Typically you would use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-activate"><strong>Activate</strong></a>to perform initialization that is consistent across any methods exposed by the object, treating it as the context-specific portion of the object's constructor.</p>
<h2>Cleaning Up Any Client State</h2>
<p>Using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-deactivate"><strong>Deactivate</strong></a>, you can get rid of any client-specific state that might exist so that your object returns to the pool in a completely generic state and can then be used by any client without compromising security or isolation.</p>
<h2>Controlling Reuse of the Object</h2>
<p>Using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>CanBePooled</strong></a>, you can monitor the internal state of your object and report on whether it is fit for its reuse. If <strong>CanBePooled</strong> returns True and the pool maximum has not been reached, the object is placed back in the general pool. If <strong>CanBePooled</strong> returns False, the object is discarded. In the case of transactional components, returning False will doom the current transaction.</p>
<p>Typically, you would keep some global data member for the object, and if you detect a connection to be bad or a resource of some kind to be in a bad state, set this to reflect the current situation and return it through <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>CanBePooled</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If an object does not implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>CanBePooled</strong></a>, instances will continue to be reused until the pool maximum level is reached.</p>

<h1>Types of COM+ Applications</h1>
<p>Following are the four basic types of COM+ applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server applications.</strong> A COM+ <em>server application</em> runs in its own process. Server applications can support all COM+ services.</li>
<li><strong>Library applications.</strong> A COM+ <em>library application</em> runs in the process of the client that creates it. More specifically, the components in a library application are always loaded into the process of the creator. Library applications are not explicitly associated with a server process. They can use role-based security but do not support remote access or queued components.</li>
<li><strong>Application proxies.</strong> An <em>application proxy</em> is a set of files containing registration information that allows a client to remotely access a server application. When run on a client computer, an application proxy file writes information about the COM+ server application, including CLSIDs, ProgIDs, RemoteServerName, and marshaling information, to the client computer. The server application can then be accessed remotely from the client computer.</li>
<li><strong>COM+ preinstalled applications</strong>. COM+ includes a set of preinstalled applications that handle internal functions. The preinstalled applications are listed in the COM+ Applications folder in the Component Services administrative tool, but they cannot be modified or deleted. These applications include the following:
<ul>
<li>.NET Utilities</li>
<li>Analyzer Control Publisher Application</li>
<li>COM+ Explorer</li>
<li>COM+ QC Dead Letter Queue Listener</li>
<li>COM+ Utilities</li>
<li>IIS In-Process Applications</li>
<li>IIS Out-Of-Process Pooled Applications</li>
<li>System Application</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>As of Windows ServerÂ 2003, it is possible to run COM+ applications even if the System Application is disabled. The COM+ applications will run, though without the services usually provided by the System Application. These services include use of the Component Services administrative tool and system event tracking.</p>
<p>Also as of Windows ServerÂ 2003, the authentication capability for the COM+ System Application includes the value EOAC_DISABLE_AAA. This value, which disables activate-as-activator (AAA) activations, is used with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity"><strong>CoInitializeSecurity</strong></a> function when launching the System Application. Setting the authentication capability to EOAC_DISABLE_AAA allows an application that runs under a privileged account (such as LocalSystem) to help prevent its identity from being used to launch untrusted components.</p>

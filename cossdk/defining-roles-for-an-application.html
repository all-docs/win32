<h1>Defining Roles for an Application</h1>
<p>You determine a security policy for an application by defining the security privileges that it requires. To do this you declare a symbolic level of privilege as a roleâ€”that is, define the role for the applicationâ€”and then <a href="assigning-roles-to-components--interfaces--or-methods.html">assign the role</a> to specific resources within the application. This design is fulfilled when the application is deployed and system administrators populate the role with actual users and user groups. For greater detail, see <a href="role-based-security-administration.html">Role-Based Security Administration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To add a role to an application</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool, locate the COM+ application to which you want to add the role. Expand the tree to view the folders for the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click the <strong>Roles</strong> folder for the application, point to <strong>New</strong>, and then click <strong>Role</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <strong>Role</strong>dialog box, type the name of the new role in the box provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
After adding roles to the application, you must be sure to assign the roles to the appropriate components, interfaces, and methods. Otherwise, if role-based security has been chosen and enabled and if roles have been added but not assigned, all calls to the application will fail. For more information, see <a href="assigning-roles-to-components--interfaces--or-methods.html">Assigning Roles to Components, Interfaces, or Methods</a>.</p>

<h1>Role-Based Security Administration</h1>
<p>Role-based security is an automatic service provided by COM+ that enables you to administratively construct and enforce an access control policy for your COM+ application. With a flexible and extensible security configuration model, role-based security offers a considerable advantage over enforcing all security within your components and provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can configure security administratively, using either the Component Services administrative tool or the Administrative functions.</li>
<li>You don't have to write security-related logic into your components when role protection at the method level provides you with fine enough access control.</li>
<li>You don't have to factor security into interface or component design. Instead, you can set security on a method-by-method basis.</li>
<li>You can focus on the structure of the security policy you want to enforce, and through roles, that policy can be clearly expressed to the administrators deploying your application.</li>
<li>You can easily modify a security policy to adapt to evolving security requirements for an application.</li>
<li>You can build more granular security policies programmatically if you need to, using role-based security as a supporting platform.</li>
<li>You can leverage role-based security to do detailed auditing, because you can obtain caller security information for an entire chain of upstream calls.</li>
</ul>

<p>[!Note]<br />
Users in the Administrator role for the System Application must be members of the local administrators group. Also, as of Windows ServerÂ 2003, the authentication capability for the COM+ System Application includes the value EOAC_DISABLE_AAA. This value, which disables activate-as-activator (AAA) activations, is used in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity"><strong>CoInitializeSecurity</strong></a> call when launching the System Application. Setting the authentication capability to EOAC_DISABLE_AAA allows an application that runs under a privileged account (such as LocalSystem) to help prevent its identity from being used to launch untrusted components.</p>

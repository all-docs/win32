<h1>Debugging COM+ Applications</h1>
<p>Debugging techniques for COM+ applications depend on the language in which you choose to write your component.</p>
<p>If you code in Microsoft Visual C++, you can launch the debugger in C++ or, with a remote client, you can debug by using OLE remote procedure control (RPC) and just-in-time (JIT) debugging. You can always use the Component Services administrative tool to debug your component with the COM+ <strong>Launch in debugger</strong> setting on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab of the COM+ application's <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box. For more information on debugging components coded in C++, see <a href="debugging-components-written-in-visual-c--.html">Debugging Components Written in Visual C++</a>.</p>
<p>Unless you are currently debugging multithreading, component tracking, remote calls, or process isolation, you can use the Microsoft Visual Basic environment for debugging purposes. <a href="debugging-components-written-in-visual-basic.html">Debugging Components Written in Visual Basic</a> describes the debugging process within a Visual Basic environment.</p>
<p>The topic <a href="debugging-in-the-visual-basic-ide.html">Debugging in the Visual Basic IDE</a> provides a general overview with guidelines, tips and a procedure on debugging in the integrated development environment (IDE).</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
Several limitations associated with using the Visual Basic environment to debug components with MTS have been resolved for COM+. For more information, see <a href="com--visual-basic-debugging-support-contrasted-with-mts.html">COM+ Visual Basic Debugging Support Contrasted with MTS</a>.</p>

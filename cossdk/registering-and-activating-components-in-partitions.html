<h1>Registering and Activating Components in Partitions</h1>
<p>After a partition has been created, the next step is register your COM+ components within that partition. A component is registered within a partition when a new COM+ application is created or when an existing COM+ application is installed into the partition. To ease the administration of registration when multiple partitions contain the same COM+ components, the partitions service allows an administrator to copy applications or components from one partition into another. When a COM+ application or a component is copied, all associated partition properties are copied with it, except the application's identity or any of the members of a role.</p>
<p>When the client program calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance"><strong>CoCreateInstance</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/objbase/nf-objbase-cogetobject"><strong>CoGetObject</strong></a> function to instantiate an object, COM+ performs two distinct steps, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Locates the partition in which the component resides</li>
<li>Locates the correct component within that partition</li>
</ol>
<p>The following topics in this section describe these steps in detail:</p>

<h1>Accessing XML Web Services in CAO Mode</h1>
<p>If the XML web service you want to access was created by exposing a COM+ application, consider accessing it in client-activated object (CAO) mode, which avoids the run-time generation of a proxy and increases performance by using persistent connections. To access an XML web service in CAO mode, first <a href="exporting-a-soap-enabled-application.html">export</a> the corresponding SOAP-enabled application from your server in proxy mode and then <a href="importing-a-soap-enabled-application.html">import</a> the application into the client from which you want to access the application as an XML web service. The application's components can then be instantiated on the client just like the components of local applicationsâ€”for example, using <strong>GetObject</strong> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance"><strong>CoCreateInstance</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>Does not apply.</p>
<h2>Visual Basic</h2>
<p>The following Visual Basic code fragment illustrates the use of a component of a COM+ application that has been exposed as an XML web service in CAO mode.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Set Obj = GetObject(&quot;progID&quot;)
output = Obj.Method(input)
</code></pre>
<h2>C/C++</h2>
<p>The following code fragment illustrates the use of a component of a COM+ application that has been exposed as an XML web service in CAO mode.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance(
     CLSID_CObject,  // CLSID of the server component
     NULL,
     pBindOptions,
     IID_IUnknown,
     (void**)&amp;pIUnknown);
if (FAILED(hr)) throw(hr);
</code></pre>

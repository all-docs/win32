<h1>Managing Partitions Within Active Directory</h1>
<p>As an alternative to managing Active Directory partitions through the Active Directory Users and Computers administrative tool, you can manage COM+ partitions programmatically through the use of a set of COM+ objects within Active Directory System Interface (ADSI).</p>
<p>Regardless of the administrative technique you choose for managing COM+ partitions, there is a general sequence of steps that administrators must follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the new COM+ partitions within Active Directory for your domain.</li>
<li>Create COM+ partition sets within Active Directory, and map them to your newly created COM+ partitions.</li>
<li>Configure your Active Directory partitions on your local machine, using the appropriate COM+ object. When you configure an Active Directory partition on a local machine, a <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder is automatically created in that partition folder.</li>
<li>Install your COM+ applications in the appropriate COM+ partitions.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the preceding steps can be done programmatically, using a set of Active Directory interfaces called ADSI. The objects available for managing partitions that are available within ADSI are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>DS_USERPARTITIONSETLINK_NAME</li>
<li>DS_PARTITIONLINK_NAME</li>
<li>DS_OBJECTID_NAME</li>
<li>DS_DEFAULTPARTITIONLINK_NAME</li>
<li>DS_USERLINK_NAME</li>
<li>DS_PARTITIONSET_NAME</li>
<li>DS_PARTITION_NAME</li>
</ul>
<p>For information on creating and managing COM+ partitions through the use of the Active Directory Users and Computers and Component Services administrative tools, see the online help available from within each tool.</p>

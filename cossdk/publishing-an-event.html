<h1>Publishing an Event</h1>
<p>To publish an event, just instantiate an event object by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance"><strong>CoCreateInstance</strong></a> or the Microsoft Visual Basic <strong>CreateObject</strong> method using EventClassID or EventClassName as an argument. The publisher calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)"><strong>QueryInterface</strong></a> on the event object to obtain the interfaces supported by the event class object and invokes a method on the event object through the interface to publish the event. The event system then publishes events on the event class CLSID_EventObjectChange with the interface ID IID_IEventObjectChange.</p>
<p>To support delivery of events to multiple subscribers, event class methods should contain only in parameters.</p>
<p>By using the FireInParallel property of the <a href="the-com--event-class-object.html">event class</a> object, publishers can request that the event system use multiple threads to deliver an event to more than one subscriber. Selecting an in-parallel delivery mechanism does not guarantee simultaneous delivery of the event to multiple subscribers, but it instructs the COM+ events service to permit this to happen.</p>

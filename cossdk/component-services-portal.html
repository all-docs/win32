<h1>COM+ (Component Services)</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>COM+ is an evolution of Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). COM+ builds on and extends applications written using COM, MTS, and other COM-based technologies. COM+ handles many of the resource management tasks that you previously had to program yourself, such as thread allocation and security. COM+ also makes your applications more scalable by providing thread pooling, object pooling, and just-in-time object activation. COM+ also helps protect the integrity of your data by providing transaction support, even if a transaction spans multiple databases over a network.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>COM+ can be used to develop enterprise-wide, mission-critical, distributed applications for Windows.</p>
<p>If you are a system administrator, you will be installing, deploying, and configuring COM+ applications and their components. If you are an application programmer, you will be writing components and integrating them as applications. If you are a tools vendor, you will be developing or modifying tools to work in the COM+ environment.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>COM+ is designed primarily for Microsoft Visual C++ and Microsoft Visual Basic developers.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>COM+ version 1.5 is included in Windows starting with WindowsÂ XP and Windows ServerÂ 2003. COM+ version 1.0 is included in WindowsÂ 2000.</p>

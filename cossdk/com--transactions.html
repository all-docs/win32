<h1>COM+ Transactions</h1>
<p>When you purchase a book from an online bookstore, you use a credit card to trade money for a book. After you submit your order, a series of related operations (validation of your credit card, verification of inventory availability, and so forth) ensures that you get the book and that the bookstore gets your money. If a single operation in the series fails during the exchange, the entire exchange fails. You do not get the book, and the bookstore does not get your money.</p>
<p>The technology responsible for making this online exchange balanced and predictable is called <em>transaction processing</em>. Programmatically, a <em>transaction</em> is a unit of work in which a series of operations occur. COM+ uses programmatic transactions to ensure that resources are not permanently updated unless all operations within the transaction complete successfully. By binding a set of related operations together in a COM+ transaction that either completely succeeds or completely fails, you can vastly simplify error recovery.</p>
<p>The following topics introduce general transaction processing theory, provide a closer look at transactions in COM+, and present practical tips for writing transactional components.</p>

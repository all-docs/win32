<h1>Moving a User Account or Group to a Different Role</h1>
<p>You can remove user accounts or groups from a role when the users or members of the groups should no longer be given access to the application resources to which the role is assigned.</p>
<p><strong>To remove a user account or group from a role</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool, locate the COM+ application that contains the role you are interested in. Expand the view in the console tree until the users for the role are visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click the user account or group you want to remove, and then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When prompted by the <strong>Confirm Item Delete</strong> dialog box, click <strong>Yes</strong> to delete the user account or group.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The user account or group that you have removed from the role no longer appears in the <strong>Users</strong> folder. The new role membership takes effect the next time the application is started. If you have made changes to the <strong>System Application</strong>, you must restart the computer for the changes to take effect.</p>

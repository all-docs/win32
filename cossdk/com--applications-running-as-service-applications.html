<h1>COM+ Applications Running as Service Applications</h1>
<p>COM+ developers can use the Component Services administrative tool to configure and implement a COM+ server application as a service application. This means that the server can be automatically started or restarted if your application always needs to be running; that your COM+ application can run as the local system account if it needs to perform privileged operations; and that your application's dependent services can now be started automatically.</p>
<p>The following topics provide background and task information about configuring your applications to run as service applications.</p>

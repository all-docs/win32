<h1>Importing Components</h1>
<p>You can use the Component Services administrative tool to import into applications specific components that have already been registered on your computer as COM components in the Windows registry. Importing a component does not install the interface or method information required to set interface properties or to configure access to the component from a remote client. Therefore, if possible, you should install rather than import unconfigured components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
When importing a component into a COM+ application, COM+ does not populate interface and method information for the component. During the export of an application proxy, COM+ will not provide marshaling information (type libraries or proxy/stubs) for some or all of the interfaces. Exporting application proxies that contain imported components will fail or cause a warning to be issued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p><strong>To import a component into a COM+ application</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool, select the computer hosting the COM+ application.</p>

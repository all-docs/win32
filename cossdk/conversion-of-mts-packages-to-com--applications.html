<h1>Conversion of MTS Packages to COM+ Applications</h1>
<p>COM+ can be viewed as a merging of Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) and COM, along with the introduction of new features.</p>
<p>For the most part, your MTS packages are converted to COM+ applications during the Windows setup procedure. Without doing anything beyond the typical setup, you can take advantage of all the new COM+ features. For a list and brief explanation of the most significant COM+ improvements, see <a href="com--programming-overview.html">COM+ Programming Overview</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the automatic conversion of MTS packages to COM+ applications during the Windows setup process, as well as how to troubleshoot any errors that might occur during this process, see <a href="automatic-conversion-from-mts.html">Automatic Conversion from MTS</a>.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn how to manually convert MTS packages to COM+ applications, see <a href="manual-conversion-from-mts.html">Manual Conversion from MTS</a>.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that installing COM+ introduces several new capabilities that your MTS packages may be able to use as COM+ applications. These are explained in <a href="com--conversion-results-and-issues.html">COM+ Conversion Results and Issues</a>.</p>

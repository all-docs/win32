<h1>Requirements for Poolable Objects</h1>
<p>Poolable objects must meet certain requirements to enable a single object instance to be used by multiple clients.</p>
<h2>Stateless</h2>
<p>To maintain security, consistency, and isolation, poolable objects should hold no client-specific state from client to client. You can manage any per-client state by using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol"><strong>IObjectControl</strong></a>, performing context-specific initialization with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-activate"><strong>IObjectControl::Activate</strong></a> and cleaning up any client state with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-deactivate"><strong>IObjectControl::Deactivate</strong></a>. For more detail, see <a href="controlling-object-lifetime-and-state.html">Controlling Object Lifetime and State</a>.</p>
<h2>No Thread Affinity</h2>
<p>Poolable objects cannot be bound to a particular thread; otherwise, performance could be potentially disastrous. For this reason, poolable objects cannot be marked to run in the apartment model; they must run in the multithreaded apartment or the neutral apartment. In addition, poolable objects should not use thread local storage nor should they aggregate the free-threaded marshaler. For more detail about threading in COM+, see <a href="com--threading-models.html">COM+ Threading Models</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and earlier development environments can create only apartment model components. However, in Visual Basic .NET, components can be pooled.</p>

<h2>Aggregatable</h2>
<p>Poolable objects must support aggregationâ€”that is, they must support being created by invoking <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cocreateinstance"><strong>CoCreateInstance</strong></a> with a non-NULL <em>pUnkOuter</em> argument. When COM+ activates a pooled object, it creates an aggregate to manage the lifetime of the pooled object and to call methods on <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol"><strong>IObjectControl</strong></a>. For details on writing aggregatable objects, see <a href="/windows/desktop/com/aggregation">Aggregation</a>.</p>
<h2>Transactional Components</h2>
<p>Poolable objects that participate in transactions must manually enlist managed resources. While it is pooled, if your object holds a managed resource such as a database connection, there will be no way for the resource manager to automatically enlist in a transaction when the object is activated in given context. Therefore, the object itself must handle the logic of detecting the transaction, turning off the resource manager's auto-enlistment and manually enlisting any resources that it holds. In addition, a transactional pooled object should reflect the current state of its resources in the parameter values of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>IObjectControl::CanBePooled</strong></a>. For more detail, see <a href="pooling-transactional-objects.html">Pooling Transactional Objects</a>.</p>
<h2>Implement IObjectControl to Manage the Object Lifetime</h2>
<p>Poolable objects should implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol"><strong>IObjectControl</strong></a>, although it is not strictly necessary to do so. Transactional components that are pooled, however, must implement <strong>IObjectControl</strong>. These components should monitor the state of the resources they hold and indicate when they can't be reused; when <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>IObjectControl::CanBePooled</strong></a> returns false, it will doom a transaction. For more detail, see <a href="controlling-object-lifetime-and-state.html">Controlling Object Lifetime and State</a>.</p>
<h2>Language Restrictions</h2>
<p>Components developed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 and earlier cannot be pooled because these components will be apartment-model threaded. However, in Visual Basic .NET, components can be pooled.</p>
<h2>Legacy Components</h2>
<p>As long as they are non-transactional and conform to the appropriate preceding requirements, components can be pooled even if they were not specifically written with pooling capability in mind. It is not necessary to implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nn-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol"><strong>IObjectControl</strong></a>; a component that does not do so simply won't participate in managing its lifetime. If <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComSvcs/nf-comsvcs-iobjectcontrol-canbepooled"><strong>IObjectControl::CanBePooled</strong></a> is not implemented, the object will continue to be reused until the pool attains maximum size.</p>

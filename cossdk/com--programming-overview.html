<h1>COM+ Programming Overview</h1>
<p>COM+ provides an enterprise development environment, based on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM), for creating component-based, distributed applications. It also provides you with the tools to create transactional, multi-tier applications. COM+ combines enhancements to traditional COM-based development with many useful programming and administrative services. See <a href="com--services.html">COM+ Services</a> for a complete list of these services.</p>
<p>The COM enhancements include improvements in both threading and security, along with the introduction of synchronization services. The services include the Component Services administrative tool.</p>
<p>For those familiar with COM programming, the COM+ improvements are significant, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>COM+ implements a threading model called neutral apartment threading, which allows a component to have serialized access along with the ability to execute on any thread.</li>
<li>COM+ supports components with a special environment called a <a href="com--contexts.html">context</a>, which provides an extensible set of properties that define the execution environment for the component.</li>
<li>COM+ provides role-based security, asynchronous object execution, and a built-in moniker that represents a reference to an object instance running on an out-of-process server.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Application and Component Administration</h2>
<p>In COM+, a registration database, named RegDB, stores the metadata that describes components. This database is highly optimized for the type of information that COM+ needs for activation of components and is used instead of the system registry. In addition, COM+ exposes the <em>COM+ catalog</em>, which accesses information in the RegDB. The COM+ catalog is a system data store that contains configuration information for COM+ applications on a given server computer.</p>
<p>Finally, the Component Services administrative tool provides a fully scriptable user interface for developers and administrators to administer components as well as deploy both client-side and server-side multitier applications. For more information, see <a href="deploying-com--applications.html">Deploying COM+ Applications</a>.</p>
<h2>Automatic Transactions</h2>
<p>COM+ supports all Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) 2.0 semantics and adds the <a href="enabling-auto-done-for-a-method.html">auto-done</a> capability, which you can set by using the Component Services administrative tool. This feature enables the system to abort a transaction automatically if an exception is triggered or to commit if not. For more information, see <a href="com--transactions.html">COM+ Transactions</a>, and <a href="com--just-in-time-activation.html">COM+ Just-in-Time Activation</a>.</p>

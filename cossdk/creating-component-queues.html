<h1>Creating Component Queues</h1>
<p>An application that contains at least one queuable component can be marked as queued using the component services administrative tool.</p>
<p>When an application is marked as queued, COM+ automatically creates a message queuing queue for it. The queue name is the name of the application; if the queue name matches the name of an existing queue, COM+ will use the existing queue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The Message Queuing <em>PathName</em> parameter is a combination of the Remote Server Name (RSN) and the COM+ application name. The RSN refers to the target of a remote activation. You specify an RSN during the installation of a client exportable application on a client computer. The installation procedure uses the RSN to direct activation to a specified client computer. For more information about queue names, refer to the table of parameters in the &quot;Queue Moniker Parameters&quot; section in <a href="using-the-queue-moniker.html">Using the Queue Moniker</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Component Services Administrative Tool</h2>
<p>To specify a COM+ application as queued, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the console tree of the Component Services administrative tool, under <strong>Component Services</strong>, open the <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder associated with the computer you wish to manage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-click the application for which you wish to create a queue, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Queuing</strong> tab in the properties dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activate the check box labeled <strong>Queued â€“ This application can be reached by MSMQ queues</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If the <strong>Queued</strong> check box is grayed out, the application contains no queuable components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Visual Basic</h2>
<p>Does not apply.</p>
<h2>C/C++</h2>
<p>Does not apply.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Queues created by the COM+ Administration Library or the Component Services administrative tool are marked with the Message Queuing transactional attribute.</p>
<p>After a queued application is installed at the server, it can be made available to clients by exporting the application and then importing the application at each client.</p>

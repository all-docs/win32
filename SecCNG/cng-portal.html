<h1>Cryptography API: Next Generation</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) is the long-term replacement for the <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>CryptoAPI</em></a>. CNG is designed to be extensible at many levels and cryptography agnostic in behavior.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>CNG is intended for use by developers of applications that will enable users to create and exchange documents and other data in a secure environment, especially over nonsecure media such as the Internet. Developers should be familiar with the C and C++ programming languages and the Windows-based programming environment. Although not required, an understanding of cryptography or security-related subjects is advised.</p>
<p>If you are developing a CNG cryptographic algorithm provider or key storage provider, you must download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30688">Cryptographic Provider Development Kit</a> from Microsoft.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>CNG is supported beginning with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.</p>

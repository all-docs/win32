<h1>File Management (Local File Systems)</h1>
<p>A <em>file object</em> provides a representation of a resource (either a physical device or a resource located on a physical device) that can be managed by the I/O system. Like other objects, they enable sharing of the resource, they have names, they are protected by object-based security, and they support synchronization. The I/O system also enables reading from or writing to the resource.</p>

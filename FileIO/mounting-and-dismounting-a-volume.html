<h1>Creating Mounted Folders</h1>
<p>Creating a mounted folder is a two-step process. First, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-getvolumenameforvolumemountpointw"><strong>GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPoint</strong></a> with the mount point (drive letter, volume GUID path, or mounted folder) of the volume to be assigned to the mounted folder. Then use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-setvolumemountpointa"><strong>SetVolumeMountPoint</strong></a> function to associate the returned volume GUID path with the desired directory on another volume. For example code, see <a href="mounting-a-volume-at-a-mount-point.html">Creating a Mounted Folder</a>.</p>
<p>Your application can designate any empty directory on a volume other than the root as a mounted folder. When you call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-setvolumemountpointa"><strong>SetVolumeMountPoint</strong></a> function, that directory becomes the mounted folder. You can assign the same volume to multiple mounted folders.</p>
<p>After the mounted folder has been established, it is maintained through computer restarts automatically.</p>
<p>If a volume fails, any volumes that have been assigned to mounted folders on that volume can no longer be accessed through those mounted folders. For example, suppose you have two volumes, C: and D:, and that D: is associated with the mounted folder C:\MountD\. If volume C: fails, volume D: can no longer be accessed through the path C:\MountD\.</p>
<p>Only NTFS file system volumes can have mounted folders, but the target volumes for the mounted folders can be non-NTFS volumes.</p>
<p>Mounted folders are implemented by using reparse points and are subject to their restrictions. For more information, see <a href="reparse-points.html">Reparse Points</a>. It is not necessary to manipulate reparse points to use mounted folders; functions such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-setvolumemountpointa"><strong>SetVolumeMountPoint</strong></a> handle all the reparse point details for you.</p>
<p>Because mounted folders are directories, you can rename, remove, move, and otherwise manipulate them, as you would other directories.</p>
<p>(Note: The TechNet documentation uses the term <em>mounted drives</em> to refer to <em>mounted folders</em>.)</p>

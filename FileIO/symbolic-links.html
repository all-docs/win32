<h1>Symbolic Links</h1>
<p>A symbolic link is a file-system object that points to another file system object. The object being pointed to is called the target.</p>
<p>Symbolic links are transparent to users; the links appear as normal files or directories, and can be acted upon by the user or application in exactly the same manner.</p>
<p>Symbolic links are designed to aid in migration and application compatibility with UNIX operating systems. Microsoft has implemented its symbolic links to function just like UNIX links.</p>

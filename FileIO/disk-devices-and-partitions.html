<h1>Disk Devices and Partitions</h1>
<p>A hard disk consists of a set of stacked platters, each of which has data stored electromagnetically in concentric circles, or <em>tracks</em>. Each platter has two heads, one on each side of the platter, that reads or writes data as the disk spins. A <em>hard disk drive</em> controls the positioning, reading, and writing of the hard disk. Note that the heads of all platters are positioned as a unit.</p>
<p>The smallest addressable unit of a track is a <em>sector</em>. A <em>cylinder</em> is defined as the set of tracks that appear in the same location on each platter. For example, the following diagram shows a hard disk with four platters. Cylinder X consists of eight tracks (track X from each side of each platter).</p>

<p>A hard disk can contain one or more logical regions called <em>partitions</em>. Partitions are created when the user formats a hard disk as a <em>basic disk</em>. Windows also supports <em>dynamic disks</em>, which are not discussed in this topic. For more information about basic disks and dynamic disks, see <a href="basic-and-dynamic-disks.html">Basic and Dynamic Disks</a>.</p>
<p>The creation of multiple partitions on a disk allows the appearance of having separate hard drives. For example, a system with one hard disk that has one partition contains a single volume, designated by the system as drive C. A system with a hard disk with two partitions typically contains drives C and D. Having multiple partitions on a hard disk can make it easier to manage the system, for example to organize files or to support multiple users.</p>
<p>The first physical sector on a basic disk contains a data structure known as the Master Boot Record (MBR). The MBR contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A boot program (up to 442 bytes in size)</li>
<li>A disk signature (a unique 4-byte number)</li>
<li>A partition table (up to four entries)</li>
<li>An end-of-MBR marker (always 0x55AA)</li>
</ul>

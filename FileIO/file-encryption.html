<h1>File Encryption</h1>
<p>The Encrypted File System, or EFS, provides an additional level of security for files and directories. It provides cryptographic protection of individual files on NTFS file system volumes using a public-key system.</p>
<p>Typically, the access control to file and directory objects provided by the Windows security model is sufficient to protect unauthorized access to sensitive information. However, if a laptop that contains sensitive data is lost or stolen, the security protection of that data may be compromised. Encrypting the files increases security.</p>
<p>To determine whether a file system supports file encryption for files and directories, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-getvolumeinformationa"><strong>GetVolumeInformation</strong></a> function and examine the <strong>FS_FILE_ENCRYPTION</strong> bit flag. Note that the following items cannot be encrypted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compressed files</li>
<li>System files</li>
<li>System directories</li>
<li>Root directories</li>
<li>Transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>Sparse files can be encrypted.</p>
<p>TxF does not support most operations on Encrypted File System (EFS) files. The only operations TxF supports are read operations, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-readencryptedfileraw"><strong>ReadEncryptedFileRaw</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
When the source file is encrypted, <strong>CopyFile</strong> and <strong>CopyFileEx</strong> rely on the EFS service (hosted in lsass.exe) to create the target file and apply keys used in encryption of the source file. These operations are performed by EFS service while impersonating the caller of <strong>CopyFile</strong> or <strong>CopyFileEx</strong>.</p>

<h1>Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview</h1>
<p>The Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol is a network file sharing protocol, and as implemented in Microsoft Windows is known as Microsoft SMB Protocol. The set of message packets that defines a particular version of the protocol is called a dialect. The Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol is a dialect of SMB. Both SMB and CIFS are also available on VMS, several versions of Unix, and other operating systems.</p>
<p>The technical reference to CIFS is available from Microsoft Corporation at <a href="/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/d416ff7c-c536-406e-a951-4f04b2fd1d2b">Common Internet File System (CIFS) File Access Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>Although its main purpose is file sharing, additional Microsoft SMB Protocol functionality includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="microsoft-smb-protocol-dialects.html">Dialect negotiation</a></li>
<li>Determining other Microsoft SMB Protocol servers on the network, or network browsing</li>
<li>Printing over a network</li>
<li><a href="microsoft-smb-protocol-authentication.html">File, directory, and share access authentication</a></li>
<li>File and record locking</li>
<li>File and directory change notification</li>
<li>Extended file attribute handling</li>
<li>Unicode support</li>
<li><a href="opportunistic-locks.html">Opportunistic locks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In the OSI networking model, Microsoft SMB Protocol is most often used as an Application layer or a Presentation layer protocol, and it relies on lower-level protocols for transport. The transport layer protocol that Microsoft SMB Protocol is most often used with is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (<a href="/previous-versions//bb870909(v=vs.85)">NBT</a>). However, Microsoft SMB Protocol can also be used without a separate transport protocol the Microsoft SMB Protocol/NBT combination is generally used for backward compatibility.</p>
<p>The Microsoft SMB Protocol is a client-server implementation and consists of a set of data packets, each containing a request sent by the client or a response sent by the server. These packets can be broadly classified as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session control packets Establishes and discontinues a connection to shared server resources.</li>
<li>File access packets Accesses and manipulates files and directories on the remote server.</li>
<li>General message packets Sends data to print queues, mailslots, and named pipes, and provides data about the status of print queues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some message packets may be grouped and sent in one transmission to reduce response latency and increase network bandwidth. This is called &quot;batching.&quot; The <a href="microsoft-smb-protocol-packet-exchange-scenario.html">Microsoft SMB Protocol Packet Exchange Scenario</a> section describes an example of a Microsoft SMB Protocol session that uses packet batching.</p>

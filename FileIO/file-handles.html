<h1>File Handles</h1>
<p>When a file is opened by a process using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a> function, a <em>file handle</em> is associated with it until either the process terminates or the handle is closed using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle"><strong>CloseHandle</strong></a> function. The file handle is used to identify the file in many function calls.</p>
<p>Each file handle and file object is generally unique to each process that opens a fileâ€”the only exceptions to this are when a file handle held by a process is duplicated, or when a child process inherits the file handles of the parent process. In these situations, these file handles are unique, but see a single, shared file object. See <a href="/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-duplicatehandle"><strong>DuplicateHandle</strong></a> for more information on duplicating file handles held by processes.</p>
<p>Note that while the file handles are typically private to a process, the file data that the file handles point to is not. Therefore, processes and threads that share the same file must synchronize their access. For most operations on a file, a process identifies the file through its private pool of handles.</p>

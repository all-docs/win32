<h1>Mounted Folders</h1>
<p>The NTFS file system supports mounted folders. A <em>mounted folder</em> is an association between a volume and a directory on another volume. When a mounted folder is created, users and applications can access the target volume either by using the path to the mounted folder or by using the volume's drive letter. For example, a user can create a mounted folder to associate drive D: with the C:\Mnt\DDrive folder on drive C. After creating the mounted folder, the user can use the &quot;C:\Mnt\DDrive&quot; path to access drive D: as if it were a folder on drive C:.</p>
<p>Using mounted folders, you can unify disparate file systems such as the NTFS file system, a 16-bit FAT file system, and an ISO-9660 file system on a CD-ROM drive into one logical file system on a single NTFS volume. Neither users nor applications need information about the target volume on which a specific file is located. All the information they need to locate a specified file is a complete path using a mounted folder on the NTFS volume. Volumes can be rearranged, substituted, or subdivided into many volumes without users or applications needing to change settings.</p>

<h1>System-level Administration of Disk Quotas</h1>
<p>The system administrator can set quotas for specific users on a volume. The administrator can also set default quotas for the volume. A new user on the volume receives the default quota unless the administrator established a quota specifically for that user.</p>
<p>The administrator can query the level of quota tracking and enforcement (or quota states), the default quota limits, and the per-user quota information. The per-user quota information contains the user's hard quota limit, warning threshold, and the quota usage. The administrator can also enable or disable quota enforcement.</p>
<p>There are three quota states, as shown in the following table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>State</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Quota disabled</td>
<td>Quota usage changes are not tracked, but the quota limits are not removed. In this state, performance is not affected by disk quotas. This is the default state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quota tracked</td>
<td>Quota usage changes are tracked, but quota limits are not enforced. In this state, no quota violation events are generated and no file operations fail because of disk quota violations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quota enforced</td>
<td>Quota usage changes are tracked and quota limits are enforced.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

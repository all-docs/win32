<h1>File Objects</h1>
<p><em>File objects</em> function as the logical interface between kernel and user-mode processes and the file data that resides on the physical disk. A file object contains both the data written to the file and the following set of kernel-maintained attributes.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Information type</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>File name</td>
<td>Names the corresponding physical file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Current byte offset</td>
<td>Used in synchronous file I/O (described later in this section) to identify the current starting location of read and write operations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Share mode</td>
<td>Specifies whether a second process can open a file for read, write, or delete access while the initial process is still accessing it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I/O mode</td>
<td>Specifies whether the initial process opened the file for <a href="synchronous-and-asynchronous-i-o.html">synchronous or asynchronous I/O</a>, cached or uncached I/O, sequential or random I/O, and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pointer to device object</td>
<td>Identifies the physical device the file data resides on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pointer to the volume parameter block, or <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_vpb"><strong>VPB</strong></a></td>
<td>Identifies the volume or partition the file data resides on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pointer to section object pointers</td>
<td>Identifies a root structure that describes a <a href="/windows/desktop/Memory/file-mapping">mapped file</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pointer to private cache map</td>
<td>Identifies the file data that is currently cached.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>These attributes are defined as part of the <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/content/wdm/ns-wdm-_file_object"><strong>FILE_OBJECT</strong></a> structure in Ntddk.h. Refer to the definition of this structure in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) documentation for the data lengths and types of the values.</p>

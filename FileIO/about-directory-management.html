<h1>About Directory Management</h1>
<p>A directory that contains one or more directories is the <em>parent</em> of the contained directory or directories, and each contained directory is a <em>child</em> of the parent directory. The hierarchical structure of directories is referred to as a <em>directory tree</em>.</p>
<p>The NTFS file system implements the logical link between a directory and the files it contains as a <em>directory entry table</em>. When a file is moved into a directory, an entry is created in the table for the moved file and the name of the file is placed in the entry. When a file contained in a directory is deleted, the name and entry corresponding to the deleted file is also deleted from the table. More than one entry for a single file can exist in a directory entry table. If an additional entry is created in the table for a file, that entry is referred to as a <em>hard link</em> to that file. There is no limit to the number of hard links that can be created for a single file.</p>
<p>Directories can also contain junctions and reparse points.</p>

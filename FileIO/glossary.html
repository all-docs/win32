<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Availability means that a resource manager will abort transactions even if that would break consistency so that the system can continue to do new work. The default resource manager forces availability on the system volume. For example, if the transaction log is full, new transaction log space cannot be added, and an older transaction that would be aborted requires an outcome to be delivered from a superior resource manager in order for a distributed transaction to complete, the resource manager will not wait for the superior transaction manager and abort that transaction even though that potentially breaks consistency.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Consistency means that a resource manager will fail new transactions if it cannot make forward progress. For example, if the transaction log is full, new transaction log space cannot be added, and an older transaction that would be aborted requires an outcome to be delivered from a superior resource manager in order for a distributed transaction to complete, the resource manager will wait for that outcome.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A miniversion is a version of a file that a transacted writer creates during a transaction. The miniversion can be opened later in the transaction with read-only access.</p>

<h1>Microsoft SMB Protocol Authentication</h1>
<p>The security model used in Microsoft SMB Protocol is identical to the one used by other variants of SMB and consists of two levels of securityâ€”user and share. A share is a file, directory, or printer that can be accessed by Microsoft SMB Protocol clients.</p>
<p>User-level authentication indicates that the client attempting to access a share on a server must provide a username and password. When authenticated, the user can then access all shares on a server not also protected by share-level security. This security level allows system administrators to specifically determine which users and groups can access a share.</p>
<p>Share-level authentication indicates that access to a share is controlled by a password assigned to that share only. Unlike user-level security, this security level does not require a username for authentication and no user identity is established.</p>
<p>Under both security levels, the password is encrypted before it is sent to the server. <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthN/microsoft-ntlm">NTLM</a> and the older LAN Manager (LM) encryption are supported by Microsoft SMB Protocol. Both encryption methods use challenge-response authentication, where the server sends the client a random string and the client returns a computed response string that proves the client has sufficient credentials for access.</p>

title: Appending One File to Another File
ms.topic: article
ms.date: 05/31/2018</h2>
<h1>Appending One File to Another File</h1>
<p>The code example in this topic shows you how to open and close files, read and write to files, and lock and unlock files.</p>
<p>In the example, the application appends one file to the end of another file. First, the application opens the file being appended with permissions that allow only the application to write to it. However, during the append process other processes can open the file with read-only permission, which provides a snapshot view of the file being appended. Then, the file is locked during the actual append process to ensure the integrity of the data being written to the file.</p>
<p>This example does not use transactions. If you were using transacted operations, you would only be able have read-only access. In this case, you would only see the appended data after the transaction commit operation completed.</p>
<p>The example also shows that the application opens two files by using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>One.txt is opened for reading.</li>
<li>Two.txt is opened for writing and shared reading.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the application uses <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-readfile"><strong>ReadFile</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-writefile"><strong>WriteFile</strong></a> to append the contents of One.txt to the end of Two.txt by reading and writing the 4 KB blocks. However, before writing to the second file, the application uses <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-setfilepointer"><strong>SetFilePointer</strong></a> to set the pointer of the second file to the end of that file, and uses <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-lockfile"><strong>LockFile</strong></a> to lock the area to be written. This prevents another thread or process with a duplicate handle from accessing the area while the write operation is in progress. When each write operation is complete, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-unlockfile"><strong>UnlockFile</strong></a> is used to unlock the locked area.</p>

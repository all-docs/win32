<td><a href="direct3d-9ex-improvements.html">Direct3D 9Ex Improvements</a></td>
<td>Describes Windows 7's newly added support for Flip Mode Present and its associated Present Statistics in Direct3D 9Ex and Desktop Window Manager. Target applications include video or framerate-based presentation applications. Applications using Direct3D 9Ex Flip Mode Present reduce the system resource load when DWM is enabled. Present Statistics enhancements associated with Flip Mode Present enable Direct3D 9Ex applications to better control the rate of presentation by providing real-time feedback and correction mechanisms. Detailed explanations and pointers to sample resources are included.</td>

<td><a href="surface-sharing-between-windows-graphics-apis.html">Surface Sharing Between Windows Graphics APIs</a></td>
<td>Provides a technical overview of interoperability using surface sharing between Windows graphics APIs, including Direct3D 11, Direct2D, Direct3D 10, and Direct3D 9Ex. If you already have a working knowledge of these APIs, this paper can help you use multiple APIs to render to the same surface in an application designed for the Windows 7 or Windows Vista operating systems. This topic also provides best practice guidelines and pointers to additional resources.</td>

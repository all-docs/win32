<h1>Named Pipes</h1>
<p>A <em>named pipe</em> is a named, one-way or duplex pipe for communication between the pipe server and one or more pipe clients. All instances of a named pipe share the same pipe name, but each instance has its own buffers and handles, and provides a separate conduit for client/server communication. The use of instances enables multiple pipe clients to use the same named pipe simultaneously.</p>
<p>Any process can access named pipes, subject to security checks, making named pipes an easy form of communication between related or unrelated processes.</p>
<p>Any process can act as both a server and a client, making peer-to-peer communication possible. As used here, the term pipe server refers to a process that creates a named pipe, and the term pipe client refers to a process that connects to an instance of a named pipe. The server-side function for instantiating a named pipe is <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-createnamedpipea"><strong>CreateNamedPipe</strong></a>. The server-side function for accepting a connection is <a href="/windows/win32/api/namedpipeapi/nf-namedpipeapi-connectnamedpipe"><strong>ConnectNamedPipe</strong></a>. A client process connects to a named pipe by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-callnamedpipea"><strong>CallNamedPipe</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>Named pipes can be used to provide communication between processes on the same computer or between processes on different computers across a network. If the server service is running, all named pipes are accessible remotely. If you intend to use a named pipe locally only, deny access to NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK or switch to local RPC.</p>

<h1>About Pipes</h1>
<p>There are two types of pipes: <a href="anonymous-pipes.html">anonymous pipes</a> and <a href="named-pipes.html">named pipes</a>. Anonymous pipes require less overhead than named pipes, but offer limited services.</p>
<p>The term pipe, as used here, implies that a pipe is used as an information conduit. Conceptually, a pipe has two ends. A one-way pipe allows the process at one end to write to the pipe, and allows the process at the other end to read from the pipe. A two-way (or duplex) pipe allows a process to read and write from its end of the pipe.</p>

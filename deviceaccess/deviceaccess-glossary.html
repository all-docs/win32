<h1>Device Access Glossary</h1>
<p>The following are terms used throughout the documentation for the Device Access API.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>AppContainer</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A highly restricted execution environment in which a process runs with a reduced subset of the user's privileges. A process that's running within an AppContainer is called an AppContainer process. An AppContainer process is isolated from other AppContainer processes and from the user's profile. It has limited access to a very small subset of system resources like files, devices, registry keys, interprocess communication (IPC)/remote procedure call (RPC) endpoints, and network resources.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Binding</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Associating a device access object with a particular device interface. If binding is successful, Windows Store apps can use the device access object as a broker to communicate with the device driver.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Broker</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A component that provides access to a resource that isn't granted by default.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>Privileged App</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>An app that's identified in a particular device's metadata as associated with that device, so that it can communicate with the device driver's restricted interface. An example of such an app might be a proprietary music playback app that has exclusive permission to sync with a portable music player, when apps from competitors can't. For more information about how to set a device's metadata or how to restrict a driver to privileged apps, see <a href="/windows-hardware/drivers/devapps/uwp-device-apps-for-specialized-devices">UWP device apps for internal devices</a>.</p>

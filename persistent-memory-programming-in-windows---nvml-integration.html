<h1>Persistent Memory Programming in Windows - NVML Integration</h1>
<p>Persistent memory (PM) technology provides byte-level access to non-volatile media while also reducing the latency of storing or retrieving data significantly. It creates a new tier between a systemâ€™s memory and traditional storage. Any program that is dependent on or scales with quick writes to a persistent medium can benefit from PM.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to outline how the non-volatile memory library (NVML) can be integrated into a Visual Studio project for easy use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Persistent Memory is sometimes also referred to as Storage Class Memory (SCM).</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>PM and NVML</h2>
<p>First support for persistent memory was introduced in Windows Server 2016 and the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (1607). For a quick overview, check out these two Channel9 videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/P466">Using Non-volatile Memory (NVDIMM-N) as Block Storage in Windows Server 2016</a></li>
<li><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/P470">Using Non-volatile Memory (NVDIMM-N) as Byte-Addressable Storage in Windows Server 2016</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To help developers take advantage of the benefits persistent memory offers, Microsoft has also contributed to the efforts of bringing the non-volatile memory library (NVML) to Windows. This library provides various tools to make applications persistent-memory aware. For example, it contains code that lets you easily create a PM-aware key-value store for extremely fast look-ups and stores. You can find more information on NVML, including samples, at <a href="https://pmem.io/nvml/">NVM Library</a>.</p>
<h2>Integrating NVML into a Visual Studio Project</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download NVML library files and headers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>NVML is maintained on GitHub. You can either compile the source yourself, or just download compiled binaries directly from here: <a href="https://github.com/pmem/pmdk/releases/tag/1.2%2Bwtp1">NVML Version 1.2 - Windows Technical Preview</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Place the library files and headers in a directory of your choosing, for example: â€œC:\NVML\libâ€ and â€œC:\NVML\incâ€ respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your project as follows:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Open your visual studio project and in the â€œSolution Explorerâ€ right-click on your projectâ€™s name.</li>
<li>Open the projectâ€™s setting pane at the bottom of the resulting pop-up.</li>
<li>Navigate to â€œConfiguration Properties -&gt; C/C++â€ and add the folder in which you stored the header (C:\NVML\inc) to the â€œAdditional Include Directoriesâ€ field.</li>
<li>Next, navigate to â€œConfiguration Properties -&gt; Linkerâ€ and add the folder in which you stored the library (C:\NVML\lib) to the â€œAdditional Library Directoriesâ€ field</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Next, make sure you target the project for Windows Server 2016 or Windows 10 Anniversary Update:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to â€œConfiguration Properties -&gt; Generalâ€ and set the â€œTarget Platform Versionâ€ field to â€œ10.0.14393.0â€ and</li>
<li>Navigate to â€œConfiguration Properties -&gt; C/C++â€ and add â€œNTDDI_VERSION=NTDDI_WIN10_RS1;â€ to the â€œPreprocessorâ€ field.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Include the headers in your code and link to the required libraries</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>At this point, you can simply include the header files you are looking to use in your code like any other header files. For example, to use libpmem:
<ul>
<li>add &quot;#include <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; and</li>
<li>add &quot;libpmem.lib&quot; to &quot;Configuration Properties -&gt; Linker -&gt; Input -&gt; Additional Dependencies&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point you are ready to call the libraryâ€™s functions directly in your code and take advantage of them.</p>

<h1>Property Pages and Property Sheets</h1>
<p>OLE property pages enable an object to display its properties in a tabbed dialog box known as a property sheet. An end user can then view and change the object's properties. An object can display its property pages independent of its client, or the client can manage the display of property pages from a number of contained objects in a single property sheet. Property pages also provide a means for notifying a client of changes in an object's properties.</p>
<p>Any object that wants to provide a user interface for its changing properties can use this technology.</p>

<h1>Keyboard Handling in Controls</h1>
<p>Keyboard handling support for the following functionality is strongly recommended, although it is recognized that it is not applicable to all containers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for OLEMISC_ACTSLIKELABEL and OLEMISC_ACTSLIKEBUTTON status bits.</li>
<li>Implementing the DisplayAsDefault ambient property (if it exists, it can return <strong>FALSE</strong>).</li>
<li>Implementing tab handling, including tab order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some containers will use ActiveX controls in traditional compound document scenarios. For example, a spreadsheet may allow a user to embed an ActiveX control into a worksheet. In such scenarios, the container would do keyboard handling differently, because the keyboard interface should remain consistent with the user's expectations of a spreadsheet. Documentation for such products should inform users of differences in control handling in these different scenarios. Other containers should endeavor to honor the above functionality correctly, including Mnemonic handling.</p>

<h1>Properties and Methods</h1>
<p>Like any OLE object, a control provides much of its functionality through a set of incoming interfaces with properties and methods.</p>
<p>A control exposes properties and methods through OLE automation so that containers can access them under the control of a container-supplied programming language.</p>
<p>To support access to properties through a user interface, a control provides property pages, support for OLEIVERB_PROPERTIES, per property browsing, and data binding through property change notifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through property pages a control can display its properties, independent of its container, if necessary.</li>
<li>By supporting OLEIVERB_PROPERTIES, the Properties item is displayed on the container's menu. Then, the end user can select the <strong>Properties</strong> item to view the control's property pages and modify the properties.</li>
<li>Per property browsing supports a container that can display the control's properties as part of a larger property sheet that may include properties from several controls in the container.</li>
<li>Through property change notification, a control can notify a client that its properties have change, allowing the client to take any necessary actions as a result.</li>
</ul>

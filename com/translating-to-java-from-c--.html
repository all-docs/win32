<h1>Translating to Java from C++</h1>
<p>Using the C++ programming language, developers can directly access the memory that stores a particular variable. Memory pointers provide this direct access. In Java, pointers are handled for you.</p>
<p>In Java, <strong>struct</strong>, <strong>union</strong>, and <strong>typedef</strong> composite data types are handled exclusively through the use of classes. For example, the C++ <strong>VARIANT</strong> data type maps to <strong>com.ms.com.Variant</strong> in Java.</p>
<p>In C++, strings are an array of characters. In Java, strings are objects. Methods that act on strings treat the string as a complete object.</p>
<p>COM methods return a value known as a <strong>HRESULT</strong>, which is a 32-bit error code. The Java support for Microsoft Internet Explorer defines a class, <strong>com.ms.com.ComException</strong>, which wraps the <strong>HRESULT</strong> error code.</p>
<p>Java does not support unsigned data types except for <strong>char</strong>, which is a 16-bit unsigned integer. Methods that accept or return other unsigned data types cannot be used from Java.</p>
<p>Java does not support multidimensional arrays. Methods that accept or return multidimensional arrays are not available from Java.</p>
<p>Boolean values in Java cannot be cast to 0 and 1.</p>

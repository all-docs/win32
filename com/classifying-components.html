<h1>Classifying Components</h1>
<p>While a client is able to browse through the list of CLSIDs in the registry and select a component to use, loading each component in the registry and querying it for its supported interfaces is very time-consuming. To determine whether a component supports the interfaces required before creating an instance of the component, a method to classify components into categories was developed.</p>
<p>A component category is a set of interfaces that have been assigned a GUID named CATID. Components that implement all of the interfaces in a component category register themselves as members of that component category. Components that belong to a certain component category can then be selected from the registry. By registering itself as a member of a component category, the component is guaranteeing that it supports all of the member interfaces in the component category.</p>
<p>A component can be a member of many categories. It is not limited to supporting interfaces in a component category. It can support any interface, in addition to those in a component category.</p>
<p>In contrast to the standard registration of components, in which developers must write code that manually registers objects, component categories automates much of this work. The six methods of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComCat/nn-comcat-icatregister"><strong>ICatRegister</strong></a> interface define component categories and register objects that implement or require them. The <a href="the-component-categories-manager.html">Component Categories Manager</a> object implements this interface. See <strong>ICatRegister</strong> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ComCat/nn-comcat-icatinformation"><strong>ICatInformation</strong></a> for additional information on using component categories.</p>

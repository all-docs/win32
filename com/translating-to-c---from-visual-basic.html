<h1>Translating to C++ from Visual Basic</h1>
<p>Visual Basic handles pointers implicitly. In C++, your application is responsible for performing any necessary pointer arithmetic.</p>
<p>By default, Visual Basic passes parameters by reference (as pointers). Parameters that are meant to be passed by value only are specified by the keyword <strong>ByVal</strong>. For example, a <strong>ByVal</strong>Ã‚Â <strong>Integer</strong> parameter in Visual Basic is equivalent to a <strong>short</strong> parameter in C++, whereas a <strong>ByRef</strong>Ã‚Â <strong>Integer</strong> parameter in Visual Basic is equivalent to a <strong>short*</strong> parameter.</p>
<p>A parameter that is declared <strong>As String</strong> in Visual Basic is declared as a pointer to a <strong>BSTR</strong> in C++. Setting a string pointer to <strong>NULL</strong> in C++ is equivalent to setting the string to the <strong>vbNullString</strong> constant in Visual Basic. Passing a zero-length string (&quot;&quot;) to a function designed to receive <strong>NULL</strong> does not work, because this passes a pointer to a zero-length string instead of a zero pointer.</p>
<p>C++ and Visual Basic differ slightly in how they represent properties. In C++, properties are represented as a set of accessor functions, one that sets the property value and one that retrieves the property value. In Visual Basic, properties are represented as a single item that can be used to retrieve or set the property value.</p>

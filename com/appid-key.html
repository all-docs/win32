<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>AppIDs are mapped to executables and classes using two different mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using a 128-bit Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) that identifies the <strong>AppID</strong> key. A class indicates its corresponding AppID under the <a href="clsid-key-hklm.html"><strong>CLSID</strong></a> key in a named value &quot;AppID&quot;. This mapping is used during activation.</li>
<li>Using a named value that indicates an executable name (such as &quot;MYOLDAPP.EXE&quot;). This named value is of type <strong>REG_SZ</strong> and contains the string representation of the AppID associated with the executable. This mapping is used to obtain the default access permissions and authentication level.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes</strong> key corresponds to the <strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</strong> key, which was retained for compatibility with earlier versions of COM.</p>
<p>For COM servers, the mapping is usually generated and written to the registry during the registration process or when running dcomcnfg.exe. However, COM clients that want to set security using the <strong>AppID</strong> key must create appropriate registry keys and specify the required mapping by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/SysInfo/registry-functions">registry functions</a> or using Regedit.exe. Then values such as <a href="accesspermission.html"><strong>AccessPermission</strong></a> or <a href="authenticationlevel.html"><strong>AuthenticationLevel</strong></a> can be set for the client. For example, suppose the name of your executable for your client process is &quot;YourClient.exe&quot; and you want to set the authentication level to &quot;None&quot;. You would use Guidgen.exe or Uuidgen.exe to create the GUID that is the AppID for your executable. Then you would set values in the registry as shown in the following example, where 00000001 represents an authentication level of &quot;None&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID
Â Â Â {MyGuid}
Â Â Â Â Â Â AuthenticationLevel = 00000001
Â Â Â MyClient.exe
Â Â Â Â Â Â AppID = {MyGUID}
</code></pre>

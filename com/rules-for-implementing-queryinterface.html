<h1>Rules for Implementing QueryInterface</h1>
<p>There are three main rules that govern implementing the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)"><strong>IUnknown::QueryInterface</strong></a> method on a COM object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects must have identity.</li>
<li>The set of interfaces on an object instance must be static.</li>
<li>It must be possible to query successfully for any interface on an object from any other interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Objects Must Have Identity</h2>
<p>For any given object instance, a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)"><strong>QueryInterface</strong></a> with IID_IUnknown must always return the same physical pointer value. This allows you to call <strong>QueryInterface</strong> on any two interfaces and compare the results to determine whether they point to the same instance of an object.</p>
<h2>The Set of Interfaces on an Object Instance Must Be Static</h2>
<p>The set of interfaces accessible on an object through <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)"><strong>QueryInterface</strong></a> must be static, not dynamic. Specifically, if <strong>QueryInterface</strong> returns S_OK for a given IID once, it must never return E_NOINTERFACE on subsequent calls on the same object; and if <strong>QueryInterface</strong> returns E_NOINTERFACE for a given IID, subsequent calls for the same IID on the same object must never return S_OK.</p>
<h2>It Must Be Possible to Query Successfully for Any Interface on an Object from Any Other Interface</h2>
<p>That is, given the following code:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>IA * pA = (some function returning an IA *); 
IB * pB = NULL; 
HRESULT   hr; 
hr = pA-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IB, &amp;pB); 
 
</code></pre>
<p>the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have a pointer to an interface on an object, a call like the following to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)"><strong>QueryInterface</strong></a> for that same interface must succeed:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>pA-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IA, ...) 
 
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-queryinterface(q)"><strong>QueryInterface</strong></a> for a second interface pointer succeeds, a call to <strong>QueryInterface</strong> from that pointer for the first interface must also succeed. If pB was successfully obtained, the following must also succeed:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>pB-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IA, ...) 
 
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any interface must be able to query for any other interface on an object. If pB was successfully obtained and you successfully query for a third interface (IC) using that pointer, you must also be able to query successfully for IC using the first pointer, pA. In this case, the following sequence must succeed:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>IC * pC = NULL; 
hr = pB-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IC, &amp;pC); 
pA-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IC, ...) 
 
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interface implementations must maintain a counter of outstanding pointer references to all the interfaces on a given object. You should use an <strong>unsigned integer</strong> for the counter.</p>
<p>If a client needs to know that resources have been freed, it must use a method in some interface on the object with higher-level semantics before calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release"><strong>IUnknown::Release</strong></a>.</p>

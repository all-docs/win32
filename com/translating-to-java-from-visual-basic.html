<h1>Translating to Java from Visual Basic</h1>
<p>By default, Visual Basic passes parameters by reference. Parameters that are meant to be passed by value only are specified by the keyword <strong>ByVal</strong>.</p>
<p>Java does not support multidimensional arrays. Methods that accept or return multidimensional arrays are not available from Java.</p>
<p>Java and Visual Basic differ slightly in how they represent properties. In Java, properties are represented as a set of accessor functions, one that sets the property value and one that retrieves the property value. In Visual Basic, properties are represented as a single item that can be used to retrieve or set the property value.</p>

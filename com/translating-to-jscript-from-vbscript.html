<h1>Translating to JScript from VBScript</h1>
<p>In VBScript, the <strong>For</strong>...<strong>Each</strong> loop enumerates the members of a collection; in JScript, the <strong>for</strong>...<strong>in</strong> loop enumerates the members of a JScript object or array. To enumerate a collection in JScript, use an Enumerator object.</p>
<p>In JScript, there are several data types such as numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, and the null attribute. VBScript only uses one data type, <strong>Variant</strong>, which can be subtyped to represent strings, numbers, Booleans, and so on.</p>
<p>In JScript, arrays can be expanded dynamically by setting a new value for the array's length property. In VBScript, arrays cannot be enlarged; they must be redimensioned using the <strong>redim</strong> statement.</p>
<p>Both VBScript and JScript support functions. VBScript, however, also supports subroutines. Subroutines are similar to functions but do not return a value.</p>
<p>JScript is case-sensitive. VBScript is not.</p>
<p>JScript is supported by both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. Netscape Navigator does not support VBScript.</p>
<p>JScript provides the Error object, which can be used to trap and handle errors. The Error object is analogous to the VBScript Err object.</p>
<p>JScript arrays are not arrays of the variable type <strong>VARIANT SAFEARRAY</strong>. If your script receives a <strong>VARIANT SAFEARRAY</strong> variable from a COM object or VBScript script, it must use a VBArray object to access the <strong>VARIANT SAFEARRAY</strong> variable.</p>

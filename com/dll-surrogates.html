<h1>DLL Surrogates</h1>
<p>COM makes it possible to create DLL servers that can be loaded into a surrogate EXE process. This combines the ease of writing DLL servers with the benefits of executable implementation. Development tools like Microsoft Visual Studio facilitate the writing of DLL servers, but a DLL server in itself has limits. Running the DLL server in a surrogate process offers several possible benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fault isolation and the ability to service multiple clients simultaneously.</li>
<li>In a distributed environment, a DLL server implementation could be used to service remote clients.</li>
<li>It could permit clients to help protect themselves from untrusted server code while allowing them access to the services the DLL server provides.</li>
<li>Running a DLL server in a surrogate provides the DLL with the surrogate's security.</li>
</ul>
<p>COM provides a default surrogate process, or you can write a custom surrogate if you have special needs.</p>

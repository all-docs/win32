<h1>Changes to COM in Windows Vista</h1>
<p>The following changes were made to COM in WindowsÂ Vista:</p>
<ul>
<li>The COM elevation moniker allows applications that are running under a limited user account (LUA) to activate COM classes with elevated functionality. For more information, please see <a href="the-com-elevation-moniker.html">The COM Elevation Moniker</a>.</li>
<li>When you install an application that makes COM calls on a Windows Vista computer, and you plan to run the application as an administrator, you must install the application per-machine, rather than per-user, or it will not function properly.</li>
</ul>

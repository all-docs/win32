<h1>Insertable (CLSID Key)</h1>
<p>Indicates that objects of this class should appear in the <strong>Insert Object</strong> dialog box list box when used by COM container applications.</p>
<h2>Registry Entry</h2>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID
Â Â Â {CLSID}
Â Â Â Â Â Â Insertable
</code></pre>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>This key is a required entry for 32-bit COM applications whose objects can be inserted into existing 16-bit applications. Existing 16-bit applications look in the registry for this key, which informs the application that the server supports embeddings. If the <strong>Insertable</strong> key exists, 16-bit applications may also attempt to verify that the server exists on the machine. 16-bit applications typically retrieve the value of the <a href="localserver.html"><strong>LocalServer</strong></a> key from the class and check to see whether it is a valid file on the system. Therefore, for a 32-bit application to be insertable by a 16-bit application, the 32-bit application should register the <strong>LocalServer</strong> subkey in addition to registering <a href="localserver32.html"><strong>LocalServer32</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Used with controls, this entry indicates that an object can act only as an in-place embedded object with no special control features. Objects that have this key appear in the <strong>Insert Object</strong> dialog box for their container. When used with controls, this entry also indicates the control has been tested with non-control containers. This entry is also optional and can be omitted when a control is not designed to work with older containers that do not understand controls.</p>

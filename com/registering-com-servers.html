<h1>Registering COM Servers</h1>
<p>After you have defined a class in code (ensuring that it implements <a href="/windows/win32/api/unknwn/nn-unknwn-iclassfactory"><strong>IClassFactory</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/OCIdl/nn-ocidl-iclassfactory2"><strong>IClassFactory2</strong></a>) and assigned it a CLSID, you need to put information in the registry that will allow COM, on request of a client with the CLSID, to create instances of its objects. This information tells the system, for a given CLSID, where the DLL or EXE code for that class is located and how it is to be launched.</p>
<p>There is more than one way of registering a class in the registry. In addition, there are other ways of &quot;registering&quot; a class with the system when it is running, so that the system is aware that a running object is currently in the system.</p>

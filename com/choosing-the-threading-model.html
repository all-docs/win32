<h1>Choosing the Threading Model</h1>
<p>Choosing the threading model for an object depends on the object's function. An object that does extensive I/O might support free-threading to provide maximum response to clients by allowing interface calls during I/O latency. On the other hand, an object that interacts with the user might support apartment threading to synchronize incoming COM calls with its window operations.</p>
<p>It is easier to support apartment threading in single-threaded apartments because COM provides synchronization on a per-call basis. Supporting free-threading is more difficult because the object must implement synchronization; however, response to clients may be better because synchronization can be implemented for smaller sections of code.</p>

<h1>Setting Process-Wide Security</h1>
<p>There are several ways to set process-wide security. The first way, using the Dcomcnfg.exe tool, is easiest because it requires no programming. The second technique offers the programmer more control, and it requires a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity"><strong>CoInitializeSecurity</strong></a>. Another technique is to set process-wide security in the registry by using the <a href="appid-key.html">AppID</a> key.</p>
<p>For more information about these techniques, see the following topics:</p>

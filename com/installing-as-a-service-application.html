<h1>Installing as a Service Application</h1>
<p>In addition to running as a local server executable (EXE), a COM object may also package itself to run as a service application when activated by a local or remote client. Services support numerous useful and user interfaceÃ¢â‚¬â€œintegrated administrative features, including local and remote starting, stopping, pausing, and restarting, as well as the ability to establish the server to run under a specific <a href="/windows/desktop/Services/service-user-accounts">user account</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/winstation/window-stations">window station</a>.</p>
<p>An object written as a service is installed for use by COM by establishing a <a href="localservice.html">LocalService</a> value under its <a href="appid-key.html">AppID</a> key and performing a standard service installation.</p>
<p>Classes may also be configured to run under a specific user account when activated by a remote client without being written as a service application. To do this, the class installs a user name and a password to be used when the SCM launches its local server process.</p>
<p>When a class is configured in this fashion, calls to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coregisterclassobject"><strong>CoRegisterClassObject</strong></a> with this CLSID will fail unless the process was launched by COM on behalf of an actual activation request. In other words, classes configured to run as a particular user may not be registered under any other identity.</p>
<p>The user name is taken from the <a href="runas.html">RunAs</a> named-value under the class's APPID key. If the user name is &quot;Interactive User&quot;, the class code is run in the security context of the currently logged on user and is connected to the interactive window station.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the password is retrieved from a hidden portion of the registry available only to administrators of the machine and to the system. The user name and password are then used to create a logon session in which the class code is run. When launched in this way, the class code runs with its own desktop and window-station and does not share window handles, the clipboard, or other user interface elements with the interactive user or other classes running in other user accounts.</p>
<p>A server registered either with <strong>LocalService</strong> or <strong>RunAs</strong> can register an object in the running object table to allow any client to connect to it. To do so, the server's call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/ObjIdl/nf-objidl-irunningobjecttable-register"><strong>IRunningObjectTable::Register</strong></a> must set the ROTFLAGS_ALLOWANYCLIENT flag. A server setting this bit must have its executable name in the AppID section of the registry that refers to the AppID for the executable. An &quot;activate as activator&quot; server (not registered as either <strong>LocalService</strong> or <strong>RunAs</strong>) may not register an object with this flag.</p>

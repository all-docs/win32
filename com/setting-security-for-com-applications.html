<h1>Setting Security for COM Applications</h1>
<p>There are several ways you can help control security for your applications. You can change a computer's default security settings, which are used by all applications on the computer that do not supply their own security values. You can set security for a particular process, either by using Dcomcnfg.exe or by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity"><strong>CoInitializeSecurity</strong></a>. You can also programmatically control security settings at the interface proxy level.</p>
<p>The following topics provide procedures that explain how to set security:</p>

<h1>Event Freezing</h1>
<p>A container can notify a control that it is not ready to respond to events by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/OCIdl/nf-ocidl-iolecontrol-freezeevents"><strong>IOleControl::FreezeEvents</strong></a> with <strong>TRUE</strong>. It can unfreeze the events by calling <strong>FreezeEvents</strong> with <strong>FALSE</strong>. When a container freezes events, it is freezing event processing, not event receiving; that is, a container can still receive events while events are frozen. If a container receives an event notification while its events are frozen, the container should ignore the event. No other action is appropriate.</p>
<p>A control should take note of a container's call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/OCIdl/nf-ocidl-iolecontrol-freezeevents"><strong>FreezeEvents</strong></a> with <strong>TRUE</strong> if it is important to the control that an event is not missed. While a container's event processing is frozen, a control should implement one of the following techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire the events in the full knowledge that the container will take no action.</li>
<li>Discard all events that the control would have fired.</li>
<li>Queue up all pending events and fire them after the container has called <a href="/windows/desktop/api/OCIdl/nf-ocidl-iolecontrol-freezeevents"><strong>FreezeEvents</strong></a> with <strong>FALSE</strong>.</li>
<li>Queue up only relevant or important events and fire them after the container has called <a href="/windows/desktop/api/OCIdl/nf-ocidl-iolecontrol-freezeevents"><strong>FreezeEvents</strong></a> with <strong>FALSE</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each technique is acceptable and appropriate in different circumstances. The control developer is responsible for determining and implementing the appropriate technique for the control's functionality.</p>

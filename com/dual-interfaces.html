<h1>Dual Interfaces</h1>
<p>OLE Automation enables an object to expose a set of methods in two ways: via the <strong>IDispatch</strong> interface, and through direct OLE VTable binding. <strong>IDispatch</strong> is used by most tools available today, and offers support for late binding to properties and methods.</p>
<p>VTable binding offers much higher performance because this method is called directly instead of through <strong>IDispatch::Invoke</strong>. <strong>IDispatch</strong> offers late bound support, where direct VTable binding offers a significant performance gain; both techniques are valuable and important in different scenarios. By labeling an interface as [<a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/dual"><strong>dual</strong></a>] in the type library, an OLE Automation interface can be used either via <strong>IDispatch</strong>, or it can be bound to directly. Containers can thus choose the most appropriate technique. Support for dual interfaces is strongly recommended for both controls and containers.</p>

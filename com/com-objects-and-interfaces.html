<h1>COM Objects and Interfaces</h1>
<p>COM is a technology that allows objects to interact across process and computer boundaries as easily as within a single process. COM enables this by specifying that the only way to manipulate the data associated with an object is through an <em>interface</em> on the object. When this term is used in this documentation, it refers to an implementation in code of a COM binary-compliant interface that is associated with an object.</p>
<p>COM uses the word <em>interface</em> in a sense different from that typically used in Visual C++ programming. A C++ interface refers to all of the functions that a class supports and that clients of an object can call to interact with it. A COM interface refers to a predefined group of related functions that a COM class implements, but a specific interface does not necessarily represent all the functions that the class supports.</p>
<p>Referring to an object <em>implementing</em> an interface means that the object uses code that implements each method of the interface and provides COM binary-compliant pointers to those functions to the COM library. COM then makes those functions available to any client who asks for a pointer to the interface, whether the client is inside or outside of the process that implements those functions.</p>

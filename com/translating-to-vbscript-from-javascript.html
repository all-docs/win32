<h1>Translating to VBScript from JavaScript</h1>
<p>In JavaScript, there are several data types, such as numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, and the null attribute. VBScript only uses one data type, <strong>Variant</strong>, which can be subtyped to represent strings, numbers, Booleans, and so on.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, arrays can be expanded dynamically by setting a new value for the array's length property. In VBScript, arrays cannot be enlarged; they must be redimensioned using the <strong>redim</strong> statement.</p>
<p>Both VBScript and JavaScript support functions. VBScript, however, also supports subroutines. Subroutines are similar to functions, except they do not return a value.</p>
<p>JavaScript is case-sensitive. VBScript is not.</p>
<p>JavaScript is supported by a wide variety of Web browsers, including both Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. Netscape Navigator does not support VBScript.</p>
<p>VBScript supports error handling through its Err object. JavaScript does not currently provide a means of trapping and handling errors.</p>

<h1>Customizing Icons</h1>
<p>Windows supplies default icons for every item displayed on the desktop and in Windows Explorer. Mass storage devices, such as disk drives, are also assigned default icons. However, these icons often provide little insight to the user as to the contents of the file or what program is associated with it. You can assign a custom icon to a file system folder by creating a <a href="how-to-customize-folders-with-desktop-ini.html">Desktop.ini</a> file. See the following documents to learn how to use the registry to associate custom icons with file types and drive letters.</p>

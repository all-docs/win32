<h1>How to Exclude an Application from the Open With Dialog Box for Unassociated File Types</h1>
<p>When a user attempts to open a file that is not a member of any registered file type (that is, an unknown file type), or when a user selects <strong>Open with</strong> or <strong>Open with -&gt; Choose default program</strong> from a file's shortcut menu, the Shell presents a submenu or dialog box that enables the user to specify the program used to open the file.</p>
<p>By default, any application registered as a subkey of <strong>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</strong>\<strong>Applications</strong> is presented in the <strong>Open with</strong> dialog box. These applications are presented in <strong>Open with</strong> regardless of whether the application is registered to handle the file type.</p>
<p>To prevent an application from appearing in the <strong>Open with</strong> dialog box when the application should not or cannot be used to open certain file types, use one of the two techniques described in this topic.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>Add a NoOpenWith entry to the application's subkey. When an application uses a file type, Windows records that information to build the <strong>Recommended Programs</strong> list. This list is presented in the <strong>Open with</strong> submenu as shown in the following screen shot.</p>
<p><img src="images/file-assoc/openwithsubmenu.png" alt="screen shot of shortcut menu with the open with submenu shown" /></p>
<p>These recommended applications are also shown in the <strong>Recommended Programs</strong> portion of the <strong>Open with</strong> dialog box as shown in the following screen shot.</p>
<p><img src="images/file-assoc/openwithdialog.png" alt="screen shot of the open with dialog box with recommended programs" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If an application has registered itself in the <a href="fa-file-types.html">OpenWithList</a> or OpenWithProgIDs for the file type, it will appear in the <strong>Recommended Programs</strong> list even if the NoOpenWith entry is set. Also, remember that regardless of whether an application is offered in a list of recommended programs, a user can manually browse to any executable file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Applications can disable this tracking by specifying a NoOpenWith value under the application's subkey.</p>
<p>The NoOpenWith entry is an empty <strong>REG_SZ</strong> value as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
Â Â Â Applications
Â Â Â Â Â Â MyProgram.exe
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â NoOpenWith
</code></pre>
<p>Setting the NoOpenWith entry also has these effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents pinning a file to the application's Jump List through drag-and-drop, unless the application is specifically registered to handle that file type.</li>
<li>Prevents the common file dialog box and any call to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/nf-shlobj_core-shaddtorecentdocs"><strong>SHAddToRecentDocs</strong></a> function from adding any file to the application's Jump List, unless the application is specifically registered to handle that file type.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2:</h3>
<p>The second way to prevent an application from appearing in the <strong>Open with</strong> dialog box is to use the <strong>SupportedTypes</strong> subkey to explicitly list the extensions of file types that the application can open. This prevents the application from appearing in the <strong>Open with</strong> dialog box for file types that it cannot open. It also causes the application to appear in the <strong>Recommended Programs</strong> list as discussed previously.</p>
<p>This method is particularly useful if an application can save a file as a certain file type but cannot open that file type. An application should also set the FOS_DONTADDTORECENT flag through <a href="/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-ifiledialog-setoptions"><strong>IFileDialog::SetOptions</strong></a> when calling the <strong>Save</strong> dialog box. This keeps the item from being added to the <strong>Recent</strong> or <strong>Frequent</strong> portions of a Jump List. It also blocks the application from being tracked under <a href="fa-file-types.html">OpenWithList</a>.</p>
<p>Each supported extension is added as an entry under the <strong>SupportedTypes</strong> subkey as shown in the following example. The entries are of type <strong>REG_SZ</strong> or <strong>REG_NULL</strong>, with no associated values.</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
Â Â Â Applications
Â Â Â Â Â Â ApplicationName
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SupportedTypes
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â .ext1
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â .ext2
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â .ext3
</code></pre>
<p>If a <strong>SupportedTypes</strong> subkey is provided, only files with those extensions are eligible for pinning to the application's Jump List or for being tracked in an application's <strong>Recent</strong> or <strong>Frequent</strong> destinations list.</p>
<p>The NoOpenWith entry overrides the <strong>SupportedTypes</strong> subkey and hides the application in the <strong>Open with</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p>Â </p>

<h1>About Synchronization Manager</h1>
<p>The Synchronization Manager provides a centralized, standard technology for synchronizing files for offline use on a local computer. The user can prepare a computer for offline use by updating the needed files from the network storage. Then, when the computer is brought back online, any offline changes can be copied back to the network. SyncMgr provides a common user interface that all applications can share for synchronizing their files.</p>
<p>Files are transferred independent of the protocol. For example, an email program can transfer its messages using SMTP, NMTP, or POP3, while a browser can use HTTP and a database can use RPC. The protocol is transparent to the SyncMgr.</p>
<p>SyncMgr is also storage independent and can transfer files, email messages, HTML pages, or database information transparently.</p>

<h1>How to Suppress and Control Verb Visibility</h1>
<p>This topic tells you how to control verb visibility.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>You can use Windows policy settings to control verb visibility. Verbs can be suppressed through policy settings by adding a <strong>SuppressionPolicy</strong> subkey or a <strong>SuppressionPolicyEx</strong> GUID value to the verb's registry subkey. Set the value of the <strong>SuppressionPolicy</strong> subkey to the policy ID. If the policy is turned on, the verb and its associated shortcut menu entry are suppressed. For possible policy ID values, see the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shlobj_core/ne-shlobj_core-restrictions"><strong>RESTRICTIONS</strong></a> enumeration.</p>

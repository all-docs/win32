<h1>Creating an AutoRun-enabled CD-ROM Application</h1>
<p>AutoRun is a feature of the Windows operating system. It automates the procedures for installing and configuring products designed for Windows-based platforms that are distributed on CD-ROMs. When users insert an AutoRun-enabled compact disc into their CD-ROM drive, AutoRun automatically runs an application on the CD-ROM that installs, configures, or runs the selected product.</p>
<p>AutoRun can be used to install and run CD-ROM applications. Although AutoRun is most commonly used for Windows applications, it can also be used to install, configure, or run MS-DOS-based applications in a Windows Microsoft MS-DOS session. You can configure each MS-DOS-based application with its own unique icon, Config.sys file, and Autoexec.bat file. Windows creates the correct configuration files for the MS-DOS-based application. The startup application then starts the MS-DOS-based application in a window.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
For AutoRun to work, the CD-ROM drive must have 32 or 64-bit device drivers that detect when a user inserts a compact disc and notify the system.</p>

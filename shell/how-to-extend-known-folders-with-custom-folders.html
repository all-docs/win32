<h1>How to Extend Known Folders with Custom Folders</h1>
<p>Independent software vendors (ISVs) can extend the set of known folders on a system by registering known folders of their own. Once registered, those third-party folders are known to the system. They are found by any call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfoldermanager-getfolderids"><strong>IKnownFolderManager::GetFolderIds</strong></a>. Note that a known folder must be a per-machine folder. You cannot create a per-user known folder.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>Define your known folder through a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Shobjidl_core/ns-shobjidl_core-knownfolder_definition"><strong>KNOWNFOLDER_DEFINITION</strong></a> structure.</p>
<h3>Step 2:</h3>
<p>Register the known folder through a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfoldermanager-registerfolder"><strong>IKnownFolderManager::RegisterFolder</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>If you create a known folder for your application as part of your installation procedure, you must also include <a href="/windows/desktop/api/shobjidl_core/nf-shobjidl_core-iknownfoldermanager-unregisterfolder"><strong>IKnownFolderManager::UnregisterFolder</strong></a> as part of your uninstallation code.</p>
<p>Give consideration to why you want your folder to be included in the known folder system before you register it. You should have a valid reason for elevating your folder to that level of system visibility.</p>

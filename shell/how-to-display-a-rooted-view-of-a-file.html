<h1>How to Display a Rooted View of a File</h1>
<p>You can use a namespace extension to allow users to browse the contents of a file rather than have it presented as a folder. Extensions of this sort are typically used to display the contents of the members of a <a href="fa-file-types.html">file type</a>. For instance, the members of a file type might contain multiple compressed files or images, organized in a hierarchy. Rather than write an application to allow the user to view the contents of such a file, you can instead write a namespace extension and let Windows Explorer handle the display.</p>
<p>You must use a rooted view in order to have an extension display the contents of a file. The most common way to provide a rooted view of the members of a file type is to define a <a href="context.html">shortcut menu verb</a> that launches an instance of Explorer.exe. By making this verb the default verb, a double-click will also open a rooted view of the file. You can either define a verb for all members of the file type by <a href="context.html">modifying the registry</a>, or dynamically define verbs on a file-by-file basis by implementing a <a href="context-menu-handlers.html">shortcut menu handler</a>.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>The following example illustrates how to use the registry to provide a rooted view of the members of a file type by modifying the registry. The sample registry entry is a modification of one of the examples in <a href="context.html">Extending Shortcut Menus</a>. The registry entries define files with an .myp file name extension as a file type, and use the <strong>browse</strong> verb to launch a rooted view of members of that type.</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
Â Â Â .myp
Â Â Â Â Â Â (Default) = MyProgram.1
Â Â Â MyProgram.1
Â Â Â Â Â Â (Default) = MyProgram Application
Â Â Â Â Â Â Shell
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Default) = browse
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â browse
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â command
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Default) = %SYSTEMROOT%\explorer.exe /e,/root,{Extension CLSID}, &quot;%1&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the same verb to programmatically launch a rooted view of a member of the file type by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea"><strong>ShellExecute</strong></a> function.</p>

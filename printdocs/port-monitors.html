<h1>Port Monitors</h1>
<p>Once a device driver has converted an entire journal file into raw device commands, the file of converted commands is passed back to the spooler. The spooler sends these low-level commands to a monitor. A port monitor is a .dll that passes the raw device commands over the network, through a parallel port, or through a serial port to the printer device. Custom port monitors can be installed to support passing device data through other communication ports.</p>
<p>Use the following functions to work with port monitors.</p>

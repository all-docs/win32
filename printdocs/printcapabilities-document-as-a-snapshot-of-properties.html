<h1>PrintCapabilities Document as a Snapshot of Properties</h1>
<p>This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip">Print Schema Specification</a>.</p>
<p>The device described by the PrintCapabilities might have properties that depend on the state or configuration of the device. While the PrintCapabilities represents the full configuration space of a device, the PrintCapabilities provider produces a configuration-dependent instance of the PrintCapabilities called the PrintCapabilities document. This configuration-dependent PrintCapabilities document avoids burdening the PrintCapabilities Schema with the complexity of representing multivalued data. More importantly, to relieve a consumer of the PrintCapabilities document from the burden of extracting the appropriate value from a multivalued data representation, all Property and ScoredProperty instances in a PrintCapabilities document are required to be single-valued. In other words, each Property and ScoredProperty instance in a PrintCapabilities document must have a fixed Value, relative to the input configuration. Each PrintCapabilities document can be thought of as a snapshot of the properties of the device when the device is in a particular state. Consequently, before a PrintCapabilities document can be constructed, the configuration to be used must be provided.</p>

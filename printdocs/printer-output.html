<h1>Printer Device Contexts (Documents and Printing)</h1>
<p>Just as an application requires a display device context (DC) before it can begin drawing in the client area of a window, it needs a printer DC before it can begin sending output to a printer. A printer DC is similar to a display DC in that it is an internal data structure that defines a set of graphic objects and their associated attributes and specifies the graphic modes that affect output. The graphic objects include a pen for line drawing, a brush for painting and filling, and a font for text output.</p>
<p>Unlike a display DC, a printer DC is not owned by the window management component, and it cannot be obtained by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getdc"><strong>GetDC</strong></a> function. Instead, an application must call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-createdca"><strong>CreateDC</strong></a> or <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms646942(v=vs.85)"><strong>PrintDlgEx</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>If your application calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-createdca"><strong>CreateDC</strong></a> function, it must supply a driver and port name. To retrieve these names, call the <a href="getprinter.html"><strong>GetPrinter</strong></a> or <a href="enumprinters.html"><strong>EnumPrinters</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>If your application calls the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms646942(v=vs.85)"><strong>PrintDlgEx</strong></a> function and specifies the PD_RETURNDC value in the <strong>Flags</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/commdlg/ns-commdlg-printdlgexa"><strong>PRINTDLGEX</strong></a> structure, the system returns a handle to a device context for the printer selected by the user. For more information, see <a href="../dlgbox/print-property-sheet.html">Print Property Sheet</a> and &quot;Using the Print Property Sheet&quot; in <a href="../dlgbox/using-common-dialog-boxes.html">Using Common Dialog Boxes</a>.</p>

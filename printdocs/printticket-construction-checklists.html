<h1>PrintTicket Construction Checklists</h1>
<p>This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip">Print Schema Specification</a>.</p>
<p>This section demonstrates how the author of a PrintTicket client can use the element types defined in the Print Schema Framework to create a PrintTicket that describes intents for a device. The PrintTicket can be generic (not tied to a specific device), or it can be device-specific. The semantics of the PrintTicket are presented in greater detail. In addition, this section contains an overview of concepts and terminology that are covered in more depth in subsequent sections.</p>
<p>There are two fundamentally different approaches to constructing a PrintTicket. Either approach can be used.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Target the PrintTicket to an unknown or generic device by <a href="creating-a-generic-printticket.html">Creating a Generic PrintTicket</a>.</p>
<p>If your primary objective is to preserve the end user's intent, you might want to take this approach, by constructing and storing an unvalidated generic PrintTicket with the document.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Target the PrintTicket to a specific device, by <a href="creating-a-device-specific-printticket.html">Creating a Device-Specific PrintTicket</a>.</p>
<p>If you are more interested in taking advantage of all of the features offered by a particular device, you might want to take this approach, by constructing a PrintTicket for the specific device and storing the validated PrintTicket with the document.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Printer Escapes</h1>
<p>The printer escapes provided by 16-bit Windows allowed access special device features. Most of these escapes are obsolete, but a few are provided to simplify the porting of 16-bit Windows-based applications. GDI supports a complete set of path functions that applications can use instead of the escapes to draw paths on any device. For a list of functions that replace some of the escapes, see the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-escape"><strong>Escape</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>Of the 64 original printer escapes, only <strong>QUERYESCSUPPORT</strong> and <strong>PASSTHROUGH</strong> can be used.</p>
<p>There is also an extended escape function called <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-extescape"><strong>ExtEscape</strong></a>. This function allows applications to access capabilities of a particular device not directly available through GDI.</p>

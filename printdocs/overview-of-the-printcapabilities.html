<h1>Overview of the PrintCapabilities</h1>
<p>This topic is not current. For the most current information, see the <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/E/C/DECA6E6B-3E81-48E7-B7EF-6D92A547D03C/print-schema-spec-2-0.zip">Print Schema Specification</a>.</p>
<p>The PrintCapabilities describe the configurations or states available on a device. A device that is described by PrintCapabilities can often be placed in a number of different configurations. In the case of a printing device, typical printing attributes include duplex printing, resolution, and media size. If the device supports these attributes, they are part of the configuration for that device. The user selects a particular configuration by assigning a specific value to each of the available attributes; for example, Duplex: OneSided, Resolution: 600 dpi, and MediaSize: Legal.</p>
<p>The PrintCapabilities are built on the Print Schema Framework, which defines the elements that can be used in the PrintCapabilities. The Print Schema Keywords define commonly-used element hierarchies, or keywords, for the purpose of promoting portability of the information and intent between individual clients. However, the Print Schema Keywords also allow private extensions so that PrintCapabilities can be tailored to meet specific needs.</p>

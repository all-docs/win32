<h1>How To: Print Using the GDI Print API</h1>
<p>This topic introduces how to print from a native Windows program using the <a href="gdi-printing.html">GDIÂ PrintÂ API</a>.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Printing is usually an integral part of a native Windows program, so it is not a feature that you can add easily after you have written the program. When designing a program for WindowsÂ 7, you should consider using the <a href="xps-printing.html">XPSÂ PrintÂ API</a> to provide the printing functionality because it provides the most compatibility for the future. Programs that must run on WindowsÂ Vista and earlier versions of Windows will most likely use the <a href="gdi-printing.html">GDIÂ PrintÂ API</a> to provide printing functionality. The GDIÂ PrintÂ API is also supported in WindowsÂ 7, but it is more limited than the XPSÂ PrintÂ API.</p>

<h1>Microsoft XPS Document Writer (MXDW)</h1>
<p>The Microsoft XPS Document Writer (MXDW) is a print-to-file driver that enables a Windows application to create XML Paper Specification (XPS) document files on versions of Windows starting with WindowsÂ XP with Service PackÂ 2 (SP2). Using the MXDW makes it possible for a Windows application to save its content as an XPS document without changing any of the application's program code.</p>
<p>If you create an XPS file, but don't have an app to save or store the contents, you can use the Microsoft XPS Document Writer printer to save all content of the XPS file. Microsoft XPS Document Writer comes pre-installed on Windows 10 and Windows 11, just press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>P</code> to print/save an XPS file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
You can repair the XPS Document Writer by removing and re-adding it via the Settings app.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch 'Settings' -&gt; 'System' -&gt; 'Optional Features'</li>
<li>Select 'More Windows features' under 'Related Settings'</li>
<li>Uncheck 'Microsoft XPS Document Writer' to remove it</li>
<li>Recheck 'Microsoft XPS Document Writer' to reinstall it</li>
</ol>

<h2>When to Use</h2>
<p>As a <strong>user</strong>, you would select the MXDW when you want to create an XPS document from a Windows application that does not have the option to save its content as an XPS document.</p>
<p>As an <strong>application developer</strong>, you would recommend the MXDW to users who want to create XPS documents when your application does not offer the option to save as an XPS document. For more information on the XML Paper Specification and XPS documents, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification">XML Paper Specification</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_XML_Paper_Specification">XPS Specification and License Downloads</a>.</p>
<p>The MXDW is installed automatically on WindowsÂ Vista and later versions of Windows and can be downloaded and installed on WindowsÂ XP with SP2 and Windows ServerÂ 2003.</p>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>When installed, the MXDW appears as an available print queue in the Print dialog box presented by an application. When the MXDW is selected as the printer, the user is prompted for the file name to create as the XPS Document that captures the print output of the application.</p>
<p>Application developers can customize the output of MXDW using the <a href="mxdw-configuration-settings.html">MXDW configuration settings</a>.</p>

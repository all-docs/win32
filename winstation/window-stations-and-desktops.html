<h1>Window Stations and Desktops</h1>
<p>Windows provides three main categories of objects: user interface, graphics device interface (GDI), and kernel. <a href="/windows/desktop/SysInfo/kernel-objects">Kernel objects</a> are securable, while <a href="/windows/desktop/SysInfo/user-objects">user objects</a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/SysInfo/gdi-objects">GDI objects</a> are not. Therefore, to provide additional security, user interface objects are managed using window stations and desktops, which themselves are securable objects.</p>

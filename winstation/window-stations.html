<h1>Window Stations</h1>
<p>A <em>window station</em> contains a clipboard, an atom table, and one or more <a href="desktops.html">desktop</a> objects. Each window station object is a securable object. When a window station is created, it is associated with the calling process and assigned to the current session.</p>
<p>The <em>interactive window station</em> is the only window station that can display a user interface or receive user input. It is assigned to the logon session of the interactive user, and contains the keyboard, mouse, and display device. It is always named &quot;WinSta0&quot;. All other window stations are noninteractive, which means they cannot display a user interface or receive user input.</p>
<p>When a user logs on to a computer using Remote Desktop Services, a session is started for the user. Each session is associated with its own interactive window station named &quot;WinSta0&quot;. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/TermServ/terminal-services-sessions">Remote Desktop Sessions</a>.</p>

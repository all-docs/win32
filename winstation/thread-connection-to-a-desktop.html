<h1>Thread Connection to a Desktop</h1>
<p>After a process connects to a window station, the system assigns a desktop to the thread making the connection. The system determines the desktop to assign to the thread according to the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the thread has called the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddesktop"><strong>SetThreadDesktop</strong></a> function, it connects to the specified desktop.</li>
<li>If the thread did not call <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddesktop"><strong>SetThreadDesktop</strong></a>, it connects to the desktop inherited from the parent process.</li>
<li>If the thread did not call <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setthreaddesktop"><strong>SetThreadDesktop</strong></a> and did not inherit a desktop, the system attempts to open for MAXIMUM_ALLOWED access and connect to a desktop as follows:
<ul>
<li>If a desktop name was specified in the <strong>lpDesktop</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/ns-processthreadsapi-startupinfoa"><strong>STARTUPINFO</strong></a> structure that was used when the process was created, the thread connects to the specified desktop.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the thread connects to the default desktop of the window station to which the process connected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The desktop assigned during this connection process cannot be closed by calling the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-closedesktop"><strong>CloseDesktop</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>When a process is connecting to a desktop, the system searches the process's handle table for inherited handles. The system uses the first desktop handle it finds. If you want a child process to connect to a particular inherited desktop, you must ensure that the only the desired handle is marked inheritable. If a child process inherits multiple desktop handles, the results of the desktop connection are undefined.</p>
<p>Handles to a desktop that the system opens while connecting a process to a desktop are not inheritable.</p>

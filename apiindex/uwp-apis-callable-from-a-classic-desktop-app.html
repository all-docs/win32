<h2>description: The general rule is that a desktop app can call a Windows Runtime (WinRT) API. However, some APIs, including the XAML UI APIs, require the calling app to have a package identity.

<h1>WinRT APIs callable from a desktop app</h1>
<p>Most <a href="/uwp/api/">Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs</a> can be used by desktop (.NET and native C++) apps. However, some WinRT classes are designed for and are only supported for use in UWP apps. This includes <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcher">CoreDispatcher</a>, <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Core.CoreWindow">CoreWindow</a>, <a href="/uwp/api/windows.ui.viewmanagement.applicationview">ApplicationView</a>, and some related classes. Other WinRT classes work in desktop apps except for specific members.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/desktop-to-uwp-supported-api">Windows Runtime APIs not supported in desktop apps</a>. Where available, this article suggests alternative APIs to achieve the same functionality as the unsupported APIs.</p>

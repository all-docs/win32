<p>An <em>umbrella library</em> is a single static-link library that exports a subset of Win32 APIs. For example, an umbrella library named <strong>OneCore.lib</strong> provides the exports for the subset of Win32 APIs that are common to all Windows devices.</p>
<p>The APIs in an umbrella library might be implemented across a range of modules (where a module is either an <a href="windows-apisets.html">API set</a> or a DLL). But the umbrella library abstracts that detail away from you, making your app more portable across operating system versions. In your desktop app or driver, simply link the umbrella library that contains the set of APIs that you're interested in, and that's all you need to do.</p>

<td>Provides the exports for the subset of Win32 APIs that are common to all WindowsÂ 10 devices, and later. Link <code>OneCore.lib</code> (and no other libraries) to access those APIs. If you link <code>OneCore.lib</code>, and you call only Win32 APIs in that library, then your desktop app or driver will load successfully on all WindowsÂ 10 devices, and later.</td>

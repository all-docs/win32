<h1>Controlling Feature Selection States</h1>
<p>You can control which feature installation options are available for users and applications to select by authoring the <a href="feature-table.html">Feature table</a> and <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent selection of the advertise state for a feature, include <strong>msidbFeatureAttributesDisallowAdvertise</strong> in the feature's Attributes field in the <a href="feature-table.html">Feature table</a>.</li>
<li>To prevent selection of the run-from-source or run-from-network states for a feature, include <strong>msidbComponentAttributesLocalOnly</strong> in the Attributes fields in the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a> for every component belonging to the feature. If a feature has no components, the feature always has the run-from-source and run-from-my-computer options available.</li>
<li>To prevent selection of the run-from-my-computer state for a feature, include <strong>msidbComponentAttributesSourceOnly</strong> in the Attributes fields in the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a> for every component belonging to the feature. If a feature has no components, the feature always has the run-from-source and run-from-my-computer options available.</li>
<li>New child features can be authored by including <strong>msidbFeatureAttributesFollowParent</strong> and <strong>msidbFeatureAttributesUIDisallowAbsent</strong> in the Attributes field of the <a href="feature-table.html">Feature table</a>.</li>

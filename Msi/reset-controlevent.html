<h1>Reset ControlEvent</h1>
<p>The dialog box is reset. In other words, all the controls on the dialog box are called to undo the property changes they have performed. This event resets all the property values to what they were when the dialog box was created.</p>
<p>This event can be published by a <a href="pushbutton-control.html">PushButton Control</a> or a <a href="selectiontree-control.html">SelectionTree control</a>. This event should be authored into the <a href="controlevent-table.html">ControlEvent table</a>.</p>
<p>This ControlEvent requires the user interface to be run at the <a href="f-gly.html"><em>full UI</em></a> level. This event will not work with a <a href="r-gly.html"><em>reduced UI</em></a> or <a href="b-gly.html"><em>basic UI</em></a>. For information, see <a href="user-interface-levels.html">User Interface Levels</a>.</p>
<p>There is a case, which should occur rarely in practice, that is not handled properly by this ControlEvent. If there are two or more controls on the same dialog box linked indirectly to the same property and at least one of them started having some other property, then this property value will sometimes be reset to its second value.</p>

<h2>Typical Use</h2>

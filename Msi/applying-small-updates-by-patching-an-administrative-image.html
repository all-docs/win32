<h1>Applying Small Updates by Patching an Administrative Image</h1>
<p>An <a href="administrative-installation.html">administrative installation</a> creates a source image of an application or product on a network. Users in a workgroup who have access to this administrative image can install the product from this source. Updating the application for this workgroup is done in two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the small update patch can be applied to the administrative image.</li>
<li>Second, the changes in the small update need to be propagated to the users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To apply a small update patch to an administrative image</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Obtain the small update in the form of a <a href="patch-packages.html">patch package</a>. For example, the small update named Patch.msp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain the path to the administrative image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the command line use:</p>
<p><strong>msiexec /a</strong> <em>[path to administrative image .msi file]</em> <strong>/p</strong> <em>patch.msp</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This updates the application files and the .msi file of the administrative image. For a list of the options that can be used with Msiexec.exe, see <a href="command-line-options.html">Command Line Options</a>. Windows Installer automatically determines whether the administrative image is using short file names and sets the <a href="shortfilenames.html"><strong>SHORTFILENAMES</strong></a> property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resulting administrative image is the same as that produced by an administrative installation using a full product CD-ROM that includes the update. When new users install the application from this source they receive the updated application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>To propagate the small update to the workgroup</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Members of the workgroup obtain the changes by reinstalling the application from the administrative image using the procedure described in <a href="applying-small-updates-by-reinstalling-the-product.html">Applying Small Updates by Reinstalling the Product</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Make a COM Component in an Existing Package Private</h1>
<p>An administrator can force a COM-client application to always use the same copy of a COM-server in an existing packageâ€”without affecting other applicationsâ€”by specifying an <a href="isolated-components.html">isolated components</a> relationship between the COM server and client. This installs a private copy of the COM-server component to a location used exclusively by the client application. The administrator needs to use transforms or a package authoring tool to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the COM server DLL and the .exe client in separate components.</li>
<li>Enter a record in the <a href="isolatedcomponent-table.html">IsolatedComponent table</a> with the COM-client component in the Component_Shared column and the client application in the Component_Application column. Include the <a href="isolatecomponents-action.html">IsolateComponents action</a> in the sequence tables.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>msidbComponentAttributesSharedDllRefCount</strong> bit in the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a> record for Component_Shared. The installer requires this global refcount on the shared location to protect the shared files and registration in cases where there is sharing with other installation technologies.</li>
</ul>

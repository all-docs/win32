<h1>Merging a Multiple Language Module into the Same Package Multiple Times</h1>
<p>When a module supports multiple languages, you can merge it into the same Windows Installer database multiple times, but make sure that each merge uses a different language. Before each merge, request a different language from the module. The resulting .msi database then has a record in the <a href="modulesignature-table.html">ModuleSignature Table</a> for each merge of the module. Components that are shared between languages exist only one time in the <a href="component-table.html">Component Table</a>, but are associated with each language in the <a href="modulecomponents-table.html">ModuleComponents Table</a>.</p>
<p>When merging multiple languages of a module into the same package, each merge must satisfy the same restrictions on code pages as single-language modules. The modules cannot contain strings in different code pages.</p>
<p>When merging a module multiple times into a single .msi file, you may need to modify the order of the files in the <a href="file-table.html">File Table</a> to use the existing .cab from the module directly in your installation. The order of files in the File Table must match the order of files in the .cab. When merging a module multiple times into an installation database the sequence may be modified, because files shared between the languages may already exist in the module from a prior merge, and they have a different relative sequence number.</p>

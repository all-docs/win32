<h1>Authoring the Launch Custom Action</h1>
<p>The source code for a sample custom action named Launch, which meets the sample specifications, is provided by the Windows Installer SDK as the file Tutorial.cpp. This custom action makes use of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msiquery/nf-msiquery-msiformatrecorda"><strong>MsiFormatRecord</strong></a> to format a string containing properties. The property [#FileKey] resolves to the full path of the HTML file. Use the source file to create the file Tutorial.dll. The entry point to this DLL is LaunchTutorial.</p>
<p>The sample custom action Launch calls a DLL written in C++ and is generated from a temporary binary stream. Custom actions of this type include the base type constants msidbCustomActionTypeDll and msidbCustomActionTypeBinaryData, which give a base numeric type equal to 1. See <a href="custom-action-type-1.html">Custom Action Type 1</a>. Because the specifications require that the installation continue if the custom action fails, Launch also includes the optional constant <strong>msidbCustomActionTypeContinue</strong>, which is 64. See <a href="custom-action-return-processing-options.html">Custom Action Return Processing Options</a>. The total numeric type of Launch is 65.</p>

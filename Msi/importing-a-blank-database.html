<h1>Importing a Blank Database</h1>
<p>To reproduce the sample you need to copy, or create with a software tool, a Windows Installer database file. A totally blank installation database, Schema.msi, is provided with the <a href="platform-sdk-components-for-windows-installer-developers.html">Windows SDK Components for Windows Installer Developers</a>. The SDK also provides a partially blank database, uisample.msi, that contains the suggested sequence tables and data required for a simple user interface. Make a copy of uisample.msi and move it into the same directory containing the Notepad folder you created in <a href="planning-the-installation.html">Planning the Installation</a>. Rename the file MNP2000.msi. The installation database file and the source files must both be located at the root of the same directory. For example:</p>
<p>C:\Sample\MNP2000.msi</p>
<p>C:\Sample\Notepad\</p>
<p>If you do not use Uisample.msi, then you must obtain a blank database, such as Schema.msi, and enter information for the installation using a database editing tool such as Orca, which is provided with the SDK, or another database editor.</p>

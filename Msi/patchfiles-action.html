<h1>PatchFiles Action</h1>
<p>The PatchFiles action queries the <a href="patch-table.html">Patch table</a> to determine which patches are to be applied. The PatchFiles action also performs the byte-wise patching of the files.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>If the file that is to be patched is not installed, the PatchFiles action must come after the <a href="installfiles-action.html">InstallFiles action</a> that installs the file. Previously installed files may be patched at any point in the action sequence. The <a href="duplicatefiles-action.html">DuplicateFiles Action</a> must come after the PatchFiles action to prevent duplicating the unpatched version of the file.</p>

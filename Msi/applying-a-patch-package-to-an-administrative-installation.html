<h1>Applying a Patch Package to an Administrative Installation</h1>
<p>You may apply the small update to an administrative source image of MNP2000.msi by installing the sample patch MNP2000.msp created in <a href="generating-a-patch-package.html">Generating a Patch Package</a>. The update can then be propagated to users by requesting that they reinstall the application from the new administrative source image.</p>
<p>An administrator can use the following command line to update the administrative source image located at //server/MNP2000.msi to a new source image that is the same as would be produced by an administrative installation from a fully updated CD-ROM.</p>
<p><strong>msiexec /a //server/MNP2000.msi /p MNP2000.msp</strong></p>
<p>Members of the workgroup using MNP2000 then must reinstall the application from the new administrative source image to receive the update.</p>
<p>To completely reinstall the applications and cache the updated .msi file on the user's computer, users may enter either of the following commands.</p>
<p><strong>msiexec /fvomus //server/MNP2000.msi</strong></p>
<p><strong>msiexec /I //server/MNP2000.msi REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus</strong></p>
<p>To reinstall only the updated Concert feature and cache the updated .msi file on the user's computer, users may enter the following command.</p>
<p><strong>msiexec /I //server/MNP2000.msi REINSTALL=Concert REINSTALLMODE=vomus</strong></p>

<h1>Installation Mechanism</h1>
<p>There are two phases to a successful installation process: acquisition and execution. If the installation is unsuccessful, a rollback phase may occur.</p>
<h2>Acquisition</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the acquisition phase, an application or a user instructs the installer to install a feature or an application. The installer then progresses through the actions specified in the sequence tables of the installation database. These actions query the installation database and generate a script that gives a step-by-step procedure for performing the installation.</p>
<h2>Execution</h2>
<p>During the execution phase, the installer passes the information to a process with elevated privileges and runs the script.</p>
<h2>Rollback</h2>
<p>If an installation is unsuccessful, the installer restores the original state of the computer. When the installer processes the installation script it simultaneously generates a rollback script. In addition to the rollback script, the installer saves a copy of every file it deletes during the installation. These files are kept in a hidden, system directory. Once the installation is complete, the rollback script and the saved files are deleted. For more information, see <a href="rollback-installation.html">Rollback Installation</a>.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AllowLaxValidationFlags</td>
<td>If this property is set to 1, an entry is written in the log and no error is returned if the ProductValidateFlags field in the <a href="targetimages-table-patchwiz-dll-.html">TargetImages table</a> cannot be validated. This property should only be set when the patch author has changed the value in the ProductValidateFlags field. The default value for this property is 0. Available beginning with Patchwiz.dll version 4.0.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AllowProductCodeMismatches</td>
<td>Set to '1' for True if the <a href="productcode.html"><strong>ProductCode</strong></a> Property may differ between the upgraded images listed in the <a href="upgradedimages-table-patchwiz-dll-.html">UpgradedImages Table</a> and the target images listed in the <a href="targetimages-table-patchwiz-dll-.html">TargetImages Table</a>. Set to '0' or blank to mean False if the product codes must be the same.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AllowProductVersionMajorMismatches</td>
<td>Set to '1' to mean True if the first field (the major version field) of the <a href="productversion.html"><strong>ProductVersion</strong></a> Property may differ between upgraded images and target images. Set to '0' or blank to mean False if the major versions must match.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ApiPatchingSymbolFlags</td>
<td>An 8-digit hex integer representing the combination of patch symbol usage flags to use when creating a binary file patch. Default is 0x00000000. See Patchapi.h for the complete list of possible PATCH_SYMBOL_* flags. See the glossary for more information on symbol files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DontRemoveTempFolderWhenFinished</td>
<td>Set to '1' to mean True if the temporary folder containing the transforms, the byte-level patches, and the entire new files are not being removed after creating the patch package. This is essentially the contents of the .msp file before being embedded into the patch package. This may be useful for debugging patches. Set to '0' or blank to mean False if the temporary folder is to be removed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IncludeWholeFilesOnly</td>
<td>Set to '1' to mean True if files being changed are to be included in their entirety when creating the patch package instead of creating a binary file patch. The patch files will be bigger in size but the API runs faster. Set to '0' or blank to mean False if creating a binary file patch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ListOfPatchGUIDsToReplace</td>
<td>A list of PatchGUID identifiers with no delimiter. If any of these patches are found to be installed on the user's computer and registered with Windows Installer, they are unregistered from the appropriate product and their patch transforms are removed from the list of transforms associated with the product. Note that the removal of a patch does not affect any of the files, only the registration of the patch. Optional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ListOfTargetProductCodes</td>
<td>A list of <a href="product-codes.html">Product Codes</a> for products that may receive this patch. This is a semicolon delimited list of <a href="productcode.html">ProductCode</a> Property values. If the list begins with an asterisk, the list of product codes is generated from the .msi files of the targets listed in the <a href="targetimages-table-patchwiz-dll-.html">TargetImages Table</a>. If any product codes follow a leading asterisk, they are appended to the list that replaces the asterisk. If the property is not set, a list of product codes is generated from the .msi files of the targets listed in the <a href="targetimages-table-patchwiz-dll-.html">TargetImages Table</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MsiFileToUseToCreatePatchTables</td>
<td>The full path to a template .msi file from which to export the <a href="patch-table.html">Patch Table</a> and <a href="patchpackage-table.html">PatchPackage Table</a>. Optional.The Properties Table accepts environment variables for paths beginning with version 4.0 of Patchwiz.dll. Use the Windows format for the environment variable, such as %<em>ENV_VAR</em>%. Do not use the <a href="formatted.html">Formatted</a> column data type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OptimizePatchSizeForLargeFiles</td>
<td>This property is set when the value exists and is not &quot;0&quot;. When this property is set, patches for files greater than approximately 4 MB in size may be made smaller.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PatchGUID</td>
<td>A <a href="guid.html">GUID</a> identifier for this patch package (.msp file). Every patch package must have a unique PatchGUID value. Required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PatchOutputPath</td>
<td>The full path, including file name, of the patch package file that is to be generated. If <em>szPatchPath</em> is passed by the <a href="uicreatepatchpackageex--patchwiz-dll-.html">UiCreatePatchPackageEx</a> function, the passed value is used. This property is required if <em>szPatchPath</em> is null or an empty string.The Properties Table accepts environment variables for paths beginning with version 4.0 of Patchwiz.dll. Use the Windows format for the environment variable, such as %<em>ENV_VAR</em>%. Do not use the <a href="formatted.html">Formatted</a> column data type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PatchSourceList</td>
<td>A source used to locate the .msp file for the patch in the event that the locally cached copy is unavailable. This value is added to the source list of the patch when it is applied to a product. Optional.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MinimumRequiredMsiVersion</td>
<td>Set this property to force Patchwiz.dll to generate a patch that requires a particular version of Windows Installer. This property value helps determine what value to use for the <a href="word-count-summary.html"><strong>Word Count Summary</strong></a> Property of the patch package. The value for this property is of the same form as the <a href="page-count-summary.html"><strong>Page Count Summary</strong></a> Property of the installation package. If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 200, Patchwiz.dll sets the <a href="word-count-summary.html"><strong>Word Count Summary</strong></a> property of the patch package to 3. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer version earlier than version 2.0.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 300, Patchwiz.dll sets the <a href="word-count-summary.html"><strong>Word Count Summary</strong></a> Property of the patch package to 4. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer versions earlier than version 3.0.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 310, Patchwiz.dll sets the <a href="word-count-summary.html"><strong>Word Count Summary</strong></a> Property of the patch package to 5. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer earlier than version 3.1.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> If a .pcp file has a MinimumRequiredMsiVersion equal to 400, Patchwiz.dll sets the <a href="word-count-summary.html"><strong>Word Count Summary</strong></a> property of the patch package to 6. This prevents the patch from being applied by Windows Installer earlier than version 4.0.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PATCH_CACHE_ENABLED</td>
<td>Set this property to 1 to cache the patch creation information in the folder specified by the PATCH_CACHE_DIR property. Patch caching increases the speed of patch creation when recreating a new patch after updating the update image. This property requires Patchwiz.dll in Windows InstallerÂ  2.0 or later. For information, see <a href="patch-information-caching-patchwiz-dll-.html">Patch Information Caching (Patchwiz.dll)</a>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>PATCH_CACHE_DIR</td>
<td>Set this property to the name of the folder that stores the cached patch information. Patchwiz.dll creates this folder if necessary. The folder should be on a drive with sufficient disk space. This property is only used if the PATCH_CACHE_ENABLED property is set to 1. The Properties Table accepts environment variables for paths beginning with version 4.0 of Patchwiz.dll. Use the Windows format for the environment variable, such as %<em>ENV_VAR</em>%. Do not use the <a href="formatted.html">Formatted</a> column data type. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SEQUENCE_DATA_GENERATION_DISABLED</td>
<td>Set this property to 1 (one) to prevent the automatic generation of patch sequencing information. If this property is absent, sequencing information is automatically generated and added.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SEQUENCE_DATA_SUPERSEDENCE</td>
<td>Set this property to 0 (zero) or 1 (one) to write that value in the Attributes field of all rows in the <a href="msipatchsequence-table.html">MsiPatchSequence table</a>.</td>

<tr>
<td>TrustMsi</td>
<td>Set this property to 1 in the Properties Table to use the file version information, size, and hash values provided in the .msi file. If this property is set but the information in the .msi file is incorrect, the patch created may not function correctly. You should update the target and upgraded .msi files using <a href="msifiler-exe.html">MsiFiler.exe</a>. The default value for this property is 0.

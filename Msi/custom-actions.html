<h1>Custom Actions</h1>
<p>The Windows Installer provides many built-in actions for performing the installation process. For a list of these actions, see the <a href="standard-actions-reference.html">Standard Actions Reference</a>.</p>
<p>Standard actions are sufficient to execute an installation in most cases. However, there are situations where the developer of an installation package finds it necessary to write a custom action. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to launch an executable during installation that is installed on the user's machine or that is being installed with the application.</li>
<li>You want to call special functions during an installation that are defined in a dynamic-link library (DLL).</li>
<li>You want to use functions written in the development languages Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition or Microsoft JScript literal script text during an installation.</li>
<li>You want to defer the execution of some actions until the time when the installation script is being executed.</li>
<li>You want to add time and progress information to a ProgressBar control and a TimeRemaining Text control.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe custom actions and how to incorporate them into an installation package:</p>

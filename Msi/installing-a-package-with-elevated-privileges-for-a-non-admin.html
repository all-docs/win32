<h1>Installing a Package with Elevated Privileges for a Non-Admin</h1>
<p>An administrator can use the following methods to enable a non-administrator user to install an application with elevated system privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Windows Vista and later versions, with Windows Installer, a member of the Administrators group can provide authorization for a non-administrator to elevate the installation through <a href="u-gly.html"><em>User Account Control</em></a> (UAC) as described in <a href="using-windows-installer-with-uac.html">Using Windows Installer with UAC</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ Vista and newer versions:</strong> Required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following methods can also be used to install an application with elevated system privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An administrator can advertise an application on a user's computer by assigning or publishing the Windows Installer package using application deployment and <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/Policy/group-policy-start-page">Group Policy</a>. The administrator advertises the package for per-machine installation. If a non-administrator user then installs the application, the installation can run with elevated privileges. Non-administrator users cannot install unadvertised packages that require elevated system privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An administrator can go to the user's computer and <a href="advertisement.html">advertise</a> the application for per-machine installation. Because the Windows Installer always has elevated privileges while doing installs in the per-machine <a href="installation-context.html">installation context</a>, if a non-administrator user then installs the advertised application, the installation can run with elevated privileges. Non-administrator users still cannot install unadvertised packages that require elevated privileges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A non-privileged user can install an advertised application that requires elevated privileges if a local system agent advertises the application. The application can be advertised for a per-user or per-machine installation. An application installed using this method is considered managed. For more information, see <a href="advertising-a-per-user-application-to-be-installed-with-elevated-privileges.html">Advertising a Per-User Application To Be Installed with Elevated Privileges</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An administrator can set the <a href="alwaysinstallelevated.html">AlwaysInstallElevated</a> policy for both per-user and per-machine installations. This method can open a computer to a security risk, because when this policy is set, a non-administrator user can run installations with elevated privileges and access secure locations on the computer, such as the SystemFolder or the <strong>HKLM</strong> registry key.</p>
<p>If the application is installed per-machine while the <a href="alwaysinstallelevated.html">AlwaysInstallElevated</a> policy is set, the product is treated as managed. In this case, the application can still perform a repair with elevated privileges if the policy is removed. Also, if the application is installed per-user while the AlwaysInstallElevated policy is set, the application is unable to perform a repair if the policy is removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An administrator can go to a user's computer and do a per-machine installation of the application. Because privileges are required to perform this type of installation, per-machine installations are always managed.</p>
</li>
</ul>

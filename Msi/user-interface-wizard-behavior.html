<h1>User Interface Wizard Behavior</h1>
<p>To author a simple user interface, developers of installation packages can utilize a user interface design that adheres to interface wizard behavior.</p>
<p>The term user interface wizard behavior means that each dialog box in a sequence contains a <strong>Next&gt;&gt;</strong> button, which the user clicks to move to the next dialog box after entering data or configuring information in the current dialog box. If the user decides to go back and change any information entered in a previous dialog box, each dialog box contains a <strong>&lt;&lt;Previous</strong> button that the user clicks to go back. At the end of the wizard sequence, the user clicks a <strong>Finish</strong> button to begin the installation process.</p>
<p>The UI described in the UI example adheres to user interface wizard behavior. See <a href="an-installation-example.html">An Installation Example</a>.</p>

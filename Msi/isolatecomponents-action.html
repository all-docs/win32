<h1>IsolateComponents Action</h1>
<p>The IsolateComponents action installs a copy of a component (commonly a shared DLL) into a private location for use by a specific application (typically an .exe). This isolates the application from other copies of the component that may be installed to a shared location on the computer. For more information, see <a href="isolated-components.html">Isolated Components</a>.</p>
<p>The action refers to each record of the <a href="isolatedcomponent-table.html">IsolatedComponent table</a> and associates the files of the component listed in the Component_Shared field with the component listed in the Component_Application field. The installer installs the files of Component_Shared into the same directory as Component_Application. The installer generates a file in this directory, zero bytes in length, having the short filename name of the key file for Component_Application (typically this is the same file name as the .exe) appended with .local. The IsolatedComponent action does not affect the installation of Component_Application. Uninstalling Component_Application also removes the Component_Shared files and the .local file from the directory.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>The IsolateComponents action can be used only in the <a href="installuisequence-table.html">InstallUISequence table</a> and the <a href="installexecutesequence-table.html">InstallExecuteSequence table</a>. This action must come after the <a href="costinitialize-action.html">CostInitialize action</a> and before the <a href="costfinalize-action.html">CostFinalize action</a>.</p>
<h2>ActionData Messages</h2>
<p>There are no ActionData messages.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>If the Condition column for the IsolateComponents action evaluates to True, or is left blank, the installer isolates all the components listed in the <a href="isolatedcomponent-table.html">IsolatedComponent table</a>. If the Condition column evaluates to False, the installer ignores the IsolatedComponent table and shares the components usual. The <a href="redirecteddllsupport.html"><strong>RedirectedDllSupport</strong></a> property may be used to condition this action. For more information, see <a href="using-a-sequence-table.html">Using a Sequence Table</a>.</p>

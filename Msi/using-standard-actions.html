<h1>Using Standard Actions</h1>
<p>An action is executed in the Windows Installer either by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msiquery/nf-msiquery-msidoactiona"><strong>MsiDoAction</strong></a> function or including the action in a sequence table. Because most actions encapsulate a single purpose, the most common way to use actions is to order a series of actions into a sequence to accomplish a larger task. The installer has three standard top-level actions that call an associated set of sequence tables. These associated sequence tables may contain standard actions, custom actions, and user-interface elements. Each action in a sequence table has an associated sequence number and may also have an associated conditional expression. All actions in a sequence table are visited in order and are only executed if the conditional expression evaluates to True.</p>
<p>While a standard action can have any sequence number associated with it, many have sequence restrictions which must be followed for the action to function properly. For example the <a href="filecost-action.html">FileCost action</a>, must be called after the <a href="costinitialize-action.html">CostInitialize action</a>. For more information on standard action sequencing restrictions, see <a href="actions-with-sequencing-restrictions.html">Actions with Sequencing Restrictions</a>, <a href="actions-without-sequencing-restrictions.html">Actions without Sequencing Restrictions</a>, or <a href="standard-actions-reference.html">Standard Actions Reference</a>.</p>

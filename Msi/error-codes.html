<h1>MsiExec.exe and InstMsi.exe error messages (for developers)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]<br />
This article is intended for software developers who use Windows Installer to build installer packages for their applications. If you're a user experiencing difficulty with your computer either during or after installing or uninstalling an application, you should contact customer support for the software you're trying to install or remove. If you need support for a Microsoft product, please go to our <a href="https://support.microsoft.com">technical support site</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These error codes are returned by the Windows Installer functions <em>MsiExec.exe</em> and <em>InstMsi.exe</em>. Note that any error in <em>Winerror.h</em> (such as ERROR_INVALID_DATA) can be returned as well. For more error codes returned by the Windows Installer, see <a href="windows-installer-error-messages.html">Windows Installer error messages</a>.</p>
<p>The error codes ERROR_SUCCESS, ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_INITIATED, and ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_REQUIRED indicate success. If ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_REQUIRED is returned, the installation completed successfully but a reboot is required to complete the installation operation.</p>

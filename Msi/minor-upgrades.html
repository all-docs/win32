<h1>Minor Upgrades</h1>
<p>A minor upgrade is an update that makes changes to many resources. None of the changes can require changing the <a href="productcode.html"><strong>ProductCode</strong></a>. An update requires a <a href="major-upgrades.html">major upgrade</a> to change the <strong>ProductCode</strong>. A minor upgrade can be used to add new features and components but cannot reorganize the feature-component tree. Minor upgrades provide product differentiation without actually defining a different product. A typical minor upgrade includes all fixes in previous small updates combined into a patch. A minor upgrade is also commonly referred to as a service pack (SP) update. For more information about which updates do not require changing the <strong>ProductCode</strong> see <a href="changing-the-product-code.html">Changing the Product Code</a>.</p>
<p>A minor upgrade changes the <a href="productversion.html"><strong>ProductVersion</strong></a> property. Changing the product version of the application means that the different updates have an order. For example, if a patch existed to update vÂ 9.0 to vÂ 9.1, and another patch existed to patch vÂ 9.1 to vÂ 9.2, the installer can enforce the correct order by checking the product version before applying the patch. This also prevents the vÂ 9.1 to vÂ 9.2 patch from being applied to vÂ 9.0. For patches, this ordering is enforced through the product versionâ€“validation bits set in the transforms included in the <a href="patch-packages.html">patch package</a>.</p>
<p>A minor upgrade and a small update differ in that a minor upgrade changes the package code and product version. See <a href="small-updates.html">Small Updates</a> for guidelines on the kinds of updates that can be handled by a small update or minor upgrade. Minor upgrades are shipped as a full product installation package or as a <a href="patch-packages.html">patch package</a>. However, a minor upgrade cannot use a different volume label for the new version.</p>

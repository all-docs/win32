<h1>Windows Installer</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
This documentation is intended for software developers who want to use Windows Installer to build installer packages for applications.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a Redistributable for Windows Installer 4.5 and earlier, see <a href="windows-installer-redistributables.html">Windows Installer Redistributables</a>. There's no Redistributable for Windows Installer 5.0. This version is included with the operating system in Windows 7, Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2, and later client and server releases, including Windows 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft Windows Installer is an installation and configuration service provided with Windows. The installer service enables customers to provide better corporate deployment and provides a standard format for component management. The installer also enables the advertisement of applications and features according to the operating system. For more information, see <a href="platform-support-of-advertisement.html">Platform support of advertisement</a>.</p>
<p>This documentation describes Windows InstallerÂ 5.0 and earlier versions. Not all the capabilities available in later Windows Installer versions are available in earlier versions. This documentation doesn't describe versions earlier than Windows InstallerÂ 2.0. Installation packages and patches that are created for Windows InstallerÂ 2.0 can still be installed by using Windows InstallerÂ 3.0 and later.</p>
<p>Windows InstallerÂ 3.0 and later can install multiple patches with a single transaction that integrates installation progress, rollback, and reboots. The installer can apply patches in a specified order regardless of the order that the patches are provided to the system. Patching using Windows InstallerÂ 3.0 only updates files affected by the patch and can be significantly faster than earlier installer versions. Patches installed with Windows Installer 3.0 or later can be uninstalled in any order to leave the state of the product the same as if the patch was never installed.</p>
<p>Accounts with administrator privileges can use the API of Windows InstallerÂ 3.0 and later to query and inventory product, feature, component, and patch information. The installer can be used to read, edit, and replace source lists for network, URL, and media sources. Administrators can enumerate across user and install contexts, and manage source lists from an external process.</p>
<p>Windows Installer 4.5 and later can install multiple installation packages using <a href="t-gly.html"><em>transaction processing</em></a>. If all the packages in the transaction can't be installed successfully, or if the user cancels the installation, the Windows Installer can roll back changes and restore the computer to its original state. The installer ensures that all the packages belonging to a multiple-package transaction are installed or none of the packages are installed.</p>
<p>Beginning with Windows Installer 5.0, a package can be authored to secure new accounts, Windows <a href="../services/services.html">Services</a>, files, folders, and registry keys. The package can specify a security descriptor that denies permissions, specifies inheritance of permissions from a parent resource, or specifies the permissions of a new account. For more information, see <a href="securing-resources-.html">Securing resources</a>.</p>
<p>The Windows Installer 5.0 service can enumerate all components installed on the computer and obtain the key path for the component. For more information, see <a href="enumerating-components-.html">Enumerating components</a>.</p>
<p>By <a href="using-services-configuration.html">Using services configuration</a>, Windows Installer 5.0 packages can customize the services on a computer. Setup developers can use Windows Installer 5.0 and <a href="single-package-authoring.html">Single package authoring</a> to develop single installation packages capable of installing an application in either the per-machine or per-user <a href="installation-context.html">installation context</a>.</p>
<h2>Where to use Windows Installer</h2>
<p>Windows Installer enables the efficient installation and configuration of your products and applications running on Windows. The installer provides new capabilities to advertise features without installing them, to install products on demand, and to add user customizations.</p>
<p>Windows Installer 5.0, running on Windows ServerÂ 2012 or WindowsÂ 8, supports the installation of approved apps on WindowsÂ RT. A Windows Installer package, patch, or transform that hasn't been signed by Microsoft can't be installed on WindowsÂ RT. The <a href="template-summary.html">Template Summary property</a> indicates the platform that is compatible with an installation database and in this case should include the value for WindowsÂ RT.</p>
<p>Windows Installer is intended for the development of desktop style applications.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>This documentation is intended for software developers who want to make applications that use Windows Installer. It provides general background information about installation packages and the installer service. It contains complete descriptions of the application programming interface and elements of the installer database. This documentation also contains supplemental information for developers who want to use a table editor or a package creation tool to make or maintain an installation.</p>

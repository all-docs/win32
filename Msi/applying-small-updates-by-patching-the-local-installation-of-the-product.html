<h1>Applying Small Updates by Patching the Local Installation of the Product</h1>
<p>A small update can be applied to an application by patching the local installation of the application.</p>
<p><strong>To apply a small update patch to a local installation of the product</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the installation of the patch from the command line or by using an executable. To launch from the command line, use <strong>msiexec /p patch.msp REINSTALL=[<em><strong>Feature list</strong></em>] REINSTALLMODE=omus</strong>. To launch from an executable, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msiapplypatcha"><strong>MsiApplyPatch</strong></a> or the <a href="installer-applypatch.html"><strong>ApplyPatch Method</strong></a> and provide the same command line arguments.</li>
<li>When patching a client installation, the installer ignores the installation source and proceeds to patch the files that are already installed on the user's computer.</li>
<li>The installer changes any patched components marked as run-from-source to run-locally. Users are unable to run these components from the source as long as the patch remains on the computer.</li>
<li>The installer adds any transforms used to update the .msi file or adds patch-specific information to the user's profile.</li>
<li>The installer caches the .msi file on the user's computer so that it can perform installation-on-demand, reinstall, and repair of the application. After a patch is applied to a standalone installation, the installer references two or more source lists to external files: one for the original source and one for each patch that has been applied.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Resiliency</h1>
<p>Resiliency is the ability of an application to recover gracefully from situations in which a vital component is missing, or has been replaced by an incompatible version. By authoring an installation package and using the <a href="installer-functions.html">Installer Functions</a>, developers can use the Windows Installer to produce resilient applications capable of recovering from such situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the installer's source list to increase the resiliency of applications that rely on network resources. For more information, see <a href="source-resiliency.html">Source Resiliency</a>.</li>
<li>Use the installer's API to check whether a vital feature, component, file, or file version is installed.</li>
<li>Use the installer's API to check the path to a component at run time. This reduces your application's dependency on static file paths, which commonly differ between computers.</li>
<li>Use the installer to reinstall damaged shortcuts, registry entries, and other components without having to rerun setup.</li>
<li>Increase the resiliency of your product's installation by leaving the rollback capability of the installer enabled. For more information, see <a href="rollback-installation.html">Rollback Installation</a>.</li>
</ul>

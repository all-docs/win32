<h1>MaskedEdit Control</h1>
<p>The MaskedEdit Control is an edit field control that contains a mask in the text field of the control. You can associate the control with a string value property by entering the property name into the Property column of the <a href="control-table.html">Control Table</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the MaskedEdit Control to create a template for user entry of information such as a telephone number or Product ID code. For example, the <a href="pidkey.html"><strong>PIDKEY</strong></a> Property can be entered by the user through a MaskedEdit Control that is specified by setting the <a href="pidtemplate.html"><strong>PIDTemplate</strong></a> Property to a string like the following:</p>
<p>12345<!-- raw HTML omitted -->@@@@@</p>
<p>The string defines the masking template for the entry of the <a href="pidkey.html"><strong>PIDKEY</strong></a> Property by the user. The visible segment of the string is enclosed by a pair of bracket (&lt;&gt;) characters.</p>
<p>The following table identified the syntax of the mask.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Character</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>The left end of the visible segment of the template. This character and everything to its left are hidden in the user interface. There should be no more than one instance of this character in the template.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>The right end of the visible segment of the template. This character and everything to its right are hidden in the user interface. This character is replaced by a dash during validation. If there is a visible segment begins with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>#</td>
<td>This character can be a digit (numeral.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>%</td>
<td>This character can be an alternate digit (numeral) that enables the mask to control the way a custom action differentiates fields.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>@</td>
<td>This character can be a random digit (numeral.) This character should not appear in the visible part of the template.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&amp;</td>
<td>This character can be any character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>^</td>
<td>This character can be an alternate character that enables the mask to control the way a custom action differentiates fields.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>?</td>
<td>This character can be an alternate character that enables the mask to control the way a custom action differentiates fields.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`</td>
<td>Grave accent marks ` (ASCII value 96) can represent an alternate character that enables the mask to control the way a custom action differentiates fields.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_</td>
<td>This character is a literal underscore character.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>=</td>
<td>This character is the field terminator. This must follow a #, %, ^, or `. This creates one more input position of the same type as the preceding positions and terminates the field with a '-' separator.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Any other character is treated as a literal constant.</p>
<p>For characters that can be edited, the control creates separate edit windows with one window for each block of contiguous characters of the same kind.</p>
<h2>Control Attributes</h2>
<p>To change the value of an attribute that is using an event, subscribe the control to a Control event in the <a href="eventmapping-table.html">EventMapping Table</a> and list the attribute identifier in the Attribute column. Enter the identifier of the Control event in the Event column. You can use the following attributes with the MaskedEdit Control.</p>
<table>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The MaskedEdit Control creates one parent window of the <strong>BUTTON</strong> class with the <strong>BS_OWNERDRAW</strong> and <strong>WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT</strong> styles. It creates several child windows to this window.</p>
<ul>
<li>For constant text parts, it creates STATIC windows with the <strong>SS_LEFT</strong> and <strong>WS_CHILD</strong> styles.</li>
<li>For editable fields, it creates an EDIT window with the <strong>WS_CHILD</strong>, <strong>WS_BORDER</strong>, and <strong>WS_TABSTOP</strong> styles.</li>
<li>For numeric fields, the window also has the <strong>ES_NUMBER</strong> style.</li>
</ul>
<p>The alternate digit, %, and alternate alphanumeric characters, ^, ?, and ` fields allow custom actions to differentiate between fields in a way that can be controlled by the mask, for example, ^ can be used for fields that should be uppercase.</p>

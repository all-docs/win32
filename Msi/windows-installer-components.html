<h1>Windows Installer Components</h1>
<p>A component is a piece of the application or product to be installed. Examples of components include single files, a group of related files, COM objects, registration, registry keys, shortcuts, resources, libraries grouped into a directory, or shared pieces of code such as MFC or DAO.</p>
<p>The installer service installs or removes a component as a single coherent piece. It tracks every component by the respective component ID GUID specified in the ComponentId column of the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Two components that share the same component ID are treated as multiple instances of the same component regardless of their actual content. Only a single instance of any component is installed on a user's computer. Several features or applications may therefore share some components.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Because components are commonly shared, the author of an installation package must follow strict rules when specifying the components of a feature or application. This is essential for the correct operation of the Windows Installer reference-counting mechanism. For more information, see <a href="organizing-applications-into-components.html">Organizing Applications into Components</a>.</p>
<p>In brief, these rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each component must be stored in a single folder.</li>
<li>No file, registry entry, shortcut, or other resources should ever be shipped as a member of more than one component. This applies across products, product versions, and companies.</li>
</ul>

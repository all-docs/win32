<h1>ICE27</h1>
<p>ICE27 validates the <a href="s-gly.html"><em>sequence tables</em></a> of an installation package for valid actions, action sequence restrictions, and organization in Search, Costing, Selection, and Execution sections.</p>
<p>The ICE27 custom action validates the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the actions listed in the Action column of the sequence tables are a <a href="standard-actions.html">standard actions</a>, a custom action listed in the <a href="customaction-table.html">CustomAction table</a>, or a dialog box listed in the <a href="dialog-table.html">Dialog table</a>.</li>
<li>That actions subject to sequencing restrictions are in the correct relative order to each other in the action sequence. Sequencing restrictions result when one action is dependent on another.</li>
<li>That actions restricted to a particular section of the sequence are located where they belong. ICE27 validates the following organization of the sequence tables. Note that not every sequence table has every section. See the suggested sequence tables in <a href="using-a-sequence-table.html">Using a Sequence Table</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>ICE09</h1>
<p>ICE09 validates that the permanent bit is set for every component marked for installation into the SystemFolder. ICE09 posts a warning because you should avoid installing non-permanent system components to the SystemFolder. To prevent this warning, set the Permanent bit in the Attributes column of the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a> for every component that is marked for installation into the SystemFolder. No validation is done if the database does not have a Component table.</p>

<h1>Applying Major Upgrades by Installing the Product</h1>
<p>A major upgrade can be applied by installing the new installation package for the upgraded product. Because major upgrades get a different product code than the original product, installing the upgrade must be treated as an installation of a new product. The upgrade can simply be installed like another product. You can have the new installation package handle the removal of the old product by including the <a href="upgrade-table.html">Upgrade table</a> and the <a href="findrelatedproducts-action.html">FindRelatedProducts action</a> and <a href="removeexistingproducts-action.html">RemoveExistingProducts action</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To propagate a major upgrade to current users from the command line</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the command line, use: <strong>msiexec /i [<em><strong>path to updated msi file</strong></em>]</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To propagate a major upgrade to current users from a program</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From a program, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msiinstallproducta"><strong>MsiInstallProduct</strong></a> and specify the path to the updated msi file.</li>
</ul>

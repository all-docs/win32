<h1>Side-by-Side Assemblies</h1>
<p>Side-by-Side assembly sharing is an infrastructure that is used to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safely share assemblies among multiple applications</li>
<li>Offset some negative effects of sharing, for example, DLL conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of having a single version of an assembly that assumes backward compatibility with all applications, side-by-side assembly sharing enables multiple versions of a COM or Win32 assembly to run simultaneously on a system. For more information, see <a href="../sbscs/isolated-applications-and-side-by-side-assemblies-portal.html">Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies</a>.</p>
<p>Side-by-Side Assemblies can be installed as <a href="shared-assemblies.html">Shared Assemblies</a> or as <a href="private-assemblies.html">Private Assemblies</a>.</p>
<p>Side-by-Side Assemblies are not available on systems earlier than WindowsÂ XP.</p>

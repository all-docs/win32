<h1>Using 64-bit Custom Actions</h1>
<p>On 64-bit operating systems, Windows Installer can call custom actions that are compiled for 32-bit or 64-bit systems. A 64-bit custom action based on <a href="scripts.html">Scripts</a> must be explicitly marked as a 64-bit custom action by adding the <strong>msidbCustomActionType64BitScript</strong> bit to the custom action numeric type in the Type column of the <a href="customaction-table.html">CustomAction Table</a>. Custom actions based on <a href="executable-files.html">Executable files</a> or <a href="dynamic-link-libraries.html">Dynamic-Link Libraries</a> that are complied for 64-bit operating systems do not require including this additional bit in the Type column of the CustomAction Table.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="64-bit-custom-actions.html">64-Bit Custom Actions</a>.</p>

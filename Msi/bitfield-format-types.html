<h1>Bitfield Format Types</h1>
<p>The Bitfield Format Types of configurable data may be used in integer database fields. The user should choose a value from a specified subset. This is by convention only and is not enforced by Mergemod.dll. The msmConfigItemNonNullable attribute is implicit in this data format and does not need to be set. Null is never a valid value for this type.</p>
<p>The following Bitfield Format type exists.</p>
<p><a href="arbitrary-bitfield-type.html">Arbitrary Bitfield Type</a></p>
<p>Configurable items of the Bitfield Format Type are used in integer columns and in general could be replaced by any integer. The user should choose a value from a specified subset. This is by convention only, however, and is not enforced by Mergemod.dll. The author should prepare the module to handle any value.</p>

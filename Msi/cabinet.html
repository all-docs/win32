<h1>Cabinet</h1>
<p>The Cabinet data type must be used in the Cabinet column of the <a href="media-table.html">Media table</a>.</p>
<p>If the cabinet name is preceded by the number sign, the cabinet is stored as a data stream inside the package. The character string which follows the # is an <a href="identifier.html">Identifier</a> for this data stream. Note that if the cabinet is stored as a data stream, the name of a cabinet is case-sensitive.</p>
<p>If the cabinet name is not preceded by the number sign #, the cabinet is stored in a separate file located at the root of the source tree specified by the <a href="directory-table.html">Directory Table</a>. The cabinet file must use the short file name syntax consisting of an eight character name, a period, and a three character extension. The Cabinet data type cannot use the short|longname syntax for file names. If the cabinet file is stored as a separate file, the name of the cabinet file is not case-sensitive.</p>
<p>To conserve disk space, the installer removes any cabinets embedded in the .msi file before caching the installation package on the user's computer.</p>

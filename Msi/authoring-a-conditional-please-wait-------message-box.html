<h1>Authoring a Conditional &quot;Please Wait...&quot; Message Box</h1>
<p>The following example illustrates how to author a conditional message box that pops up and warns the user that a background task is still running whenever the user activates a displayed control prematurely.</p>
<p>The example also illustrates how the <a href="spawnwaitdialog-controlevent.html">SpawnWaitDialog ControlEvent</a> can generally be used to protect a control that triggers an action dependent upon the completion of a background task.</p>
<p>In this example, a <a href="selection-dialog.html">Selection Dialog</a> containing three push button controls labeled <strong>Install Now</strong>, <strong>Next</strong>, and <strong>Disk Cost</strong> is displayed to the user during the installation process. However, the installer also carries out a disk space costing task in the background while displaying this dialog box. The author wishes to protect these buttons from activation and wants a &quot;Please wait&quot; message box to pop up if the user clicks any of the buttons before the costing has completed. The author also wants this message box to contain a <strong>Cancel</strong> button and to disappear as soon as the background task is finished.</p>
<p><strong>To display a dialog box asking the user to wait while background disk costing is completed</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the authoring capabilities of the installer to add a new modal dialog box, named <strong>WaitForCosting</strong>, into the <a href="dialog-table.html">Dialog table</a>. The dialog box should display a text string that says &quot;Please wait while disk space costing is completed.&quot;</li>
<li>Add a single push button control to this dialog box, labeled <strong>Cancel</strong>, by authoring it into the <a href="control-table.html">Control table</a>.</li>
<li>Link the <strong>Cancel</strong> push button to a ControlEvent that closes the <strong>WaitForCosting</strong> dialog box by authoring an <a href="enddialog-controlevent.html">EndDialog ControlEvent</a> into the <a href="controlevent-table.html">ControlEvent table</a>. Set the argument of the EndDialog Control event to be Exit.</li>
<li>Link a <a href="spawnwaitdialog-controlevent.html">SpawnWaitDialog ControlEvent</a> to the existing <strong>Install Now</strong>, <strong>Next</strong>, and <strong>Disk Cost</strong> push button controls displayed in the <a href="selection-dialog.html">Selection Dialog</a> box. Set the argument of this ControlEvent in the ControlEvent table to be the <strong>WaitForCosting</strong> dialog box and set the expression in the Condition column of the table to be: <a href="costingcomplete.html"><strong>CostingComplete</strong></a> =1.</li>
</ol>

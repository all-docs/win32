<h1>Authoring a Fully Verified Signed Installation</h1>
<p>You can use these guidelines to cover an entire Windows Installer installation by a digital signature.</p>
<p>Authors of Windows Installer installations must adhere to the following to ensure that all parts of the installation are covered by a digital signature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use internal cabinet files, or use signed external cabinet files and correctly author the <a href="msidigitalsignature-table.html">MsiDigitalSignature table</a> and <a href="msidigitalcertificate-table.html">MsiDigitalCertificate table</a>.</li>
<li>Use only custom actions stored within the package or installed with the package.</li>
<li>Sign the installation package.</li>
<li>Include an <a href="msipatchcertificate-table.html">MsiPatchCertificate table</a> in the package. To enable <a href="user-account-control--uac--patching.html">User Account Control (UAC) Patching</a>, this table must contain information used to identify the signer certificates used to digitally sign patches. UAC patching enables the author of the installation package to identify digitally-signed patches that can be applied in the future by non-administrator users.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an example showing how to author a signed installation using automation, see <a href="authoring-a-fully-verified-signed-installation-using-automation.html">Authoring a Fully Verified Signed Installation Using Automation</a>.</p>

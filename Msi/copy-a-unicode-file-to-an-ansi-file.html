<h1>Copy a Unicode File to an ANSI File</h1>
<p>The VBScript file WiToAnsi.vbs is provided in the <a href="platform-sdk-components-for-windows-installer-developers.html">Windows SDK Components for Windows Installer Developers</a>. This sample shows how script is used to rewrite a Unicode text file as an ANSI text file.</p>
<p>Using this sample requires the CScript.exe or WScript.exe version of Windows Script Host. To use CScript.exe to run this sample, type a command line at the command prompt using the following syntax. Help is displayed if the first argument is /? or if too few arguments are specified. To redirect the output to a file, end the command line with VBS &gt; [<em>path to file</em>]. The sample returns a value of 0 for success, 1 if help is invoked, and 2 if the script fails.</p>
<p><strong>cscript WiToAnsi.vbs [path to Unicode file][path to ANSI file]</strong></p>
<p>Specify the Unicode text file that is being converted. Specify the ANSI text file that is being created. If no ANSI file is specified, the Unicode file is replaced.</p>
<p>For additional scripting examples, see <a href="windows-installer-scripting-examples.html">Windows Installer Scripting Examples</a>. For sample utilities that do not require Windows Script Host see <a href="windows-installer-development-tools.html">Windows Installer Development Tools</a>.</p>

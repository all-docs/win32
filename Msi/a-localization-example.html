<h1>A Localization Example</h1>
<p>This example illustrates how to localize the Windows Installer package described in <a href="an-installation-example.html">An Installation Example</a>. The original installation package is changed from an English into French language version.</p>
<p>The localization sample has the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The installation UI for the application MNP2000 should be changed from English to French.</li>
<li>The French version of MNP2000 includes Readme.txt and Help.txt files written in the French language.</li>
<li>The French version includes a list of travel agents in France that can provide tickets to Red Park Arena. This list (provided as a new file, Fre.txt) is not a part of the English version.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general procedure for localizing an installation is described in the section <a href="localizing-a-windows-installer-package.html">Localizing a Windows Installer Package</a>.</p>
<p>Copy the English version of MNP2000.msi and all the source files described in <a href="planning-the-installation.html">Planning the Installation</a> into a new folder. Change the name of the MNP2000.msi in the folder to MNPFren.msi. In the following sections you will modify this copy to localize the application into French.</p>

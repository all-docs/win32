<h1>Searching for Existing Applications, Files, Registry Entries or .ini File Entries</h1>
<p>Windows Installer can search for a specific file or directory during an installation. File or directory searches are used to determine whether a user has already installed a version of an application.</p>
<p><a href="appsearch-action.html">AppSearch Action</a> searches a user system for file signatures that are specified in the <a href="appsearch-table.html">AppSearch Table</a>. If the AppSearch action finds an installed file or directory with the specified signature, it sets a corresponding property, also specified in the AppSearch Table, to the location of the file or directory. When searching for a file, the file signature must also be listed in the <a href="signature-table.html">Signature Table</a>. If a file signature is listed in the AppSearch Table and is not listed in the Signature Table, the search looks for a directory, registry entry, or .ini file entry.</p>
<p>To expedite the search of a user computer, the Installer queries the following locator database tables in the order listed for a suggested search location:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the file signature is listed in the <a href="complocator-table.html">CompLocator Table</a>, the suggested search location is the key path of a component. If the signature is not listed in this table or not installed at the suggested location, the Installer queries the <a href="reglocator-table.html">RegLocator Table</a> for a suggested location.</li>
<li>If the file signature is listed in the <a href="reglocator-table.html">RegLocator Table</a>, the suggested search location is a key path written in the user registry. If the signature is not listed in this table or not installed at the suggested location, the Installer queries the <a href="inilocator-table.html">IniLocator Table</a> for a suggested location.</li>
<li>If the file signature is listed in the <a href="inilocator-table.html">IniLocator Table</a>, the suggested search location is a key path written in an .ini file present in the default Windows directory of a user system. If the signature is not listed in this table or not installed at the suggested location, the Installer queries the <a href="drlocator-table.html">DrLocator Table</a> for a suggested location.</li>
<li>If the file signature is listed in the <a href="drlocator-table.html">DrLocator Table</a>, the suggested search location is a path in the user directory tree. The depth of subdirectory levels to search below this location is also specified in this table.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first time the Installer finds the file signature at a suggested location, it stops searching for this file or directory, and sets the corresponding property in the <a href="appsearch-table.html">AppSearch Table</a>. For more information, see the following:</p>

<h1>Windows Installer Features</h1>
<p>A feature is a part of the application's total functionality that a user recognizes and may decide to install independently. For example, a feature could be a spell-checker, a thesaurus, or a set of clip art. Hierarchical relationships of parent and child features commonly exist such that if a child feature is installed, the parent feature is automatically installed as well.</p>

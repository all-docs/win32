<h1>Removing an Advertised Application</h1>
<p>To remove an application that has been installed in the advertised state, simply uninstall it using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msiinstallproducta"><strong>MsiInstallProduct</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msiconfigureproducta"><strong>MsiConfigureProduct</strong></a>. You can also remove an advertised application from the command line. See <a href="command-line-options.html">Command Line Options</a>.</p>
<p>Note that you may be unable to remove an advertised application if you have authored the package in such a way that running an installation is conditional upon the statement <strong>NOT Installed</strong>. An advertised application is not installed on the user's computer and the installer does not set the <a href="installed.html"><strong>Installed</strong></a> Property. The package must be authored so that advertised applications can be uninstalled.</p>

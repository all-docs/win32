<h1>Examples of Conditional Statement Syntax</h1>
<p>The following provides some common instances of conditional statements. For more information, see <a href="conditional-statement-syntax.html">Conditional Statement Syntax</a>.</p>
<h2>Run action on removal.</h2>
<p>For information, see <a href="conditioning-actions-to-run-during-removal.html">Conditioning Actions to Run During Removal</a>.</p>
<h2>Run action only if the product has not been installed.</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>NOT Installed
</code></pre>
<h2>Run action only if the product will be installed local. Do not run action on a reinstallation.</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>(&amp;FeatureName=3) AND NOT(!FeatureName=3)
</code></pre>
<p>The term &quot;&amp;FeatureName=3&quot; means the action is to install the feature local. The term &quot;NOT(!FeatureName=3)&quot; means the feature is not installed local.</p>
<h2>Run action only if the feature will be uninstalled.</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>(&amp;FeatureName=2) AND (!FeatureName=3)
</code></pre>
<p>This condition only checks for a transition of the feature from an installed state of local to the absent state.</p>
<h2>Run action only if the component was installed local, but is transitioning out of state.</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>(?ComponentName=3) AND ($ComponentName=2 OR $ComponentName=4)
</code></pre>
<p>The term &quot;?ComponetName=3&quot; means the component is installed local. The term &quot;$ComponentName=2&quot; means that the action state on the component is Absent. The term &quot;$ComponentName=4&quot; means that the action state on the component is run from source. Note that an action state of advertise is not valid for a component.</p>
<h2>Run action only on the reinstallation of a component.</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>?ComponentName=$ComponentName
</code></pre>
<h2>Run action only when a particular patch is applied.</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>PATCH AND PATCH &gt;&lt; MEDIASRCPROPNAME
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see the Remarks section on the <a href="patch.html"><strong>PATCH</strong></a> property page.</p>

<h1>File Searching</h1>
<p>During installation, there is often the need to search for a specific file. The installer has four standard search actions to serve this purpose. The <a href="appsearch-action.html">AppSearch action</a> uses the <a href="appsearch-table.html">AppSearch table</a> to determine if a file exists on a user's system. During an upgrade installation, the <a href="ccpsearch-action.html">CCPSearch action</a> and the <a href="rmccpsearch-action.html">RMCCPSearch action</a> can use their corresponding tables to check the user's system for a previous version of a product.</p>

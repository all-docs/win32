<h1>RemoveFolders Action</h1>
<p>The RemoveFolders action removes any folders linked to components set to be removed or run from source. These folders are removed only if they are empty. If a folder is removed, it is unregistered with the appropriate component identifier.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>The RemoveFolders action must come after the <a href="removefiles-action.html">RemoveFiles</a> action or any action that may remove files from folders.</p>
<h2>ActionData Messages</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description of action data</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>[1]</td>
<td>Identifier of removed folder.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The installer does not automatically remove the folders created by the <a href="createfolders-action.html">CreateFolders action</a> during an uninstallation of the application. The installer must be instructed to remove these folders by authoring the RemoveFolders action into the action sequence.</p>
<p>To specify the name and location of the folder, use the Directory_ column of the <a href="createfolder-table.html">CreateFolder table</a>. Each folder name in the CreateFolder table is assumed to be a property defining the folder location.</p>
<p>To specify the component owning the folder, use the ComponentId column of the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a>.</p>

<h1>A Small Update Patching Example</h1>
<p>This example illustrates how to create a <a href="patch-packages.html">patch package</a> that applies a <a href="small-updates.html">small update</a> to the sample installation package discussed in <a href="an-installation-example.html">An Installation Example</a>. A small update makes changes to one or more application files that are judged to be too minor to warrant changing the product code. For more information see <a href="patching-and-upgrades.html">Patching and Upgrades</a>.</p>
<p>This example illustrates how to create a Windows Installer patch package that updates the Concert feature of the hypothetical product MNP2000 to fix an error in the original product. The example patch package applies a small update to the product that does not require changing the product code. See the topic on <a href="major-upgrades.html">Major Upgrades</a> in the <a href="patching-and-upgrades.html">Patching and Upgrades</a> section for more information about major upgrades.</p>
<p>The sample upgrade package has the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>It corrects a minor error in the Concert schedule displayed by the Concert feature.</li>
<li>It updates the package code to reflect the installation package has changed.</li>
<li>The small update can be applied by patching the local installation of the product.</li>
</ul>

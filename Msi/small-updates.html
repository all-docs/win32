<h1>Small Updates</h1>
<p>A small update makes changes to one or more application files that are too minor to warrant changing the product code. A small update is also commonly referred to as a quick fix engineering (QFE) update. A small update does not permit reorganization of the feature-component tree.</p>
<p>A typical small update changes only one or two files or a registry key. Because a small update changes the information in the .msi file, the installation package code must be changed. The package code is stored in the <a href="revision-number-summary.html"><strong>Revision Number Summary</strong></a> property of the <a href="summary-information-stream.html">Summary Information Stream</a>.</p>
<p>The product code is never changed with a small update, so all of the changes introduced by a small update have to be consistent with the guidelines described in <a href="changing-the-product-code.html">Changing the Product Code</a>. An update requires a <a href="major-upgrades.html">major upgrade</a> to change the <a href="productcode.html"><strong>ProductCode</strong></a>. If it is necessary to differentiate between products without changing the product code, use a <a href="minor-upgrades.html">minor upgrade</a>.</p>

<h1>REINSTALL property</h1>
<p>The value of the <strong>REINSTALL</strong> property is a list of features delimited by commas that are to be reinstalled. The features listed must be present in the Feature column of the <a href="feature-table.html">Feature</a> table. To reinstall all features use REINSTALL=ALL on the command line.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Note that the feature names are case-sensitive.</p>
<p>If the <strong>REINSTALL</strong> property is set, the <a href="reinstallmode.html"><strong>REINSTALLMODE</strong></a> property should also be set, to indicate the type of reinstall to be performed. If the <strong>REINSTALLMODE</strong> property is not set, then by default all files that are currently installed are reinstalled, IF the currently installed file is a lesser version (or is not present). By default, no registry entries are rewritten.</p>
<p>Note that even if <strong>REINSTALL</strong> is set to ALL, only those features that were already installed previously are reinstalled. Thus, if <strong>REINSTALL</strong> is set for a product that is yet to be installed, no installation action will take place at all.</p>
<p>The installer always evaluates the following properties in the following order:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="addlocal.html"><strong>ADDLOCAL</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="remove.html"><strong>REMOVE</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="addsource.html"><strong>ADDSOURCE</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="adddefault.html"><strong>ADDDEFAULT</strong></a></li>
<li><strong>REINSTALL</strong></li>
<li><a href="advertise.html"><strong>ADVERTISE</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="compaddlocal.html"><strong>COMPADDLOCAL</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="compaddsource.html"><strong>COMPADDSOURCE</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="fileaddlocal.html"><strong>FILEADDLOCAL</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="fileaddsource.html"><strong>FILEADDSOURCE</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="fileadddefault.html"><strong>FILEADDDEFAULT</strong></a></li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if the command line specifies: ADDLOCAL=ALL, ADDSOURCE = MyFeature, all the features are first set to run-local and then MyFeature is set to run-from-source. If the command line is: ADDSOURCE=ALL, ADDLOCAL=MyFeature, first MyFeature is set to run-local, and then when ADDSOURCE=ALL is evaluated, all features (including MyFeature) are reset to run-from-source.</p>
<p>The installer sets the <a href="preselected.html"><strong>Preselected</strong></a> property to a value of &quot;1&quot; during the resumption of a suspended installation or when any of the above properties are specified on the command line.</p>

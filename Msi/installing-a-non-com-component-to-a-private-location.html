<h1>Installing a non-COM Component to a Private Location</h1>
<p>To force a client application to always use the same copy of a non-COM server, author the application's installation package to specify an <a href="isolated-components.html">isolated components</a> relationship between the server and client. This installs a private copy of the server component to a location used exclusively by the client application. Do the following when authoring the package:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put the server DLL and the .exe client in separate components.</li>
<li>Enter a record in the <a href="isolatedcomponent-table.html">IsolatedComponent table</a> with the client component in the Component_Shared column and the client application in the Component_Application column. Include the <a href="isolatecomponents-action.html">IsolateComponents action</a> in the sequence tables.</li>
<li>Set the msidbComponentAttributesSharedDllRefCount bit in the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a> record for Component_Shared. The installer requires this global refcount on the shared location to protect the shared files and registration in cases where there is sharing with other installation technologies.</li>
<li>Avoid authoring a shared registered path across components.</li>
</ul>

<h1>InstallExecuteAgain Action</h1>
<p>The InstallExecuteAgain action runs a script containing all operations in the action sequence since either the start of the installation or the last InstallExecuteAgain action or the last <a href="installexecute-action.html">InstallExecute action</a>. The InstallExecute action updates the system without ending the transaction. InstallExecuteAgain performs the same operation as the <a href="installexecute-action.html">InstallExecute action</a> but should only be used after InstallExecute.</p>
<p>InstallExecuteAgain should always be set so that it does not run during removal. For information, see <a href="using-properties-in-conditional-statements.html">Using Properties in Conditional Statements</a>.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>The InstallExecute action comes between the <a href="installinitialize-action.html">InstallInitialize action</a> and the <a href="installfinalize-action.html">InstallFinalize action</a>.</p>
<h2>ActionData Messages</h2>
<p>There are no ActionData messages.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The InstallExecuteAgain action does the same thing as the <a href="installexecute-action.html">InstallExecute action</a>. Because the sequence tables have only one primary key, the Action column, the same action cannot be repeated in a particular sequence table. Two actions exist that do the same thing, InstallExecute and InstallExecuteAgain, for cases where the functionality of InstallExecute is needed twice in the <a href="installexecutesequence-table.html">InstallExecuteSequence table</a>. For more information, see <a href="using-a-sequence-table.html">Using a Sequence Table</a>.</p>

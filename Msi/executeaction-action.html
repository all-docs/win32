<h1>ExecuteAction Action</h1>
<p>The ExecuteAction action initiates the execution sequence using the <a href="executeaction.html"><strong>EXECUTEACTION</strong></a> property to determine which type of installation to perform.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>This action should be sequenced after all information collection necessary to begin the installation is complete. Additional actions may be sequenced after ExecuteAction action in the <a href="installuisequence-table.html">InstallUISequence table</a>, and <a href="adminuisequence-table.html">AdminUISequence table</a>. A sequence will typically begin with <a href="c-gly.html"><em>costing</em></a> actions, such as the <a href="costinitialize-action.html">CostInitialize action</a>, followed by the user interface actions, and then the ExecuteAction action.</p>
<h2>ActionData Messages</h2>
<p>There are no ActionData messages.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The ExecuteAction action is run with system privileges if the installer service is enabled. The top-level actions, such as the <a href="install-action.html">INSTALL action</a>, <a href="advertise-action.html">ADVERTISE action</a>, and <a href="admin-action.html">ADMIN action</a> include internal logic that determines whether calling the ExecuteAction action requires either the execution sequence or the user interface sequence to run.</p>

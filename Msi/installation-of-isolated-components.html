<h1>Installation of Isolated Components</h1>
<p>Windows Installer performs the following actions during installation of an application when the package contains isolated components. Typically, Component_Shared is a DLL that is shared by Component_Application and other client executables.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy the files of Component_Shared into the same folder as Component_Application only if Component_Application is also being installed.</li>
<li>Create a zero-byte file with the short file name of the key file of Component_Application. Locate this file in the same folder as Component_Application. Append the extension .LOCAL to this file name.</li>
<li>Increment the SharedDLL refcount if the msidbComponentAttributesSharedDllRefCount bit is set in the Attributes column of the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a>.</li>
<li>Register Component_Application as a client of Component_Shared and register a key path pointing to the shared location of Component_Shared.</li>
<li>Install all of the resources of Component_Application as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Component_Shared or its key file is already installed on the computer do not copy files to the shared location of Component_Shared.</p>
<p>If Component_Shared or its key file is not yet installed on the computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy the files of Component_Shared to the shared location.</li>
<li>Process all install actions for Component_Shared.</li>
<li>If Component_Shared is a COM component, register the full COM path such that the syntax [$Component] and [#FileKey] point to the shared location of Component_Shared.</li>
</ul>

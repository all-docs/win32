<h1>An Upgrade Example</h1>
<p>The following sections present an example of authoring an upgrade package for the application described in <a href="an-installation-example.html">An Installation Example</a>. An example of a minimal user interface for this sample is provided in the <a href="platform-sdk-components-for-windows-installer-developers.html">Windows SDK Components for Windows Installer Developers</a> as the file Uisample.msi. If you have the SDK, you have access to all the tools and data necessary to reproduce the sample installation package, user interface, and sample upgrade package.</p>
<p>This example illustrates how to create a Windows Installer package that upgrades the hypothetical product MNP2000 to a new product called MNP2001. The example upgrade package applies a major upgrade to the product which requires changing the product code. For more information about major upgrades, see the topic on <a href="major-upgrades.html">Major Upgrades</a> in the <a href="patching-and-upgrades.html">Patching and Upgrades</a> section.</p>
<p>The sample upgrade package has the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To qualify to receive this upgrade to MNP2001, a user must have previously installed the 1.0 to 1.4 (inclusive) versions of English language MNP2000 using Windows Installer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a user attempts to install the upgrade package, the upgrade functionality of Windows Installer searches the user's computer for any products that qualify for the upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windows Installer migrates all the of the original product's feature settings to the upgraded product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installer removes all obsolete features from the user's computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The installer installs all new features belonging to the upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An uninstall of the upgrade package removes the product from the user's computer, and does not restore the earlier version of the product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sample upgrade updates shortcuts to new files and features.</p>

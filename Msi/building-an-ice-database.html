<h1>Building an ICE Database</h1>
<p>After selecting the appropriate <a href="internal-consistency-evaluators-ices.html">ICEs</a> for validation, a developer must collect the custom actions together into an ICE database. A .cub file is a standard .msi database that contains only ICEs and their required tables. A .cub file cannot be installed and is used only to store and provide access to ICE custom actions.</p>
<p>A .cub file contains the following database tables.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Table</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="binary-table.html">Binary</a></td>
<td>The script files, DLLs, and EXEs of the ICE customs actions that are referenced in the CustomAction table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="customaction-table.html">CustomAction</a></td>
<td>Each record in this table corresponds to an ICE custom action included in the .cub file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_ICESequence</td>
<td>This table lists the ICE customs actions included in the .cub file in their execution sequence. The ICE custom actions listed in this table are executed by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msiquery/nf-msiquery-msisequencea"><strong>MsiSequence</strong></a>, or individually executed using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msiquery/nf-msiquery-msidoactiona"><strong>MsiDoAction</strong></a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="-validation-table.html">_Validation</a></td>
<td>This table contains the .cub file entries that are to be merged into the _Validation table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_Special</td>
<td>Any special processing tables required by particular ICE custom actions must be included in the .cub file. The name of these tables must have a leading underscore.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

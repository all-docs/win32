<h1>Rollback Installation</h1>
<p>When the Windows Installer processes the installation script for the installation of a product or application, it simultaneously generates a rollback script and saves a copy of every file deleted during the installation. These files are kept in a hidden system directory and are automatically deleted once the installation is successfully completed. If however the installation is unsuccessful, the installer automatically performs a rollback installation that returns the system to its original state.</p>
<p>Automatic rollback of an unsuccessful installation is the default behavior of the installer. To disable rollback during an installation use one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="-disablerollback.html"><strong>DISABLEROLLBACK Property</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="promptrollbackcost.html"><strong>PROMPTROLLBACKCOST Property</strong></a></li>
<li><a href="disablerollback-action.html">DisableRollback Action</a></li>
<li><a href="disablerollback.html">DisableRollback</a></li>
<li><a href="enablerollback-controlevent.html">EnableRollback ControlEvent</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever rollback is disabled, the installer sets the <a href="rollbackdisabled.html"><strong>RollbackDisabled</strong></a> property.</p>
<p>If an installation uses <a href="custom-actions.html">custom actions</a>, additional authoring of the installation package is required to use rollback functionality. For more information, see <a href="rollback-custom-actions.html">Rollback Custom Actions</a>.</p>

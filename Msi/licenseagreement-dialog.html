<h1>LicenseAgreement Dialog</h1>
<p>This modal dialog box displays the license agreement to the user. Typically the dialog box displays the text of the agreement using a <a href="scrollabletext-control.html">ScrollableText control</a> and a pair of option buttons that let the user accept or reject the agreement. For legal reasons it is advisable that neither button be presented to the user as already selected by default. This forces the user to make an active choice. Authors commonly use a <a href="radiobuttongroup-control.html">RadioButtonGroup control</a> for this purpose. Note however that the focus on a dialog box does not move to a RadioButtonGroup control until one of the buttons in the group has been selected.</p>

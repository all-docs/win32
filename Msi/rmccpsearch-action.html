<h1>RMCCPSearch Action</h1>
<p>The RMCCPSearch action uses file signatures to validate that qualifying products are installed on a system before an upgrade installation is performed.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>RMCCPSearch action should be authored into the <a href="installuisequence-table.html">InstallUISequence table</a> and <a href="installexecutesequence-table.html">InstallExecuteSequence table</a>. The installer prevents RMCCPSearch from running in the InstallExecuteSequence sequence if the action has already run in InstallUISequence sequence.</p>
<h2>ActionData Messages</h2>
<p>There are no ActionData messages.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The RMCCPSearch action requires the <a href="ccp-drive.html"><strong>CCP_DRIVE</strong></a> property to be set to the root path on the removable <a href="v-gly.html"><em>volume</em></a> that has the installation for any of the qualifying products.</p>
<p>Each file signature in the CCPSearch table is searched for under the path referred to by the <a href="ccp-drive.html"><strong>CCP_DRIVE</strong></a> property using the <a href="drlocator-table.html">DrLocator</a> table. The absence of the signature from the <a href="signature-table.html">Signature</a> table denotes a directory. If any signature is determined to exist, the RMCCPSearch action terminates.</p>

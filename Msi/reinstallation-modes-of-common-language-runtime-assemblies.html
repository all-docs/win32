<h1>Reinstallation Modes of Common Language Runtime Assemblies</h1>
<p>Common language runtime assemblies that are installed to the global assembly cache must have identical files in all occurrences of the assembly. This means that the reinstallation modes used by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msireinstallfeaturea"><strong>MsiReinstallFeature</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msireinstallproducta"><strong>MsiReinstallProduct</strong></a> must have different meanings for regular components and common language runtime assemblies. The following definitions of reinstall modes apply to common language runtime assemblies.</p>

<h1>Qualified Components</h1>
<p>A qualified component is a method of single-level indirection, similar to a pointer. Qualified components are primarily used to group components with parallel functionality into categories. For example, if you have 30 components listed in the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a> that are the same Microsoft Word fax template localized into 30 languages, you can group these together into a category of qualified components by using the <a href="publishcomponent-table.html">PublishComponent table</a>.</p>
<p>Qualified components are entered in the Component table in the same way as ordinary components. Every component must have a unique component ID GUID and component identifier specified in the Component table. In addition, qualified components are associated with a category GUID and a text-string qualifier in the PublishComponent table. Qualified components are referenced by the category GUID and the qualifier, which just points to the ordinary component in the Component table.</p>
<p>For example, a qualified component ID GUID can point to different language versions of a resource DLL. In this case, the group of localized resource DLLs comprises the category and the numeric locale identifiers (LCID) strings are commonly used as the qualifiers. A developer could author an installation package that uses these qualified components to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the path to a particular language version of the resource DLL using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msiprovidequalifiedcomponenta"><strong>MsiProvideQualifiedComponent</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msiprovidequalifiedcomponentexa"><strong>MsiProvideQualifiedComponentEx</strong></a> and install the resource.</li>
<li>Determine all of the language versions of the resource DLL that are present by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msi/nf-msi-msienumcomponentqualifiersa"><strong>MsiEnumComponentQualifiers</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Prepare the application to support additional languages. A future language pack for the application can use the qualified component to add more language versions of the resource DLL.</li>
</ul>

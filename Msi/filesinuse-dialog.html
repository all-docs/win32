<h1>FilesInUse Dialog</h1>
<p>A FilesInUse dialog box alerts the user of processes currently running files that must be overwritten or deleted by the installation. This gives the user the opportunity to shut down these processes and avoid having to reboot the computer to complete the replacement or deletion of these files. See <a href="system-reboots.html">System Reboots</a>.</p>
<p>This dialog box will be created as required by the <a href="installvalidate-action.html">InstallValidate action</a>.</p>

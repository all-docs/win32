<h1>ICE65</h1>
<p>ICE65 checks that the <a href="environment-table.html">Environment table</a> does not have invalid prefix or append values.</p>
<p>Failure to fix a warning or error reported by ICE65 generally leads to problems in install, uninstall, or repair of the environment variable. For example, only some values of a particular variable may be removed if one or more of the values for that variable have a trailing separator.</p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>ICE65 posts a warning or an error if the environment table has invalid prefix or append values.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>ICE65 reports the following error and warning for the example shown.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>The environment variable 'Var3' has a separator beginning or ending its value.
</code></pre>
<p>The trailing null at the end of the value ([~]) marks this value to be prepended to any existing value. The character immediately before the null (a semicolon) becomes the separator for this value. This value has a semicolon at the beginning of the string as well.</p>
<p>To fix this error, simply delete the leading semicolon.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>WARNING: The environment variable 'Var2' has an alphanumeric separator
</code></pre>
<p>The leading null in the value ([~]) marks this value to be appended to any existing value. The character immediately after the null becomes the separator for this value. In this case, that character is the letter &quot;e&quot;, which also occurs in the middle of the string to be appended. This condition (having a separator that is the same as a character within the string to be appended) can cause unpredictable results.</p>
<p>The letter &quot;e&quot;, being a common letter, is likely to be found in the value. A better choice would be &quot;;&quot; or some other non-alphanumeric character. (However, if the value is a path, then &quot;:&quot; and &quot;\&quot; and &quot;.&quot; are risky choices.)</p>
<p>To fix this warning, use a different separator character.</p>

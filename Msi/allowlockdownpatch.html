<h1>AllowLockdownPatch</h1>
<p>If this per-machine <a href="system-policy.html">system policy</a> is not set, only administrators can patch existing products that were installed using elevated privileges. If AllowLockdownPatch is set to &quot;1&quot;, nonadministrative users can, in some cases, apply patches to products while running an installation using elevated privileges. With the policy set, the patch can install <a href="minor-upgrades.html">minor upgrades</a> while running an installation using elevated privileges, the patch cannot install <a href="major-upgrades.html">major upgrades</a>. Setting this policy also enables nonadministrative users to run programs at LocalSystem privileges during an elevated installation.</p>
<p>The default setting is recommended to ensure a secure environment.</p>
<h2>Registry Key</h2>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>Software</strong>\<strong>Policies</strong>\<strong>Microsoft</strong>\<strong>Windows</strong>\<strong>Installer</strong></p>
<h2>Data Type</h2>
<p><strong>REG_DWORD</strong></p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Any user can apply a patch during a nonelevated installation. Setting this per-machine <a href="system-policy.html">system policy</a> to &quot;1&quot; gives nonadministrative users the additional flexibility of applying patches to any product during an elevated installation. If this policy is not set, nonadministrative users cannot apply a patch to assigned or published applications.</p>
<p>Setting this policy also enables nonadministrative users to run arbitrary programs at LocalSystem privileges if they have a Windows Installer patch package that installs or launches those programs.</p>

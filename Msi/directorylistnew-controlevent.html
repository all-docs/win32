<h1>DirectoryListNew ControlEvent</h1>
<p>This event notifies the <a href="directorylist-control.html">DirectoryList control</a> that a new folder must be created; it creates the new folder, and selects the name field of the folder for editing. The default name of the new folder may be authored in the <a href="uitext-table.html">UIText table</a>. Enter &quot;NewFolder&quot; into the Key column. Enter the value for the default name of the new folder into the Text column. This value must be in the form of a <a href="filename.html">Filename</a> column data type and use the SFN|LFN syntax. If this value is not present in the UIText table or is an invalid value, the installer uses a default value of &quot;Fldr|New Folder.&quot; For related information, see <a href="browse-dialog.html">Browse Dialog</a>.</p>
<p>This event should be published by a <a href="pushbutton-control.html">PushButton Control</a> located on the same dialog box as the control subscribing to this event. The event should be authored in the <a href="controlevent-table.html">ControlEvent table</a>.</p>
<p>This ControlEvent requires the user interface to be run at the <a href="f-gly.html"><em>full UI</em></a> level. This event will not work with a <a href="r-gly.html"><em>reduced UI</em></a> or <a href="b-gly.html"><em>basic UI</em></a>. For information, see <a href="user-interface-levels.html">User Interface Levels</a>.</p>
<p>Note that if this ControlEvent is called again when a new folder already exists, a second new folder will not be created. In this case, calling DirectoryListNew selects the existing new folder's name for editing.</p>

<h1>Reinstallation of Isolated Components</h1>
<p>Windows Installer performs the following actions during reinstallation of an application when the package contains isolated components. Typically, Component_Shared is a DLL that is shared by Component_Application and other client executables.</p>
<h2>Reinstallation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reinstall of the files of Component_Shared into the same folder as Component_Application only if Component_Application is also being reinstalled.</li>
<li>Do not increment the client list of Component_Shared and do not increment the SharedDLL count.</li>
<li>Recreate the zero-byte file with the short file name of the key file of Component_Application. This file must be located in the same folder as Component_Application and have the extension .LOCAL.</li>
<li>Reinstall all of the resources of Component_Application as usual.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the SharedDLL refcount for Component_Shared is more than 1, or if other products remain on the client list of Component_Shared:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstall no files to the shared location of Component_Shared.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the SharedDLL refcount for Component_Shared equals 1, or if there are no other remaining clients of Component_Shared:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstall of the files of Component_Shared into the shared location using the <a href="file-versioning-rules.html">File Versioning Rules</a>.</li>
<li>Process all reinstall actions for Component_Shared.</li>
<li>If Component_Shared is a COM component, register the full COM path such that the installer syntaxes [$Component] and [#FileKey] point to the shared location of Component_Shared.</li>
</ul>

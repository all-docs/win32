<h1>Using Isolated Components</h1>
<p>By using <a href="isolated-components.html">isolated components</a>, authors of installation packages can specify that the installer copy the shared files of an application directly into the application's folder rather than to a shared location. This private set of files are then used exclusively by the application.</p>

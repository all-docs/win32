<h1>Downloading an Installation from the Internet</h1>
<p>Windows Installer accepts a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) as a valid source for an installation. Windows Installer can install packages, patches, and transforms from a URL location.</p>
<p>If the installation database is at a URL, the installer downloads the database to a cache location before starting the installation. The installer also downloads the files and cabinet files from the Internet source that are appropriate for the user's selections. See <a href="a-url-based-windows-installer-installation-example.html">A URL-based Windows Installer Installation Example</a> for more information.</p>
<p>For example, to install a package with a source located on a web server at <a href="https://server/share/package.msi">https://server/share/package.msi</a>, you can use the <a href="command-line-options.html">command line</a> options to install the package and set <a href="public-properties.html">public</a> properties.</p>
<p>msiexec /i <a href="https://server/share/package.msi">https://server/share/package.msi</a> <em>PROPERTY=VALUE</em></p>
<p>A command line like the one previously shown should be passed to the installer to start an installation from a web browser. In general, you should not download and install the package simply by double-clicking the .msi file from within the browser. This downloads the .msi file to the temporary Internet files folder and passes the following command to the installer:</p>
<p><strong>msiexec /i c:\windows\temporary internet files\package.msi</strong></p>
<p>The installation fails if the package requires any external source files or cabinets because these are not located in the same location as the .msi file.</p>
<p>Note that because the <a href="installer-object.html"><strong>Installer</strong></a> object is not marked as <a href="safeforscripting.html">SafeForScripting</a> on the user's computer, users need to adjust their browser security settings for the example to work correctly.</p>
<p>The <a href="installer-installproduct.html"><strong>InstallProduct</strong></a> method could be used to run the previous command from a browser as an on-click event.</p>

<p>Note that because some web servers are case sensitive, the FileName field in the <a href="file-table.html">File</a> table must match the case of the source files exactly to ensure support of Internet downloads.</p>

<h2>Available Internet Protocols</h2>
<p>Beginning with Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP, the installer can use the HTTP, HTTPS and FILE protocols. The installer does not support the FTP and GOPHER protocols.</p>
<p>Windows Installer version 2.0 can use the HTTP, FILE, and FTP protocols and cannot use the HTTPS and GOPHER protocols.</p>

<h1>Selection Dialog</h1>
<p>This modal dialog box enables users to select particular items.</p>
<p>A Selection Dialog box contains a <a href="selectiontree-control.html">SelectionTree control</a> that publishes several ControlEvents. Commonly these ControlEvents are subscribed to by <a href="text-control.html">Text</a>, <a href="icon-control.html">Icon</a>, or <a href="bitmap-control.html">Bitmap</a> controls that display a description, the size, the path, and the icon of the highlighted item.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="pushbutton-control.html">PushButton control</a> on the dialog box that publishes the <a href="selectionbrowse-controlevent.html">SelectionBrowse ControlEvent</a> and spawns a <a href="browse-dialog.html">Browse Dialog</a>. The Browse control enables the user to select a directory.</p>
<p>The selection tree is populated only after the <a href="costinitialize-action.html">CostInitialize action</a> and <a href="costfinalize-action.html">CostFinalize action</a> are called.</p>
<p>A Selection dialog box is commonly used to select features. The features are listed as items in a SelectionTree control and labeled with the short string of text appearing in the Title column of the <a href="feature-table.html">Feature table</a>. The text string in the Description column of the Feature table is published as a <a href="selectiondescription-controlevent.html">SelectionDescription ControlEvent</a> and displayed by a <a href="text-control.html">Text control</a> in the Selection Dialog box. The Selection tree control also publishes the handle to the icon of the highlighted item.</p>

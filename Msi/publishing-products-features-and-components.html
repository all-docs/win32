<h1>Publishing Products, Features, and Components</h1>
<p>To <a href="components-and-features.html">publish</a> a product, component, or feature, use one of the publishing actions. The <a href="publishproduct-action.html">PublishProduct action</a> registers the product information with the system. After executing the PublishProduct action, publish the components with the <a href="publishcomponents-action.html">PublishComponents action</a>, which in turn uses the <a href="publishcomponent-table.html">PublishComponent table</a> to determine the components that are set as advertised. To publish on a per-feature basis, invoke the <a href="publishfeatures-action.html">PublishFeatures action</a>. This action uses the <a href="featurecomponents-table.html">FeatureComponents table</a> as data to resolve which features are advertised.</p>
<p>There are also two corresponding actions that unpublish a feature or a component: the <a href="unpublishcomponents-action.html">UnpublishComponents action</a> and the <a href="unpublishfeatures-action.html">UnpublishFeatures action</a>.</p>

<h1>LaunchConditions Action</h1>
<p>The LaunchConditions action queries the <a href="launchcondition-table.html">LaunchCondition table</a> and evaluates each conditional statement recorded there. If any of these conditional statements fail, an error message is displayed to the user and the installation is terminated.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>The LaunchConditions action is optional. This action is normally the first in the sequence, but the <a href="appsearch-action.html">AppSearch Action</a> may be sequenced before the LaunchConditions action. If there are launch conditions that do not apply to all installation modes, the appropriate installation mode property should be used in a conditional expression in the appropriate sequence table.</p>
<h2>ActionData Messages</h2>
<p>There are no ActionData messages.</p>

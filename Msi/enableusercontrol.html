<h1>EnableUserControl</h1>
<p>In the case of a managed installation, the package author may need to limit which public properties are passed to the server side and can be changed by a user that is not a system administrator. Some restrictions are commonly necessary to maintain a secure environment when the installation requires the installer to use elevated privileges.</p>
<p>If this per-machine <a href="system-policy.html">system policy</a> is set to &quot;1&quot;, then the installer can pass all <a href="public-properties.html">public properties</a> to the server side during a managed installation using elevated privileges. Setting this policy has the same effect as setting the <strong>EnableUserControl</strong> property. Setting this policy allows all public properties to be passed to the service and to be changeable by nonadministrative users. By default, this policy is not enabled; only restricted public properties are passed to the server side and changeable by a nonadministrative user. All other public properties are ignored.</p>
<p>If the operating system is WindowsÂ 2000, the user is not a system administrator, and the application or product is being installed with elevated privileges, then a user that is not a system administrator can only override an approved list of restricted public properties. For more information see <a href="restricted-public-properties.html">Restricted Public Properties</a>.</p>

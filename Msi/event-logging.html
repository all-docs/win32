<h1>Event Logging (Windows Installer)</h1>
<p><a href="../events/windows-events.html">Windows Events</a> provides a standard, centralized way for applications (and the operating system) to record important software and hardware events. The event-logging service stores events from various sources in a single collection called an <em>event log</em>. Prior to WindowsÂ Vista, you would use either <a href="../etw/event-tracing-portal.html">Event Tracing for Windows</a> (ETW) or <a href="../eventlog/event-logging.html">Event Logging</a> to log events. WindowsÂ Vista introduced a new eventing model that unifies both ETW and the <a href="../wes/windows-event-log.html">Windows Event Log</a> API.</p>
<p>The installer also writes entries into the event log. These record events such as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Success or failure of the installation; removal or repair of a product.</li>
<li>Errors that occur during product configuration.</li>
<li>Detection of corrupted configuration data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a large amount of information is written, the Event Log file can become full and the installer displays the message, &quot;The Application log file is full.&quot;</p>
<p>The installer may write the following entries in the event log. All event log messages have a unique event ID. All general errors authored in the <a href="error-table.html">Error table</a> that are returned for an installation that fails are logged in the Application Event Log with a message ID equal to the Error + 10,000. For example, the error number in the Error table for an installation completed successfully is 1707. The successful installation is logged in the Application Event Log with a message ID of 11707 (1707 + 10,000).</p>
<p>For information about how to enable verbose logging on a user's computer when troubleshooting deployment, see <a href="windows-installer-best-practices.html">Windows Installer Best Practices</a>.</p>

<p>You can import localized errors strings for events into your database by using Msidb.exe or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msiquery/nf-msiquery-msidatabaseimporta"><strong>MsiDatabaseImport</strong></a>. The SDK includes localized resource strings for each of the languages listed in the <a href="localizing-the-error-and-actiontext-tables.html">Localizing the Error and ActionText Tables</a> section. If the error strings corresponding to events are not populated, the installer loads localized strings for the language specified by the <a href="productlanguage.html"><strong>ProductLanguage</strong></a> property.</p>

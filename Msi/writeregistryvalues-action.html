<h1>WriteRegistryValues Action</h1>
<p>The WriteRegistryValues action sets up an application's registry information. The registry information is gated by the <a href="component-table.html">Component table</a>. A registry value is written to the registry if the corresponding component has been set to be installed either locally or as run from source. For more information, see <a href="registry-table.html">Registry table</a>.</p>
<h2>Sequence Restrictions</h2>
<p>The <a href="installvalidate-action.html">InstallValidate action</a> must come before the WriteRegistryValues action. If there is a <a href="removeregistryvalues-action.html">RemoveRegistryValues action</a>, then it must come before the WriteRegistryValues action.</p>
<p>A custom action can be used to add rows to the <a href="registry-table.html">Registry table</a> during an installation, uninstallation, or repair transaction. These rows do not persist in the Registry table and the information is only available during the current transaction. The custom action must therefore be run in every installation, uninstallation, or repair transaction that requires the information in these additional rows. The custom action must come before the <a href="removeregistryvalues-action.html">RemoveRegistryValues</a> and WriteRegistryValues actions in the action sequence.</p>

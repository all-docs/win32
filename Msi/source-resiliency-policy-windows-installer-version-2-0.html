<h1>Source Resiliency Policy</h1>
<p>The installer begins searching for a source by checking the most recently used source location in the source list, then the list of network sources, then media sources, and finally URL sources. For more information, see <a href="source-resiliency.html">Source Resiliency</a>. If the search fails, the installer may present a <a href="browse-dialog.html">Browse Dialog</a> enabling the user to search for the source manually. The browse dialog box cannot be displayed if the <a href="user-interface-levels.html">user interface levels</a> is set to None. An administrator controls the display of the browse dialog box to users by setting system policy.</p>
<p>With Windows Installer, nonadministrators by default cannot use the browse dialog box to locate managed application sources on media and cannot install managed applications. An administrator enables a nonadministrator to browse or install managed applications from media by using the <a href="allowlockdownbrowse.html">AllowLockdownBrowse</a> and <a href="allowlockdownmedia.html">AllowLockdownMedia</a> policies. An administrator disables the capability to browse or install applications from media by using the <a href="disablebrowse.html">DisAbleBrowse</a> and <a href="disablemedia.html">DisAbleMedia</a> policies.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the use of these system policies in Windows Installer.</p>

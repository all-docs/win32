<h1>Exposing Owner-Drawn List Box Items</h1>
<p>Application developers do not need to implement <a href="/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible"><strong>IAccessible</strong></a> to expose the items in an owner-drawn list box that has the style <strong>LBS_HASSTRINGS</strong> because Microsoft Active Accessibility exposes the items in list boxes with this style. The items in an owner-drawn list box with the <strong>LBS_HASSTRINGS</strong> style are displayed as text. However, this style is also used with owner-drawn list boxes that do not display text so that the list box items are exposed by Microsoft Active Accessibility.</p>
<p>To allow Microsoft Active Accessibility to expose the items in an owner-drawn list box that does not display text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <strong>LBS_HASSTRINGS</strong> style when creating the list box.</li>
<li>Create a textual counterpart that names or describes each item in the list box.</li>
<li>When adding items to the owner-drawn list box, use the <a href="../controls/lb-addstring.html">LB_ADDSTRING</a> message to add the text that you want Microsoft Active Accessibility to expose. This text is not displayed, so it is not part of the owner-drawn data. Add the owner-drawn item data using the <a href="../controls/lb-setitemdata.html">LB_SETITEMDATA</a> message.</li>
</ul>
<p>When using the above method, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use the <strong>LBS_SORT</strong> style, the list box is sorted using the supplied strings and not the <a href="../controls/wm-compareitem.html">WM_COMPAREITEM</a> callback procedure.</li>
<li>With owner-drawn variable list boxes created with the style <strong>LBS_OWNERDRAWVARIABLE</strong>, use a global variable or some other mechanism to keep track of when the <strong>itemData member</strong> of the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-measureitemstruct">MEASUREITEMSTRUCT</a> is valid. The global variable is needed because the system sends the <a href="../controls/wm-measureitem.html">WM_MEASUREITEM</a> message as soon as the string is added but before the item data is attached, and at this point the <strong>itemData</strong> member is not valid.</li>
<li>To change the string for an item in a list box with the <strong>LBS_HASSTRINGS</strong> style, delete the item with the <a href="../controls/lb-deletestring.html">LB_DELETESTRING</a> message and add the new string with the LB_ADDSTRING message.</li>
</ul>

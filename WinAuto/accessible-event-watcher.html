<h1>Accessibility tools - AccEvent (Accessible Event Watcher)</h1>
<p><strong>AccEvent (Accessible Event Watcher)</strong> lets developers and testers to validate that an application's UI elements raise proper Microsoft UI Automation and Microsoft Active Accessibility events when UI changes occur. Changes in the UI can occur when focus changes, or when a UI element is invoked, selected, or has a state or property change.</p>
<p><strong>AccEvent</strong> is installed with the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK). It is located in the \bin\<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder of the SDK installation path (Accevent.exe).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
<strong>AccEvent</strong> is a legacy tool. We recommend using <a href="https://accessibilityinsights.io/">Accessibility Insights</a> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>AccEvent</strong> can be used to examine accessibility data on systems that don't have UI Automation, it was originally written for Microsoft Active Accessibility. To examine UI Automation, UI Automation must be present on the system. For more information, see the &quot;Requirements&quot; section of <a href="entry-uiauto-win32.html">UI Automation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>AccEvent</strong> is installed as part of the overall set of tools in the Windows SDK, it is not distributed as a separate exe download. The Windows SDK includes all of the accessibility-related tools documented in this section. <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/">Get the Windows SDK.</a> (There's also an SDK download archive linked from that page, if you need a previous version.)</p>
<p>To run <strong>AccEvent</strong>, find AccEvent.exe in the \bin\<!-- raw HTML omitted --> folder and run it (you don't typically have to run as administrator).</p>
<h2>The Accessible Event Watcher Window</h2>
<p>When you launch <strong>AccEvent</strong>, the main window is displayed. The main <strong>AccEvent</strong> window displays the UI Automation or Microsoft Active Accessibility events raised by applications that are running. The main window has the following major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Title bar. Displays the current operating mode and state.</li>
<li>Menu bar. Provides access to <strong>AccEvent</strong> functionality.</li>
<li>Data view. Displays information about each event, including the event ID and selected properties of the UI element that raised the event.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AccEvent</strong> has a graphical user interface only; there are no command line arguments for this tool, but you could use other tools to process the output log as text.</p>
<p>The following image shows the main <strong>AccEvent</strong> window.</p>

<h1>MissingItemInTabOrder</h1>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>This element appears to be tabbable but is not in the tab order.</p>
<h2>Type</h2>
<p>Error</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A focusable element is not accessible using standard keyboard navigation (Tab or Shift+Tab). For example, the element has not been marked as a tab stop or assigned a tab index. This issue causes problems for people who rely on a screen-reader and keyboard for navigation because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The element is not discoverable.</li>
<li>If the element is a child of a custom list control, cues indicating the child element can be navigated using the Arrow or Page keys may be missing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible causes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The MSAA role of the element or its parent is not set correctly. For example, if all list items in a list view control are not exposed through MSAA as a ROLE_SYSTEM_LISTITEM, the verification fails because the list items are not accessible using the Tab key.</li>
<li>The element or its parent is a custom control that doesn't implement tabbing correctly. For example, the MSAA State property is never set to STATE_SYSTEM_FOCUSABLE.</li>
<li>An element that acts as a container for other elements was selected for verification but does not support keyboard navigation itself. For example, a toolbar and its child elements are not accessible using the TAB key.</li>
</ul>

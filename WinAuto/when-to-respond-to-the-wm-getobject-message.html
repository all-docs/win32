<h1>When to Respond to the WM_GETOBJECT Message</h1>
<p>If an application supports Microsoft Active Accessibility or UI Automation for a UI element, the application must not respond to the <a href="wm-getobject.html"><strong>WM_GETOBJECT</strong></a> message before the object that represents the UI element is fully initialized, or after the application has begun to close. When an application creates a new window, the system raises the <a href="event-constants.html"><strong>EVENT_OBJECT_CREATE</strong></a> WinEvent to notify clients before sending the <a href="/windows/desktop/winmsg/wm-create"><strong>WM_CREATE</strong></a> message to the application's window procedure. Because many applications use <strong>WM_CREATE</strong> to start the initialization process, any accessibility implementation of a UI element does not respond to the <a href="wm-getobject.html"><strong>WM_GETOBJECT</strong></a> message until after the application has finished processing the <strong>WM_CREATE</strong> message.</p>

<h1>Annotation Properties That Have Corresponding WinEvents</h1>
<p>Be careful when overriding properties that change frequently, particularly those that are examined by clients as a result of a WinEvent (such as <a href="state-property.html"><strong>State</strong></a>, <a href="value-property.html"><strong>Value</strong></a>, and, for some controls, the <a href="name-property.html"><strong>Name</strong></a> properties).</p>
<p>In many cases, especially for USER and ComCtl controls, the WinEvent signaling a property change is sent before the owner of the control is notified (typically via <a href="../controls/wm-notify.html">WM_NOTIFY</a>). Updating the property using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccpropservices-setpropvalue"><strong>SetPropValue</strong></a> in the WM_NOTIFY handler will be too late; clients using in-context hooking will already have accessed the old value.</p>
<p>You can handle these types of properties by using callback server objects (using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccpropservices-setpropserver"><strong>SetPropServer</strong></a>); however, the server cannot use any state that is updated in the WM_NOTIFY handler because that handler will not yet have been called. For example, instead of using a cached current value variable that is updated in the WM_NOTIFY handler and will be out-of-date, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccpropserver-getpropvalue"><strong>IAccPropServer::GetPropValue</strong></a> callback object should send a message directly to the control to get its true current value to generate the required property.</p>

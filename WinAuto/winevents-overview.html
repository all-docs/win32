<h1>WinEvents and Active Accessibility</h1>
<p>Microsoft Active Accessibility servers raise <em>WinEvents</em> to notify clients when an accessible object changes. There are numerous conditions in which a server notifies a client of a change. Each <a href="event-constants.html">event constant</a> defined by Microsoft Active Accessibility describes a condition about which a client is notified. For example, WinEvents can signal:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an object is created or destroyed.</li>
<li>When an object receives or loses focus.</li>
<li>When the state or location of an object changes.</li>
<li>When any property of an object changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Client applications do not receive event notifications automatically; they must specify which events they want to receive by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-setwineventhook"><strong>SetWinEventHook</strong></a> function. With <strong>SetWinEventHook</strong>, a client registers to receive one or more events and sets a hook function to handle the specified events. Clients can use the same hook function to handle multiple types of events, or it can use multipe hook functions. Clients call the <strong>SetWinEventHook</strong> once for each hook function it needs to register.</p>
<p>Hook functions are located within the client's code body, in a DLL mapped into the client's process, or in a DLL mapped into the server's process. Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages. For more information, see <a href="in-context-and-out-of-context-hook-functions.html">In-Context and Out-of-Context Hook Functions</a>.</p>
<p>To notify clients of an event occurrence, servers call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-notifywinevent"><strong>NotifyWinEvent</strong></a>. The system checks whether any client applications have set hook functions for the event and calls the appropriate hook functions as necessary.</p>
<p>When the client's hook function is called, it receives a number of parameters that describe the event and the object that generated the event. To gain access to the object that generated the event, the client hook function calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-accessibleobjectfromevent"><strong>AccessibleObjectFromEvent</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
If no clients have registered to receive WinEvents, the performance impact on a server for calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-notifywinevent"><strong>NotifyWinEvent</strong></a> is negligible.</p>
<p>Servers call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-notifywinevent"><strong>NotifyWinEvent</strong></a> for changes only in their own accessible objects; they do not call <strong>NotifyWinEvent</strong> for changes in system-provided user interface elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Event-Driven Communication</h2>
<p>Clients must register a WinEvent hook before they can receive WinEvent notifications. To avoid unnecessary callbacks and improve performance, clients are advised to register only for the events they need to receive.</p>
<p>Inside the hook procedure, the client can call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-accessibleobjectfromevent"><strong>AccessibleObjectFromEvent</strong></a> to retrieve an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible"><strong>IAccessible</strong></a> object for the element to which the event applies. With this object, the client can begin calling <strong>IAccessible</strong> methods to retrieve information or interact with the UI element.</p>

<h1>Name Property</h1>
<p>The <strong>Name</strong> property is a string used by clients to identify, find, or announce an object for the user. All objects support the <strong>Name</strong> property.</p>
<p>For example, the text on a button control is its name, while the name for a list box or edit control is the static text that immediately precedes the control in the tabbing order. Even graphic objects that do not display a name provide text when queried for the <strong>Name</strong> property.</p>
<p>The <strong>Name</strong> property is retrieved by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-get_accname"><strong>IAccessible::get_accName</strong></a>.</p>
<h2>Selecting Names</h2>
<p>An object's name should be intuitive so that users understand the object's meaning or purpose. Also, the <strong>Name</strong> property should be unique relative to any sibling objects in the parent.</p>
<p>Navigation within tables presents especially difficult problems for some users. Therefore, server developers should make table cell names as descriptive as possible. For example, you could create a cell name by combining the names of the row and column it occupies, such as &quot;A1.&quot; However, it is generally better to use more descriptive names, such as &quot;Nancy, February&quot; where &quot;Nancy&quot; is the current row and &quot;February&quot; is the current column.</p>
<h2>Delegating Requests</h2>
<p>If an object does not have access to its <strong>Name</strong> property, it delegates requests to its parent, identifying itself by its child ID. For example, if a client calls an edit control's <strong>Name</strong> property, the edit control delegates the query to its parent, which returns the value of the static text control that labels the edit control.</p>

<h1>Selection and Focus Properties and Methods</h1>
<p>Like many elements in applications running on MicrosoftÂ Windows operating systems, accessible objects <em>select</em> and receive keyboard <em>focus</em>. These attributes enable users to interact with application elements, change values, and otherwise manipulate them.</p>
<p>There are some key differences between object selection and object focus:</p>
<ul>
<li>A focused object is the one object in the entire operating system that receives keyboard input. The object with the keyboard focus is either the active window or a child object of the active window.</li>
<li>A selected object is marked to participate in some type of group operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a user can select several items in a list-view control, but the focus is given only to one object in the system at a time. Note that focused items are from a selection of items.</p>
<p>Clients determine whether a particular accessible object or child element has the focus by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-get_accfocus"><strong>IAccessible::get_accFocus</strong></a>. Clients determine whether an object is selected, or which children within an accessible object are selected, by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-get_accselection"><strong>IAccessible::get_accSelection</strong></a>. For objects such as list-view controls in which more than one child is selected, the parent object must support the <a href="/windows/win32/api/oaidl/nn-oaidl-ienumvariant">IEnumVARIANT</a> interface, which allows clients to enumerate the selected children.</p>
<h2>Events Triggered in Menus</h2>
<p>Microsoft Active Accessibility exposes standard menus created with the Microsoft Win32 menu APIs and resource files. To be consistent with standard menus, servers with custom menus trigger <a href="event-constants.html"><strong>EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS</strong></a>, not <a href="event-constants.html"><strong>EVENT_OBJECT_SELECTION</strong></a>, when a user highlights a menu item.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Microsoft Active Accessibility does not support the selection of the text contained in edit and rich edit controls because the text is exposed as a single string in the <a href="value-property.html"><strong>Value</strong></a> property for these controls.</p>

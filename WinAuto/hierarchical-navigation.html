<h1>Hierarchical Navigation</h1>
<p>Often clients must move between objects based on their parent-child relationships. For example, a client might already have information about a toolbar control, but not have information about the buttons contained within it.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible"><strong>IAccessible</strong></a> interface exposes the hierarchical relationships between objects. Clients can navigate from a parent object to its children or from a child object to its parent by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-get_accparent"><strong>IAccessible::get_accParent</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-get_accchild"><strong>IAccessible::get_accChild</strong></a>.</p>

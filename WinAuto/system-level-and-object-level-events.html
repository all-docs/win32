<h1>System-Level and Object-Level Events</h1>
<p>Microsoft Active Accessibility uses three classes of WinEvents: <em>system level</em>, <em>object level</em>, and <em>console</em>. Each has one of the following corresponding <a href="event-constants.html">event constant</a> values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event constants that begin with EVENT_SYSTEM identify system-level events. These events describe situations affecting all applications in the system.</li>
<li>Event constants that begin with EVENT_OBJECT identify object-level events. These events pertain to situations specific to objects within one application.</li>
<li>Event constants that begin with EVENT_CONSOLE identify console-level events. These events indicate changes in console windows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the system- and object-level classes of events are generated by the operating system and server applications. The operating system generates system-level and object-level events for the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>System-wide notifications about focus changes</li>
<li>Activation changes</li>
<li>Events regarding system-provided objects, such as common controls</li>
</ul>
<p>Server applications generate system-level events for custom objects that replicate system objects, such as custom menus and scroll bars.</p>
<p>Server applications typically generate object-level events for changes to the accessible objects they contain, such as object creation, destruction, and selection.</p>
<p>Although the system generates object-level events for <a href="window.html"><strong>window</strong></a> objects, servers must also send object-level events for every accessible object contained in a window. For example, if a server application registers an application-defined window class to create a custom control, the system generates object-level events for the window that contains the custom control; the server generates object-level events for the accessible object that provides information about the control.</p>
<p>Servers only generate object-level events for the custom controls for which they implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nn-oleacc-iaccessible"><strong>IAccessible</strong></a> interface. For more information, see <a href="custom-user-interface-elements.html">Custom User Interface Elements</a>.</p>

<h1>Setting Properties for Animated or Moving Objects</h1>
<p>For animation controls, such as the animation control displayed when copying files, use the <a href="object-roles.html"><strong>ROLE_SYSTEM_ANIMATION</strong></a> object role. For graphics that are occasionally animated, use the <a href="object-roles.html"><strong>ROLE_SYSTEM_GRAPHIC</strong></a> object role with the <a href="state-property.html"><strong>State</strong></a> set to <a href="object-state-constants.html"><strong>STATE_SYSTEM_ANIMATED</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="object-state-constants.html"><strong>STATE_SYSTEM_ANIMATED</strong></a> flag to mark an object whose appearance changes rapidly. Clients use this flag to avoid notifying users repeatedly for what is really a single series of visual changes.</p>
<p>An example of this is marquee text, which is disclosed progressively as it scrolls across the screen. Such objects are given the attribute of <a href="object-state-constants.html"><strong>STATE_SYSTEM_ANIMATED</strong></a>. In most cases the object's <a href="value-property.html"><strong>Value</strong></a> string reflects the entire text, even the portion not currently visible. Changing the <strong>Value</strong> string frequently to correspond to the text currently visible is not recommended because it results in far too many <a href="event-constants.html"><strong>EVENT_OBJECT_VALUECHANGE</strong></a> events that do not convey useful information.</p>
<p>For example, in a window that contains a rectangular region that shows the word &quot;Yes!&quot; moving in a figure-eight pattern, the <a href="role-property.html"><strong>Role</strong></a> is <a href="object-roles.html"><strong>ROLE_SYSTEM_GRAPHIC</strong></a>, the <a href="value-property.html"><strong>Value</strong></a> property is the string displayed, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Oleacc/nf-oleacc-iaccessible-acclocation"><strong>Location</strong></a> property is the bounding rectangle around the text, and the <a href="object-state-constants.html"><strong>STATE_SYSTEM_ANIMATED</strong></a> attribute flag is set. The <a href="description-property.html"><strong>Description</strong></a> is &quot;The word 'Yes!' is moving around the screen in a figure-eight pattern.&quot; The server generates only <a href="event-constants.html"><strong>EVENT_OBJECT_STATECHANGE</strong></a> events when the object starts or ceases animation.</p>

<h1>WinEvents</h1>
<p>The MicrosoftÂ Windows operating system includes a feature, called <em>WinEvents</em>, that enables processes and applications running on the Windows desktop to exchange certain types of information. Accessibility tools that use Microsoft UI Automation and Microsoft Active Accessibility are among the primary users of the WinEvents.</p>
<p>In the context of accessibility, UI Automation providers and Microsoft Active Accessibility servers use WinEvents to notify clients of changes in an application UI, such as when a UI element has been created or destroyed, or when an element name, state, or value has changed.</p>
<p>This section provides suggestions, guidelines, and examples to help clients handle WinEvents and to help servers determine when to trigger the appropriate WinEvent.</p>

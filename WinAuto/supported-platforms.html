<h1>Supported Platforms</h1>
<p>Microsoft Active Accessibility supports most Microsoft platforms and is included as part of the Windows operating system beginning with WindowsÂ XP. If you do not know which version of Microsoft Active Accessibility you are running, see <a href="which-version-of-active-accessibility-is-currently-installed.html">Which Version of Active Accessibility Is Currently Installed?</a></p>
<p>If you do not have the latest version of Microsoft Active Accessibility, use the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=21596">Microsoft Active Accessibility 2.0 Redistributable Kit (RDK)</a> to upgrade. This RDK contains all of the core system files needed to incorporate Microsoft Active Accessibility technology into client and server applications. It supports WindowsÂ 98, WindowsÂ NTÂ 4.0 with Service PackÂ 6 (SP6) and later, WindowsÂ 2000, WindowsÂ Millennium Edition (WindowsÂ Me), WindowsÂ XP, and Windows ServerÂ 2003.</p>
<p>To install the Microsoft Active Accessibility RDK, see the <a href="/windows/apps/accessibility">Microsoft Accessibility Developer Center on MSDN</a>.</p>
<p>The following table lists each Windows operating system and the Microsoft Active Accessibility version that supports it. Note that WindowsÂ CE and Windows 3.1 are not supported by any Microsoft Active Accessibility version.</p>

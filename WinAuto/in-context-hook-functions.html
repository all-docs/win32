<h1>In-Context Hook Functions</h1>
<p>The following list outlines the key aspects of in-context hook functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-context hooks functions must be located in a dynamic-link library (DLL) that the system maps into the server's address space.</li>
<li>In-context hook functions share the address space with the server.</li>
<li>When the server triggers an event, the system calls a hook function without marshaling (packaging and sending interface parameters across process boundaries).</li>
<li>In-context hook functions tend to be very fast and receive event notifications synchronously because there is no marshaling.</li>
<li>Some events may be delivered out-of-process, even though you request that they be delivered in-process (using the WINEVENT_INCONTEXT flag). You might see this situation with 64-bit and 32-bit application interoperability issues and with Windows console events.</li>
</ul>

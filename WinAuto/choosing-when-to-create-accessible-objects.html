<h1>Choosing When to Create Accessible Objects</h1>
<p>Server developers can create all the accessible objects within a container when the container is created, or they can create the accessible objects dynamically.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a dialog box with several custom controls. A server creates accessible objects for all of the custom controls when the dialog box is displayed. However, if one of the controls is a custom combo box, the server waits until a user selects it to create accessible objects for the items that the combo box contains.</p>
<p>By having the parent create accessible objects dynamically, applications use less memory than if all the possible accessible objects were created ahead of time.</p>

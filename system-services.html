<td><a href="./com/component-object-model--com--portal.html">COM</a></td>
<td>COM is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents) and ActiveX (Internet-enabled components) technologies.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./cossdk/component-services-portal.html">COM+</a></td>
<td>COM+ is an evolution of Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS). COM+ builds on and extends applications written using COM, MTS, and other COM-based technologies. COM+ handles many of the resource management tasks that you previously had to program yourself, such as thread allocation and security. COM+ also makes your applications more scalable by providing thread pooling, object pooling, and just-in-time object activation. COM+ also helps protect the integrity of your data by providing transaction support, even if a transaction spans multiple databases over a network.</td>

<td><a href="./activity_coordinator/-activity-coordinator-portal.html">Activity Coordinator</a></td>
<td>The Activity Coordinator API coordinates execution of deferrable tasks on a system. Deferrable tasks are those tasks which donâ€™t need to be run immediately. They can defer their execution to a time when the system is in a desired state where running the task does not interfere with other ongoing work.</td>

<td><a href="./cmpapi/-compression-portal.html">Compression API</a></td>
<td>The Compression API exposes the Windows MSZIP, XPRESS, XPRESS_HUFF, and LZMS compression algorithms. This enables developers of Windows applications to manage versions, service, and extend the exposed compression algorithms.</td>

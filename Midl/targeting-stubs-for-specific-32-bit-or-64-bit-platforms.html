<h1>Targeting Stubs for Specific 32-bit or 64-bit Platforms</h1>
<p>Some of the features of Microsoft RPC and the MIDL 3.0 and later compilers are platform-specific.</p>
<p>As a precaution, the MIDL 3.0 and later compilers generate guards that facilitate compatibility checking during the C-compilation phase. MIDL generates two types of guards: a platform-dependent guard (32-bit versus 64-bit) and a release-dependent guard (feature set dependency). For example, MIDL generates the following guard to prevent C-compiling of a 32-bit stub for other platforms:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#if !defined(__RPC_WIN32__)
#error  Invalid build platform for this stub.
#endif
</code></pre>
<p>The release-dependent guard is triggered by a set of features found in the processed IDL file(s) and by the <a href="-target.html"><strong>/target</strong></a> switch. For example, if the interface uses features supported only on WindowsÂ 2000 or later, MIDL generates a guard with the TARGET_IS_NT50_OR_LATER macro.</p>
<p>The guard macros, defined in Rpcndr.h, depend on the setting of WINVER and _WIN32_WINNT and are evaluated by the C/C++ compiler.</p>
<p>If, at C-compile time, you get an error message indicating that you need a specific platform to run a stub, first check to make sure you have not used a feature that is not available on this platform. The features triggering a particular guard are listed in the body of the guard. In the previous example, the -Oicf compiler switch triggered the guard. Notable features of this kind include the <a href="-robust.html"><strong>/robust</strong></a> switch and the [<a href="async.html"><strong>async</strong></a>] attribute available on WindowsÂ 2000 and later, the <a href="pipe.html"><strong>pipe</strong></a> type constructor, the /Oif compiler option, and the [<a href="user-marshal.html"><strong>user_marshal</strong></a>] and [<a href="wire-marshal.html"><strong>wire_marshal</strong></a>] attributes. Stubs using these features will not run on earlier systems.</p>
<p>If you know that your target platform is correct for the features you are using and still receive an error, you may need to set the environment variables appropriately.</p>

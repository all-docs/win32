<h1>The Response File Command</h1>
<p>A response file is a text file containing one or more MIDL compiler command-line options. Unlike a command line, a response file allows multiple lines of options and file names. This may be useful due to limitations of your build environment, or as a convenience for your build process.</p>
<h2>Switch Options</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>midl @response_file
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>response_file</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Specifies the name of a response file. The response file name must immediately follow the @ character. No white space is allowed between the @ character and the response file name.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>As an alternative to placing all options associated with a switch on the command line, the MIDL compiler accepts response files that contain switches and arguments. Options in a response file are interpreted as if they are present in that location in the MIDL command line.</p>
<p>Each argument in a response file must begin and end on the same line. The backslash character (\) cannot be used to concatenate lines. When it is part of a quoted string in the response file, the backslash character can only be used before another backslash or before a double quotation mark character (&quot;). When it is not part of a quoted string, the backslash character can only be used before a double quotation mark character.</p>
<p>MIDL supports command-line arguments that include one or more response files combined with other command-line switches.</p>
<p>The MIDL compiler does not support nested response files.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p><strong>midl @midl.rsp</strong></p>
<p><strong>midl -Oicf @midl1.rsp -env win32 @midl2.rsp itf.idl</strong></p>

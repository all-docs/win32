<h1>Response Files</h1>
<p>As an alternative to placing all the options on the command line, the MIDL compiler accepts response files that contain switches and arguments. A response file is a text file containing one or more MIDL compiler command-line options. Unlike a command line, a response file allows multiple lines of options and file names. This may be useful due to limitations of your build environment or as a convenience for your build process. You can specify a MIDL response file as:</p>
<p><strong>midl</strong> <strong>@filename</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>filename</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Specifies the name of the response file. The response file name must immediately follow the @ character with no white space between the @ character and the response file name.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Options in a response file are interpreted as if they were present at that place in the MIDL command line. Each argument in a response file must begin and end on the same line. You cannot use the backslash character (\) to concatenate lines.</p>
<p>MIDL supports command-line arguments that include one or more response files, combined with other command-line switches:</p>
<p><strong>midl -Oicf @midl1.rsp -envwin32 @midl2.rsp itf.idl</strong></p>
<p>The MIDL compiler does not support nested response files.</p>

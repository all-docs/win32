<h1>/cstruct_out switch</h1>
<p>This switch modifies the C definition of a COM interface which returns structures to match the ABI a C++ implementer would provide.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>midl /cstruct_out
</code></pre>
<h2>Switch Options</h2>
<p>This switch has no parameters.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Some interface definitions (notably those in <code>d3d12.idl</code>) contain <code>__stdcall</code> methods that return structures. The C and C++ ABIs from MSVC differ in how they implement such functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>C treats them as plain functions that take a hidden <code>this</code> pointer as the first parameter. The complier applies a small struct optimization that allows structs smaller than 8 bytes (or larger if all values are floating point) to be returned in registers. Only larger structures are promoted to use a hidden parameter and caller-allocated return value.</li>
<li>C++ treats them as member functions. The compiler <em>always</em> does so by inserting a hidden parameter (a pointer to a caller-allocated return value) as the second parameter, after the <code>this</code> pointer. It also returns that same pointer as its return value.</li>
</ul>
<p>This switch forces the C definition of interfaces in the resulting header to assume that the implementer was using C++, and that the C code should instead explicitly use the C++ ABI. This implies that the function includes a hidden parameter for the return value pointer and returns that pointer instead of the structure directly.</p>

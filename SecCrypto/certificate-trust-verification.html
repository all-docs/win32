<h1>Certificate Trust Verification</h1>
<p>A trust must exist between the recipient of a signed message and the signer of the message. One method of establishing this trust is through a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate</em></a>, an electronic document verifying that entities or persons are who they claim to be. A certificate is issued to an entity by a third party that is trusted by both of the other parties. So, each recipient of a signed message decides if the issuer of the signer's certificate is trustworthy. <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>CryptoAPI</em></a> has implemented a methodology to allow application developers to create applications that automatically verify certificates against a predefined list of trusted certificates or <a href="../secgloss/r-gly.html"><em>roots</em></a>. This list of trusted entities (called subjects) is called a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate trust list</em></a> (CTL).</p>
<p>The following example of using a CTL involves an intranet (intra-company network) administrator who wants to control just which outside sources are trusted. In this case, the administrator can create a list of trusted certificates or roots, sign it, and make the list available to all clients on the network in the form of a CTL. An application designed to use this CryptoAPI functionality would then only accept signed messages or downloaded software that was signed by entities on the list.</p>

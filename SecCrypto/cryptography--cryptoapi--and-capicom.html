<h1>Cryptography, CryptoAPI, and CAPICOM</h1>
<p>CryptoAPI and CAPICOM provide services that enable application developers to add encryption/decryption of data, authentication using digital <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificates</em></a>, and encoding to and decoding from <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>Abstract Syntax Notation One</em></a> (ASN.1) to their Windows-based applications. Application developers can use the functions in CryptoAPI without knowing details of the underlying implementation, in much the same way as they can use a graphics library without knowing anything about the particular graphics hardware configuration. CryptoAPI works with a number of <a href="microsoft-cryptographic-service-providers.html">Cryptographic Service Providers</a> that perform the actual cryptographic functions.</p>

<h1>Application Uses</h1>
<p>Certificate Services issues certificates that can be used in public key infrastructure (PKI) applications. For example, the certificates work in SSL, S/MIME and IPSEC applications. Possible scenarios where these certificates can be used are digital signing and message encryption. Certificate Services provides certificates, <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate revocation lists</em></a> (CRL), and CRL distribution points (CDP) that are usable by both Microsoft and non-Microsoft applications.</p>

<h1>Certificate Services</h1>
<p><a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>Certificate Services</em></a>, a service running on a Windows server operating system, receives requests for new digital certificates over transports such as RPC or HTTP. It checks each request against custom or site-specific policies, sets optional properties for a certificate to be issued, and issues the certificate. Certificate Services allows administrators to add elements to a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate revocation list</em></a> (CRL), and to publish signed CRLs on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Certificate services include programmable interfaces for creating support for additional transports, policies, and certificate properties and formats.</p>
<p>In Windows ServerÂ 2003, Certificate Services 2.0 can be installed from <strong>Control Panel</strong> by clicking <strong>Add or Remove Programs</strong> and then clicking <strong>Add/Remove Windows Components</strong> to install or uninstall Certificate Services.</p>
<p>Certificate Services concepts are detailed in the following sections. The content is intended to help you develop applications that will interact with Certificate Services.</p>

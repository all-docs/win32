<h1>Hierarchies</h1>
<p>Certificate Services supports <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certification authority</em></a> (CA) hierarchies. A <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>CA hierarchy</em></a> consists of a top-level CA (called the Root CA) with one or more subordinate CAs which have been issued certificates by the root CA. A possible CA hierarchy scenario would be in an organization with one root CA, which was used to issue certificates to several subordinate CAs. The subordinate CAs can then issue end-entity certificates, such as certificates issued to a user. The user's certificate will contain a trust path for the CA hierarchy, in this case, including the certificate for both the issuing subordinate CA as well as the root CA.</p>

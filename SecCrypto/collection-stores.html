<h1>Collection Stores</h1>
<p>As the number of <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificates</em></a>, <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate revocation lists</em></a> (CRLs), and <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate trust list</em></a> (CTLs) in a user's collection grows, the organization of those certificates becomes an issue. One possible solution is to create separate certificate stores to keep different kinds of certificates. This solution creates a new problem because an application might need to search several different stores to find a specific certificate. The use of logical or collection stores solves this problem.</p>
<p>A <a href="../secgloss/l-gly.html"><em>logical store</em></a> and a collection certificate store are groups of physical stores that appears to an application as a single store. All member stores of a logical or collection store can be searched or enumerated with a single function call to either <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certfindcertificateinstore"><strong>CertFindCertificateInStore</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certenumcertificatesinstore"><strong>CertEnumCertificatesInStore</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The use of logical or collection stores also provides flexibility that is difficult to achieve with paper records. A certificate in a single physical store might need to be a member of several different logical groups. Therefore, an individual physical store can be a member of more than one logical or collection store as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/mancert.png" alt="collection stores" /></p>
<p>This illustration presents the following basic, logical certificate store concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>A collection certificate store has a pointer to the first pointer block for that collection store.</li>
<li>Each pointer block of a collection store has a pointer to a sibling store and a pointer to the next pointer block of the collection.</li>
<li>Each sibling store in a collection is a simple physical certificate store.</li>
<li>A simple certificate store can be a member sibling store in many different collection stores.</li>
<li>Certificates added to a collection store are physically added to one of the sibling stores in the collection.</li>
<li>Certificates in a sibling store can be accessed by any collection store in which the sibling store is a member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Collection stores are built within an application by opening a collection store by using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certopenstore"><strong>CertOpenStore</strong></a> and then using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certaddstoretocollection"><strong>CertAddStoreToCollection</strong></a> to add an open sibling store to the collection store. A sibling store can be deleted from a collection store by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certremovestorefromcollection"><strong>CertRemoveStoreFromCollection</strong></a>.</p>

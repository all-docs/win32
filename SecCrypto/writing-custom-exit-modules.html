<h1>Writing Custom Exit Modules</h1>
<p>Custom exit modules must implement the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certexit/nn-certexit-icertexit"><strong>ICertExit</strong></a> interface, which is called by the server engine. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certexit/nf-certexit-icertexit-initialize"><strong>ICertExit::Initialize</strong></a> method is called by the server engine when the exit module is loaded. It allows the exit module to perform initialization and returns a value that informs the server engine of the kinds of events for which it wants notification. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certexit/nf-certexit-icertexit-getdescription"><strong>ICertExit::GetDescription</strong></a> method must return a description string when the server engine requests it. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certexit/nf-certexit-icertexit-notify"><strong>ICertExit::Notify</strong></a> method is called by the server engine to notify the exit module that an event has occurred.</p>
<p>Exit modules can call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certif/nn-certif-icertserverexit"><strong>ICertServerExit</strong></a> interface, which supports many of the same methods as the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certif/nn-certif-icertserverpolicy"><strong>ICertServerPolicy</strong></a> interface, with the exception of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certif/nf-certif-icertserverpolicy-setcertificateextension"><strong>SetCertificateExtension</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Certif/nf-certif-icertserverpolicy-setcertificateproperty"><strong>SetCertificateProperty</strong></a> methods.</p>

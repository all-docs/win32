<h1>Session Keys</h1>
<p><a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>Session keys</em></a> are keys that are generated to be used in a single communication session. Session keys are frequently changed and are discarded when they are no longer needed. Typically a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>symmetric key</em></a> is used as the session key.</p>
<p>Session keys are volatile. Applications can save these keys for later use or for transmission to other users. For more information, see <a href="cryptographic-key-storage-and-exchange.html">Cryptographic Key Storage and Exchange</a>.</p>

<h1>Checking Certificate Revocation Status</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p>CAPICOM does not enable certificate revocation checking by default. However, certificate revocation checking can be enabled programmatically for a particular certificate through the <strong>IsValid.CheckFlag</strong> property of a Certificate object. After the appropriate value of <strong>CheckFlag</strong> has been set, accessing the Certificate object's <strong>IsValid.Result</strong> property or building the certificate's verification path using a Chain object's Build method forces revocation checking.</p>
<p>In the following example, cert has been instantiated as a valid CAPICOM certificate.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Dim cert As Certificate
Dim LocalStore As New Store

' Open the My store.
LocalStore.Open LocalStore.Open CAPICOM_CURRENT_USER_STORE, _
    CAPICOM_MY_STORE, CAPICOM_STORE_OPEN_READ_WRITE

' Get the first certificate in the My store.
set cert = LocalStore.Certificates.Item(1)

cert.IsValid.CheckFlag = CAPICOM_CHECK_TRUSTED_ROOT Or _ 
   CAPICOM_CHECK_TIME_VALIDITY Or _ 
   CAPICOM_CHECK_SIGNATURE_VALIDITY Or _ 
   CAPICOM_CHECK_ONLINE_REVOCATION_STATUS
If cert.IsValid.Result Then
'CERTIFICATE IS VALID!
Else
Dim chain As New Chain
     chain.Build (cert)
     If CAPICOM_TRUST_IS_REVOKED And chain.Status Then
'AT LEAST ONE CERTIFICATE IN THE CHAIN HAS BEEN REVOKED
     End If
     If CAPICOM_TRUST_REVOCATION_STATUS_UNKNOWN And chain.Status Then
'THE REVOCATION STATUS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED
     End If
End If

</code></pre>
<p>The preceding applies to an individual certificate, no matter how it was obtained. Performing revocation checking on the certificates in a <a href="signeddata.html"><strong>SignedData</strong></a> object is no different because the <strong>SignedData</strong> object's <a href="signeddata-verify.html"><strong>Verify</strong></a> method cannot be used for this purpose because enabling CAPICOM_VERIFY_SIGNATURE_AND_CERTIFICATE does not cause CRL checking.</p>
<p>Instead, the <strong>CheckFlag</strong> must be set for each signer's certificate. Consider the following example where sData has been instantiated as a valid CAPICOM <a href="signeddata.html"><strong>SignedData</strong></a> object.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Dim cert As Certificate
Dim chain As New Chain

' sData is an existing SignedData object.

For I = 1 To sData.Certificates.Count
   set cert = sData.Certificates(I) 
   cert.IsValid.CheckFlag = _ 
       CAPICOM_CHECK_TRUSTED_ROOT Or _ 
       CAPICOM_CHECK_TIME_VALIDITY Or _ 
       CAPICOM_CHECK_SIGNATURE_VALIDITY Or _ 
       CAPICOM_CHECK_ONLINE_REVOCATION_STATUS
   If cert.IsValid.Result Then
      'THE CERTIFICATE IS VALID!
   Else
      chain.Build cert
      If CAPICOM_TRUST_IS_REVOKED And chain.Status Then
         'AT LEAST ONE CERTIFICATE IN THE CHAIN HAS BEEN REVOKED
      End If
      If CAPICOM_TRUST_REVOCATION_STATUS_UNKNOWN And chain.Status Then
         'THE REVOCATION STATUS COULD NOT BE DETERMINED
      End If
   End If
Next I
</code></pre>
<p>The additional example is the loop over all the certificates in the <a href="signeddata.html"><strong>SignedData</strong></a> object.</p>

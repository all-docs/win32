<h1>Receiving an Enveloped Data Message</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p>To decrypt an enveloped message, the recipient matches a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate</em></a> from the My store that has an available private key with a certificate in the enveloped message. If a match is found, the encrypted key associated with that certificate is decrypted and that decrypted key is used to decrypt the enveloped message. A message recipient that does not have a matching certificate with an available private key cannot decrypt the message.</p>
<p>In the example that follows, a file name is passed into the subroutine, that file is opened and an enveloped message is read in. The enveloped message is then decrypted. The steps of matching a user certificate with a certificate in the enveloped message, of decrypting the encryption key, and finally of decrypting the message are all done behind the scenes. An error is raised if a certificate match is not found or if the decryption fails.</p>
<p>On any CAPICOM error, a negative decimal value of <strong>Err.Number</strong> is returned. For more information, see <a href="capicom-error-code.html"><strong>CAPICOM_ERROR_CODE</strong></a>. For information about positive decimal values of <strong>Err.Number</strong>, see Winerror.h.</p>

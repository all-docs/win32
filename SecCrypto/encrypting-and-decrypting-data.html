<h1>Encrypting and Decrypting Data</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p>When a document or text needs to have privacy protected by a single user or when the document is to be shared among a small group of people who all have access to the same secret password, simple encryption/decryption can be done. CAPICOM does not support the PKCS #7 EncryptedData content type but uses a non-standard ASN structure for EncryptedData. Therefore, only CAPICOM can decrypt a CAPICOM EncryptedData object.</p>
<p>The following sections show examples for encryption and decryption tasks:</p>

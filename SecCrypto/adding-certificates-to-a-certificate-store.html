<h1>Adding Certificates to a Certificate Store</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p><a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>Certificates</em></a> can be added to or removed from <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate stores</em></a> if the store is opened with read/write permission. Read/write permission is not granted to Active Directory stores. While certificates can be added to or removed from memory stores, changes in memory stores are not persisted between sessions.</p>
<p>Certificates can be added to a certificate store that is opened with read/write permission by using the <strong>Add</strong> method. A certificate can be removed from a certificate store that is opened with read/write permission by using the <strong>Remove</strong> method. New stores can be created and saved in the CAPICOM_CURRENT_USER_STORE and CAPICOM_LOCAL_MACHINE_STORE locations. Newly created stores in either of these locations can be opened with read/write permission.</p>
<p>In the following example, two certificate stores are opened. Certificates of subjects with last names beginning with F are retrieved from the Active Directory store. The CAPICOM_CURRENT_USER_STORE, CAPICOM_CA_STORE store is then opened as a read/write store and the first certificate from the collection of certificates in the Active Directory store is added to the certificates in the CAPICOM_CA_STORE.</p>
<p>For demonstration purposes, the example shows the opening of stores in the CAPICOM_MEMORY_STORE, CAPICOM_CURRENT_USER_STORE, and CAPICOM_LOCAL_MACHINE_STORE locations. The example shows exporting all certificates from an open store, writing the exported certificates to a file, reading them back in, and importing them into a different store. The newly imported certificates are them enumerated and displayed.</p>
<p>On any CAPICOM error, a negative decimal value of <strong>Err.Number</strong> is returned. For more information, see <a href="capicom-error-code.html"><strong>CAPICOM_ERROR_CODE</strong></a>. For information about positive decimal values of <strong>Err.Number</strong>, see Winerror.h.</p>
<p>The following example shows opening certificate stores using early binding in the declaration of the <strong>Store</strong> objects and in creating an instance of those objects.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Sub AddCert()
On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
' The following shows two different ways to declare and
' create a store object.

Dim myADstore As New Store

Dim myCAstore As Store
Set myCAstore = New Store

' In this example, the Active Directory store will be searched for a 
' certificate with a subject name that begins with the letter F. 
' This is done by using the string &quot;SN=F*&quot; as the name of the store.

Dim SubjectNameSN As String
SubjectNameSN = &quot;SN=F*&quot;

' Active Directory stores can only be opened with read-only
' access.

myADstore.Open CAPICOM_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_USER_STORE,
                SubjectNameSN , CAPICOM_STORE_OPEN_READ_ONLY

'  This example assumes that the store opened and that
'  at least one certificate was returned.
'  A complete application would ensure that at least one certificate
'  was in the store before proceeding and would
'  also select one or more of the certificates returned
'  to be added instead of using the first certificate
'  in the collection.

'  Open the MY store so that a certificate can be added.

myCAstore.Open CAPICOM_CURRENT_USER_STORE, CAPICOM_MY_STORE,
                    CAPICOM_STORE_OPEN_READ_WRITE

myCAstore.Add myADstore.certificates.Item(1)

' Release the two store objects.

Set myCAstore = Nothing
Set myADstore = Nothing
Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:
If Err.Number &gt; 0 Then
    MsgBox &quot;Visual Basic error found:&quot; &amp; Err.Description
Else
    MsgBox &quot;CAPICOM error found : &quot; &amp; Err.Number
End If

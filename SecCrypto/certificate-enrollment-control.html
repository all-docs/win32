<h1>Certificate Enrollment Control</h1>
<p>Certificate Enrollment Control can be used by an application that must request that a certificate be issued to a named subject. It is designed to accept data in the form of a binary string (BSTR). The data can come from a webpage or from the user interface of the Visual Basic or Visual C++ development system. The output from the Certificate Enrollment Control is a PKCS #10 certificate request that can be sent on to a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certification authority</em></a> (CA).</p>
<p><img src="images/xen-arch.png" alt="certificate enrollment control" /></p>
<p>Necessary information about the user, the certificate subject, is collected by the User Interface. This information is provided as a BSTR input to the Certificate Enrollment Control. The Certificate Enrollment Control generates the appropriate signature key, key exchange key, or both key pairs. The control then generates and signs a PKCS #10 <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate request</em></a> by using the generated <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>private key</em></a>. The Certificate Enrollment Control then links the key pair to a temporary dummy certificate which is stored in the request store until the issued certificate is returned from a certification authority. Finally, the application sends the PKCS #10 certificate request to a CA.</p>
<p>If the CA approves the certificate request, the CA creates a certificate containing the public key. The CA also signs and returns the certificate.</p>
<p>When the requested certificate is returned from the CA, the application passes the PKCS #7 message back to the Certificate Enrollment Control where the certificate or chain of certificates is extracted from the PKCS #7 message. The certificate and any other certificates in the chain of trust are stored in a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate store</em></a>. The returned certificate is not modified in any way. Any certificate-aware application can now access this certificate from the store.</p>
<p>Smart Card Enrollment Control is used by an administrator to enroll on behalf of smart card users. The enrollment process results in a certificate being issued that is stored on a user's smart card.</p>
<p>The Smart Card Enrollment Control is contained in Scrdenrl.dll and consists of one object, <strong>SCrdEnr</strong>. No other objects are included in Scrdenrl.dll. This Smart Card Enrollment object can be used with a script language, such as Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript).</p>
<p>A <a href="../secgloss/r-gly.html"><em>smart card reader</em></a> must be installed on the computer running the Smart Card Enrollment Control.</p>
<p>Additionally, the smart card issuer must have obtained a signing certificate based on the &quot;EnrollmentAgent&quot; certificate template. This signing certificate will be used to sign the certificate request generated on behalf of the smart card recipient. By default, domain administrators are granted permission to request a certificate based on the &quot;Enrollment Agent&quot; template. Another user can be granted permission to enroll for an &quot;EnrollmentAgent&quot; certificate (by means of the Active Directory Sites and Services MMC snap-in); doing so, however, allows this user to self-issue a smart card with domain administrator privileges.</p>

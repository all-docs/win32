<h1>Decoding a CERT_INFO Structure</h1>
<p>Given a certificate, the first step in decoding the certificate <a href="../secgloss/b-gly.html"><em>BLOB</em></a> is to call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certcreatecertificatecontext"><strong>CertCreateCertificateContext</strong></a>, passing it a pointer to the encoded certificate (<em>BLOB</em>). When this function is called, it creates a duplicate of the encoded certificate, creates a structure of type <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_context"><strong>CERT_CONTEXT</strong></a>, and creates a structure of type <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_info"><strong>CERT_INFO</strong></a>. As shown in the following illustration, a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate context</em></a> includes the original certificate <em>BLOB</em>, a C structure of type <strong>CERT_CONTEXT</strong>, and a C structure of type <strong>CERT_INFO</strong>. One of the members of the <strong>CERT_CONTEXT</strong> structure points to the <strong>CERT_INFO</strong> structure and another to the encoded certificate BLOB.</p>

<p>The encoded object (data member) is always provided as the input to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecodeobject"><strong>CryptDecodeObject</strong></a> function, and the output is a C structure that may or may not have encoded members, depending on how far into the process you are.</p>
<p>There is one other member that requires some decoding, and that is the <strong>Extension</strong> member. Although it is not encoded at the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_info"><strong>CERT_INFO</strong></a> level, it does contain some encoded information. To decode this information, proceed as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/xtension.png" alt="decoding information" /></p>
<p>In the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_info"><strong>CERT_INFO</strong></a> structure, member <strong>rgExtension</strong> is a pointer to an array of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_extension"><strong>CERT_EXTENSION</strong></a> structures. Each <strong>CERT_EXTENSION</strong> structure has a <strong>Value</strong> member that is in encoded form and needs to be decoded. The <strong>Value</strong> member is passed to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecodeobject"><strong>CryptDecodeObject</strong></a> function, and then the output from the function depends on the value of the <strong>pszObjId</strong> member. Notice that in the illustration, two different structures are produced, one of type <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_basic_constraints_info"><strong>CERT_BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_INFO</strong></a> and one of type <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_authority_key_id_info"><strong>CERT_AUTHORITY_KEY_ID_INFO</strong></a>, depending on the value of <strong>pszObjId</strong>.</p>

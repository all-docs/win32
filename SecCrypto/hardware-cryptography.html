<h1>Hardware Cryptography</h1>
<p>Certificate Services supports hardware-related cryptography, such as issuing certificates stored on <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart cards</em></a>. The enterprise <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certification authority</em></a> (CA) supports the issuance of smart card certificates for domain logon on the operating system. Additionally, both the enterprise CA and stand-alone CA support issuance of other types of smart card certificates.</p>
<p>For details, see the product documentation. For developer information about smart cards, see <a href="../secauthn/smart-card-authentication.html">Smart Card Authentication</a>. For information about the control that allows an administrator to request smart card certificates on behalf of users, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secsmart/smart-card-enrollment-control-usage-scenario">Smart Card Enrollment Control</a>.</p>

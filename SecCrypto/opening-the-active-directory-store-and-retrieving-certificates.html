<h1>Opening the Active Directory Store and Retrieving Certificates</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p><a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>Certificates</em></a> can be retrieved from an Active Directory store where the certificates of users of a domain are stored. An Active Directory store can only be opened in the read-only mode and applications cannot added certificates to or remove certificates from an Active Directory store using CAPICOM.</p>
<p>On any CAPICOM error, a negative decimal value of <strong>Err.Number</strong> is returned. For more information, see <a href="capicom-error-code.html"><strong>CAPICOM_ERROR_CODE</strong></a>. For information about positive decimal values of <strong>Err.Number</strong>, see Winerror.h.</p>
<p>The following example shows opening an Active Directory store and retrieving certificates from that store.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Sub OpenADStore()
        On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
        Dim mystore As Store
        Set mystore = New Store
        
        ' Put a string that represents the name of a certificate 
        ' subject in SubjectNameCn. In the following example, 
        ' the * wildcard character is used in the string so that
        ' the Active Directory store will be searched for all 
        ' certificates with a subject name beginning with 'S.'
       
        Dim SubjectNameCn As String
        ' The following uses 'cn=' and the * wildcard character.
        ' Using this string, all certificates in the Active Directory
        ' store with a subject name beginning with an 'S' would
        ' be returned.

        SubjectNameCn = &quot;CN=S*&quot;
        
        ' Active Directory stores can only be opened with read-only
        ' access.
        
         mystore.Open CAPICOM_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY_USER_STORE, _
              SubjectNameCn, CAPICOM_STORE_OPEN_READ_ONLY
        
        If mystore.Certificates.Count &lt; 1 Then
               MsgBox &quot;A certificate for &quot; &amp; SubjectNameCn &amp; _
                      &quot; was not found &quot;
        Else

        Exit Sub

ErrorHandler:

<h1>Processing Certificate Requests</h1>
<p>Certificate Services performs the following steps when processing a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate request</em></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Request reception.</p>
<p>The <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate request</em></a> is sent by the client to an intermediary application, which formats it into a PKCS #10 format request and submits it to the server engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request approval.</p>
<p>The server engine calls the <a href="policy-modules.html">Policy Module</a>, which queries request properties, decides whether the request is authorized or not, and sets optional certificate properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificate formation.</p>
<p>If the request is approved, the server engine takes the request, and any properties requested by the Policy Module, and builds a complete certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificate publication.</p>
<p>The server engine stores the completed certificate in the Certificate Services database and notifies the intermediary application of the request status. If the <a href="exit-modules.html">exit module</a> has so requested, the server engine will notify it of a certificate issuance event. This allows the exit module to perform further operations such as publishing the certificate to an external certificate repository (for example, a directory service). Meanwhile, the intermediary gets the published certificate from Certificate Services and passes it back to the client.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following illustration shows how a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate request</em></a> is processed by Certificate Services.</p>

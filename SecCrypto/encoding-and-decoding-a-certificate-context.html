<h1>Encoding and Decoding a Certificate Context</h1>
<p><a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>CryptoAPI</em></a> supports the encoding and decoding of <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificates</em></a>. CryptoAPI includes an extensive, flexible system of functions and C structures that allow encoding and decoding in various ways. CryptoAPI supports standard <a href="../secgloss/x-gly.html"><em>X.509</em></a> certificate structure and standard <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>Abstract Syntax Notation One</em></a> (ASN.1) encoding to provide interoperability with other systems.</p>
<p>For an overview of encoded data, see <a href="encoded-and-decoded-data.html">Encoded and Decoded Data</a>.</p>
<h2>Certificate Contexts</h2>
<p>A <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate context</em></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_context"><strong>CERT_CONTEXT</strong></a>, is a C structure that contains an encoded member, a handle to a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate store</em></a>, a pointer to the original encoded <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate BLOB</em></a>, and a pointer to a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_info"><strong>CERT_INFO</strong></a> C structure.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_info"><strong>CERT_INFO</strong></a> structure is the heart of the certificate. It contains, in direct form and in encoded form, all the basic information in the certificate. The following illustration shows the <strong>CERT_INFO</strong> structure with all of its encoded members shown as shaded.</p>
<p><img src="images/certinf2.png" alt="cert-info structure" /></p>
<p>The <strong>IssuerUniqueID</strong> and <strong>SubjectUniqueID</strong> members are part of the <a href="../secgloss/x-gly.html"><em>X.509</em></a> version 2 certificate implementation but are seldom used. Certificate extensions in version 3 replace the functionality of these members.</p>
<p>If the information contained in the encoded (shaded) members <strong>Issuer</strong> and <strong>Subject</strong> is needed, those members must be decoded. Use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecodeobject"><strong>CryptDecodeObject</strong></a> to decode these members. The following illustration shows the process of decoding one of these members.</p>
<p><img src="images/infoflow.png" alt="decoding with cryptdecodeobject" /></p>
<p>In the illustrated case, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdecodeobject"><strong>CryptDecodeObject</strong></a> function creates a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_name_info"><strong>CERT_NAME_INFO</strong></a> structure, an array of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_rdn"><strong>CERT_RDN</strong></a> structures, a corresponding array of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_rdn_attr"><strong>CERT_RDN_ATTR</strong></a> structures, and a string that contains the name. Members of the <strong>CERT_RDN_ATTR</strong> structure determine the contents of the string. For example, if the <strong>pszObjId</strong> member is 2.5.4.3, the string contains a common name. If it is 2.5.4.10, the string would contain an organization name. For a list of these <a href="../secgloss/o-gly.html"><em>object identifiers</em></a> (OIDs), see <strong>CERT_RDN_ATTR</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>dwValueType</strong> member contains information about the type of string. If it is CERT_RDN_PRINTABLE_STRING, the value member contains a byte-width, zero-terminated character string. If it is CERT_RDN_UNICODE_STRING, the string is a double-width (word-sized) character string.</p>

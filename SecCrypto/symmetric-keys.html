<h1>Symmetric Keys</h1>
<p>A <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>Symmetric key</em></a> is a single key that is used with the operations of a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>symmetric encryption</em></a> scheme. For example, such a key may be used in a symmetric encryption algorithm for both encryption and decryption.</p>
<p>The best-known symmetric algorithms are faster than the best-known <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>public key algorithms</em></a>. Thus, they are preferred when processing large amounts of data. Some of the more common symmetric algorithms are <a href="../secgloss/r-gly.html"><em>RC4</em></a>, Triple DES (<a href="../secgloss/d-gly.html"><em>Data Encryption Standard</em></a>), and <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>Advanced Encryption Standard</em></a> (AES).</p>
<p>Because much of the activity involving symmetric keys relates to keeping them secret, it is important to keep the number of people who possess a particular symmetric key as small as possible. We recommend that only one or two people possess any one symmetric key.</p>

<h1>Verifying the Signature on a Document</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p>When a signed document is received, the validity of the signature or signatures can be checked. A signature can be checked for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validity of the signature hash</li>
<li>Validity of the signer's certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>The signature <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> is decrypted using the <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>public key</em></a> of the signer found on the signer's <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate</em></a>, included as part of the signature. If the decrypted signature matches a new hash of the original document, the signature was created by the owner of the private key associated with the public key used to decrypt the hash. In addition, the document that the signature is based on is guaranteed not to have been changed after the signature was created.</p>
<p>The certificate that provided the public key and the identity of the signer can also be checked for validity including such issues as whether the certificate has been revoked, whether the certificate is out of date, or whether the certificate was issued by a trusted certificate issuer.</p>
<p>In the following example, the content signed and the <strong>SignedData</strong> object are read in from a file and the signature and the validity of the certificate used to create the signature are checked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If the signature is not cryptographically valid or the certificate of the signer is not valid, an exception is raised and the verifying program must handle the exception. On any CAPICOM error, a negative decimal value of <strong>Err.Number</strong> is returned. For more information, see <a href="capicom-error-code.html"><strong>CAPICOM_ERROR_CODE</strong></a>. For information about positive decimal values of <strong>Err.Number</strong>, see Winerror.h.</p>

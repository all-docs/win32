<h1>Adding Time Stamps to Previously Signed Files</h1>
<p>Time stamps are normally included when a file is signed using SignTool with the <code>-t</code> option. In addition, time stamps can be added to files that were signed without a time stamp. The following command adds a time stamp to a previously signed file:</p>
<pre lang="console"><code>signtool timestamp -t https://timestamp.digicert.com MyControl.exe
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The file to be time stamped must have previously been signed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>For more information about SignTool, see <a href="signtool.html">SignTool</a>.</p>

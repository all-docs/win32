title: Decrypting a Message in CAPICOM
ms.topic: article
ms.date: 05/31/2018</h2>
<h1>Decrypting a Message in CAPICOM</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p>This subroutine take a password string to be used to generate a session encryption key, and the name of a file from which an encrypted message will be read. All parameters are passed into the subroutine by values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
CAPICOM does not support the PKCS #7 EncryptedData content type but uses a nonstandard ASN structure for EncryptedData. Therefore, only CAPICOM can decrypt a CAPICOM EncryptedData object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>If decryption fails, the <strong>Err.Number</strong> value is checked to determine whether the error was caused by the use of a password that did not match the password used to encrypt the message. In this case, the NTE_BAD_DATA error is returned.</p>
<p>On any CAPICOM error, a negative decimal value of <strong>Err.Number</strong> is returned. For more information, see <a href="capicom-error-code.html"><strong>CAPICOM_ERROR_CODE</strong></a>. For information about positive decimal values of <strong>Err.Number</strong>, see Winerror.h.</p>

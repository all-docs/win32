<p>[!IMPORTANT]
This API is deprecated. New and existing software should start using <a href="/windows/desktop/SecCNG/cng-portal">Cryptography Next Generation APIs.</a> Microsoft may remove this API in future releases.</p>

<p>A <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>cryptographic service provider</em></a> (CSP) contains implementations of cryptographic standards and algorithms. At a minimum, a CSP consists of a <a href="../secgloss/d-gly.html"><em>dynamic-link library</em></a> (DLL) that implements the functions in <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>CryptoSPI</em></a> (a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>system program interface</em></a>). Most CSPs contain the implementation of all of their own functions. Some CSPs, however, implement their functions mainly in a Windows-based service program managed by the Windows service control manager. Others implement functions in hardware, such as a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card</em></a> or secure coprocessor. If a CSP does not implement its own functions, the DLL acts as a pass-through layer, facilitating the communication between the operating system and the actual CSP implementation.</p>

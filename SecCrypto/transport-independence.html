<h1>Transport Independence</h1>
<p>Certificates can be requested and distributed through any transport mechanism. Certificate Services accepts <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate requests</em></a> from an applicant through HTTP, DCOM, RPC, disk file, or by custom transport. Certificate Services posts certificates to the applicant through HTTP, DCOM, RPC, disk file, or custom transport.</p>
<p>Transports are supported by intermediary applications and exit module DLLs, usually written in C/C++. The intermediary applications and exit modules isolate Certificate Services functions from communicating with any specific transport.</p>

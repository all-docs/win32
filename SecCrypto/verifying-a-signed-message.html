<h1>Verifying a Signed Message</h1>
<p>These steps verify the signature of signed data. The following illustration depicts the individual tasks that must be accomplished, as shown in the list that follows it.</p>
<p><img src="images/verifmsg.png" alt="verifying a signed message" /></p>
<p><strong>To verify the signature of a signed message</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get a pointer to the signed message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate store</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the signer ID contained in the message, get the sender's certificate and get a handle to its <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>public key</em></a>.</p>
<p>As an alternative to steps 2 and 3, you can use the certificate contained in the message to retrieve the signer's public key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the signer's public key, decrypt the digital signature, producing the original digest of the data in the message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the hash algorithm contained in the message, <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> the data contained in the message, yielding a new digest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the digest retrieved from the message with the new digest just created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the two digests match, the signature is verified. This means that the <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>private key</em></a> that was used to sign the data matches the public key just used to decrypt the signature, and that the data has not changed since the data was signed.</p>
<p>If the two digests do not match, the signature is not verified, and either the private/public keys do not match, or the data has been changed since the data was signed, or both.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A single function, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptverifymessagesignature"><strong>CryptVerifyMessageSignature</strong></a>, can be used to verify a signature, as shown in the following procedure.</p>
<p><strong>To verify a signed message</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Get a pointer to the signed message.</li>
<li>Get the size of the signed message.</li>
<li>Get a handle on a cryptographic provider.</li>
<li>Initialize the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-crypt_verify_message_para"><strong>CRYPT_VERIFY_MESSAGE_PARA</strong></a> structure.</li>
<li>Call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptverifymessagesignature"><strong>CryptVerifyMessageSignature</strong></a> to verify the signature.</li>
</ol>
<p>Code that implements this procedure is included in <a href="example-c-program-signing-a-message-and-verifying-a-message-signature.html">Example C Program: Signing a Message and Verifying a Message Signature</a>.</p>

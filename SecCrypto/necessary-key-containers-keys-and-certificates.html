<h1>Necessary Key Containers, Keys, and Certificates</h1>
<p>Example programs in the following sections perform operations that require <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>public/private key pairs</em></a> to be available for encrypting and decrypting files, messages, and signatures. Many of these programs will compile, link, and run but fail at run time without the existence of proper <a href="../secgloss/k-gly.html"><em>key containers</em></a>, keys, <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate stores</em></a>, and certificates in those stores.</p>
<p>In addition, some of the certificates in the MY store must have some of their extended properties set.</p>
<p>Creating the needed default key container can be done by running the program in <a href="example-c-program-creating-a-key-container-and-generating-keys.html">Example C Program: Creating a Key Container and Generating Keys</a>. Note that the creation of a key container does not automatically generate public/private key pairs. The example program, however, both creates the key container and generates the public/private key pairs.</p>
<p>After public/private key pairs have been generated, test certificates using those keys can be obtained from a <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certification authority</em></a> (CA).</p>
<p>Several of the programs assume that certificates with specific subject names exist in the MY system store. In particular, several programs look for certificates with the subject names &quot;Full Test Cert&quot; and &quot;Hortense.&quot; The subject names for the certificates may be changed in the code to match the subject names of certificates that exist in the MY certificate store.</p>
<p>Running the example program in <a href="example-c-program-listing-the-certificates-in-a-store.html">Example C Program: Listing the Certificates in a Store</a> will display all of the certificates in a store and all of the extended properties that are set on those certificates.</p>

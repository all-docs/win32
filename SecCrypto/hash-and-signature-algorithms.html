<h1>Hash and Signature Algorithms</h1>
<p>The following algorithms compute <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hashes</em></a> and <a href="../secgloss/d-gly.html"><em>digital signatures</em></a>. Each of these algorithms is supported in the Microsoft Base, Strong, and Enhanced Cryptographic Providers. Internal details of these algorithms are beyond the scope of this documentation. For a list of additional sources, refer to <a href="additional-documentation-on-cryptography.html">Additional Documentation on Cryptography</a>.</p>

<tr>
<td>Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) MAC<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>One of the algorithms (CALG_MAC) implemented by Microsoft providers is a <a href="../secgloss/b-gly.html"><em>block cipher</em></a> <a href="../secgloss/m-gly.html"><em>Message Authentication Code</em></a> (MAC). This method encrypts the base data with a block cipher and then uses the last encrypted block as the <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> value. The encryption algorithm used to build the MAC is the one that was specified when the session key was created. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>HMAC<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>An algorithm (CALG_HMAC) implemented by Microsoft providers. This algorithm also uses a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>symmetric key</em></a> to create the <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a>, but is more complex than the simple <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>Cipher Block Chaining</em></a> (CBC) MAC algorithm. It can be used with any iterated cryptographic hash algorithm, such as MD5 or SHA-1. For details, see <a href="creating-an-hmac.html">Creating an HMAC</a>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MD2, MD4, and MD5<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>These hashing algorithms were all developed by RSA Data Security, Inc. These algorithms were developed in sequential order. All three generate 128-bit hash values. All three are known to have weaknesses and should only be used where needed for compatibility purposes. For new code, we recommend the SHA-2 family of hashes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> These algorithms are well known and can be reviewed in detail in any reference on <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>cryptography</em></a>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Message Authentication Code (MAC)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>MAC algorithms are similar to <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> algorithms, but are computed by using a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>symmetric</em></a> (session) key. The original <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>session key</em></a> is required to recompute the hash value. The recomputed hash value is used to verify that the base data was not changed. These algorithms are sometimes called keyed-hash algorithms. To see which Microsoft providers support MAC, see <a href="microsoft-cryptographic-service-providers.html">Microsoft Cryptographic Service Providers</a>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>This hashing algorithm was developed by the <a href="../secgloss/n-gly.html"><em>National Institute of Standards and Technology</em></a> (NIST) and by the National Security Agency (NSA). This algorithm was developed for use with DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) or DSS (Digital Signature Standard). This algorithm generates a 160-bit <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> value. SHA-1 is known to have weaknesses, and should only be used where required for compatibility purposes. For new code, we recommend the SHA-2 family of hashes.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Secure Hash Algorithm - 2 (SHA-2)<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>This hashing algorithm was developed as a successor to SHA-1 by the <a href="../secgloss/n-gly.html"><em>National Institute of Standards and Technology</em></a> (NIST) and the National Security Agency (NSA). It has four variantsâ€”SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512â€”which are named according to the number of bits in their outputs. Of these, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 are implemented in the Microsoft AES Cryptographic Provider.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SSL3 Client Authorization Algorithm<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>This algorithm is used for SSL3 client authentication. In the SSL3 protocol, a concatenation of an MD5 hash and a SHA hash is signed with an RSA <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>private key</em></a>. CryptoAPI 2.0 and the Microsoft Base and Enhanced Cryptographic Providers support this with the <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> type CALG_SSL3_SHAMD5. For more information, see <a href="creating-a-calg-ssl3-shamd5-hash.html">Creating a CALG_SSL3_SHAMD5 Hash</a>.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

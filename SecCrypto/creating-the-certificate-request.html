<h1>Creating the Certificate Request</h1>
<p>The process of creating a certificate request involves collecting certain information from the requester. Usually, this is done through some sort of user interface (UI), although the information could be taken directly from a database without the need for a UI. The level of information required is set by the policy of the <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certification authority</em></a> (CA).</p>
<p>An example of the required information might be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Name</li>
<li>Unit Name</li>
<li>Company Name</li>
<li>City</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>Country/Region</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The interface is designed to make a single request for each xenroll instance. A separate xenroll instance must be created to create each <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate request</em></a>.</p>

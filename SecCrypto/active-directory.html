<h1>Active Directory</h1>
<p>Certificate Services supports the use of Active Directory. In the case of the enterprise <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certification authority</em></a> (CA), Certificate Services requires the use of the Active Directory. The enterprise CA publishes user certificates and <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificate revocation lists</em></a> (CRL) to the Active Directory. A stand-alone CA can be administered to perform the same actions provided the Active Directory is available to the stand-alone CA and a custom policy module is used.</p>

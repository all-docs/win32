<h1>Collecting and Verifying Certificates</h1>
<p>[CAPICOM is a 32-bit only component that is available for use in the following operating systems: Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, and WindowsÂ XP. Instead, use the .NET Framework to implement security features. For more information, see <a href="alternatives-to-using-capicom.html">Alternatives to Using CAPICOM</a>.]</p>
<p>Often a group of <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>certificates</em></a> needs to be collected and verified. This would often be done to prepare a group of recipients for an enveloped message. In the example that follows, the certificates in a local store are enumerated and checked for validity. Next, an Active Directory store is opened to retrieve and add to the local store new certificates. The certificates retrieved from the active directory store are checked for validity and, if valid, are added to the local store. Both stores are then closed.</p>
<p>On any CAPICOM error, a negative decimal value of <strong>Err.Number</strong> is returned. For more information, see <a href="capicom-error-code.html"><strong>CAPICOM_ERROR_CODE</strong></a>. For information about positive decimal values of <strong>Err.Number</strong>, see Winerror.h.</p>
<p>In this example, the name of the local store is passed in as a string parameter. A string indicating the search criteria for certificates in the Active Directory store is also passed in as a parameter.</p>

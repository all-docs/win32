<h1>How secure is my RPC server now?</h1>
<p>Following the security outlined in this section, and provided elsewhere in the RPC SDK, and generally accepted as proper security practices, will result in a server that has increased security. Such servers are compararively more protected from penetration attacks and privacy breaches.</p>
<p>If state is kept between RPC calls, then make sure that a single client doesn't cause the allocation of excessive resources. Allocating excessive resources could potentially deny service to other clients.</p>

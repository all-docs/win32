<h1>Server Context Run-down Routine</h1>
<p>If communication breaks down while the server is maintaining context on behalf of the client, a cleanup routine may be needed to clean up the state maintained by the server on behalf of a given client. This cleanup routine is called a <em>context run-down routine</em>. When a connection breaks, the server stub and the run-time library will call this routine on every context handle opened by the client.</p>
<p>The context run-down routine is required, and is implicitly declared and named, when you apply the [<strong>context_handle</strong>] attribute to a type definition. The server will not call the context run-down routine if the [<strong>context_handle</strong>] attribute was applied directly to a parameter.</p>
<p>The context run-down routine syntax is:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>void __RPC_USER type-id_rundown (type-id);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the type name determines the name of the context run-down routine.</p>
<p>The code fragment that follows presents a sample context run-down routine. that calls the RemoteClose procedure used in the example in <a href="interface-development-using-context-handles.html">Interface Development Using Context Handles</a>, <a href="server-development-using-context-handles.html">Server Development Using Context Handles</a>, and <a href="client-development-using-context-handles.html">Client Development Using Context Handles</a>. This procedure closes the file handle, frees the memory associated with the file, and assigns <strong>NULL</strong> to the context handle. Assigning <strong>NULL</strong> is a result of calling the RemoteClose function, and is not necessary in a run-down scenario. The RPC run time cleans up its state regardless of whether the context handle is set to <strong>NULL</strong>.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>//file: cxhndp.c (fragment of file containing remote procedures)
//The rundown routine is associated with the context handle type.  
void __RPC_USER PCONTEXT_HANDLE_TYPE_rundown(
    PCONTEXT_HANDLE_TYPE phContext)
{
    printf(&quot;Client died with an open file, closing it..\n&quot;);
    RemoteClose(&amp;phContext);
    assert(phContext == 0);
}
</code></pre>

<h1>RPC Security Essentials</h1>
<p>To complete any remote procedure call, all distributed applications must create a binding between the client and the server. For more information on bindings, see <a href="binding-and-handles.html">Binding and Handles</a>. To complete a secure remote procedure call, additional steps are necessary. First, the server must choose a security provider (authentication service in DCE terminology). Then it must decide on its authentication mechanism. After that, the client obtains a binding to the server, and requests a secure remote procedure call from the RPC run time, and specifies various security options, such as security provider, security QOS options, and so on.</p>
<p>This section explains the essential concepts and information required to use the RPC functions to create a client and server for an authenticated distributed application. It is organized into the following topics:</p>

<h1>Type Attributes</h1>
<p>Type attributes are the MIDL attributes that can be applied to type declarations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/handle"><strong>handle</strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/context-handle"><strong>context_handle</strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
<li><strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/switch-type"><strong>switch_type</strong></a><strong>]</strong></li>
<li><a href="three-pointer-types.html">pointer type attributes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>[switch_type]</strong> attribute designates the type of a union discriminator. This attribute applies only to a nonencapsulated union.</p>
<p>A context handle is a pointer with a <strong>[context_handle]</strong> attribute. The <strong>[context_handle]</strong> attribute allows you to write procedures that maintain state information between remote procedure calls. A context handle with a non-null value represents saved context and serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the client side, it contains the information needed by the RPC run-time library to direct the call to the server.</li>
<li>On the server side, it serves as a handle on active context.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/handle"><strong>handle</strong></a><strong>]</strong> attribute specifies that a type can occur as a user-defined (generic) handle. This feature permits the design of handles that are meaningful to the application. The user must provide binding and unbinding routines to convert between the user-defined handle type and the RPC primitive handle type, <strong>handle_t</strong>. A primitive handle contains destination information meaningful to the RPC run-time libraries. A user-defined handle can only be defined in a type declaration, not in a function declaration. A parameter with the <strong>[handle]</strong> attribute has a double purpose. It is used to determine the binding for the call, and it is transmitted to the called procedure as a normal data parameter.</p>

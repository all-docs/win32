<h1>Function Return Values</h1>
<p>Function return values are similar to <strong>[out]</strong>-only parameters because their data is not provided by the client application. However they are managed differently. Unlike <strong>[out]</strong>-only parameters, they are not required to be pointers. The remote procedure can return any valid data type except reference pointers and nonencapsulated unions.</p>
<p>However, using an <strong>[out]</strong> parameter instead of a return value for complex data types is recommended. While returning complex data types, the MIDL compiler will generate an /Os mode stub. As a result, all recent error-checking information provided by /robust is lost.</p>
<p>Function return values that are pointer types are allocated by the client stub with a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/midl-user-allocate-1">midl_user_allocate</a>. Accordingly, only the unique or full pointer attribute can be applied to a pointer function-return type.</p>

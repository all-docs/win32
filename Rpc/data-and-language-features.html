<h1>Data and Language Features</h1>
<p>The Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) provides the set of features that extend the C programming language to support remote procedure calls. MIDL is not a variation of C; it is a strongly typed formal language through which you can control the data transmitted over a network. MIDL is designed so that developers familiar with C can learn it quickly.</p>
<p>This topic discusses three language features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="strong-typing.html">Strong Typing</a></li>
<li><a href="directional-parameter-attributes.html">Directional (Parameter) Attributes</a></li>
<li><a href="data-representation.html">Data Representation</a></li>
</ul>

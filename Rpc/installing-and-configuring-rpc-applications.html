<h1>Installing and Configuring RPC Applications</h1>
<p>When the Microsoft Windows operating system is installed on a server or client, setup automatically installs the RPC run-time files. No further RPC installation is required. You must ensure, however, that the version of Windows you install supports all the features used in your distributed application.</p>
<p>When you use an RPC application on a Windows 3.x or Microsoft MS-DOS operating system, you must copy the RPC run-time executable files to the Windows 3.x or MS-DOS computers that will be using the application. The directory \mstools\rpc_rt16 on the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) CD contains a disk image of these files along with a setup program to install the files. Use this disk image to create an install disk for distribution with your RPC application. You can also use 16-bit client applications targeted toward MS-DOS or Windows on a 32-bit/64-bit Windows operating system. However, your application's installation program must install the executable files contained in this disk image.</p>
<p>When you build an RPC application for a Macintosh client, you must link the necessary files to the application at build time. No additional RPC installation is needed.</p>

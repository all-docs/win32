<h1>Developing the Interface</h1>
<p>An RPC interface describes the remote functions that the server program implements. The interface ensures that the client and server communicate using the same rules when the client invokes a remote procedure that the server offers. An interface consists of an interface name, some attributes, optional type or constant definitions, and a set of procedure declarations. Each procedure declaration must contain a procedure name, return type, and parameter list.</p>
<p>Interfaces are defined in the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL). If you are familiar with C or C++, MIDL interface definitions will seem fairly straightforward. MIDL resembles C and C++ in many ways.</p>
<p>When developing an RPC application, a text editor is used to define the interface and store it in a text file with an .idl extension. For more information, see <a href="the-idl-and-acf-files.html">The IDL and ACF Files</a>. The MIDL compiler generates a header file that your program includes in the client and server source files. The MIDL compiler also generates two C source files. You compile and link one of these to your client program, and the other to your server program. These two C source files are the client and server stubs. For an overview of the client and server stubs, see <a href="how-rpc-works.html">How RPC Works</a>. For an overview on the MIDL compiler, see <a href="using-midl.html">Compiling a MIDL File</a>.</p>
<p>By default, the client and server stub have the same name, which can cause problems if the client links with the server stub, or vice-versa. Using the MIDL <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/-prefix"><strong>/prefix</strong></a> option prevents this common error from occurring.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the process of creating an interface.</p>

<p>It is possible that you will also need to specify an application configuration file (ACF) for input to the MIDL compiler as well. For more information on application configuration files, see <a href="the-idl-and-acf-files.html">The IDL and ACF Files</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the MIDL compiler, you will typically need to use the Uuidgen utility to generate a Universal Unique Identifier (UUID, interchangeable with the term GUID). This section presents information on both of these tools, divided into the following topics:</p>

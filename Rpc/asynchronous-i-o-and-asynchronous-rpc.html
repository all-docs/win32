<h1>Asynchronous I/O and Asynchronous RPC</h1>
<p>Asynchronous I/O is an efficient means for a single thread to manage multiple I/O requests simultaneously. Asynchronous RPC on the server accomplishes a similar purpose for RPC requests. In versions of Windows prior to WindowsÂ Vista, posting asynchronous I/O requests from server procedures using asynchronous RPC is discouraged. However, in WindowsÂ Vista and later versions of Windows, asynchronous I/O requests that are associated with an I/O completion port are supported by asynchronous RPC.</p>
<p>Prior to WindowsÂ Vista, an asynchronous remote procedure call may complete before the asynchronous I/O request completes. When the asynchronous call completes, its thread may terminate if the RPC runtime decides it has enough threads available to service the expected workload. The system binds all I/O requests to the thread that initiates them. If the thread terminates, any I/O requests pending on that thread are aborted. Pending I/O requests cannot be moved to another thread.</p>
<p>Therefore, application designers targeting versions of Windows prior to WindowsÂ Vista can either use synchronous I/O in server procedures, or they can forward all requests that involve asynchronous I/O to procedures executing on a thread pool that the application manages. The Windows API provides functions for thread-pool management. See <a href="/windows/desktop/ProcThread/process-and-thread-functions">Process and Thread Functions</a>.</p>

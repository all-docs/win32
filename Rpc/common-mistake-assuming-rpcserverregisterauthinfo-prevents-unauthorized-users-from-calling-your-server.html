<h1>RpcServerRegisterAuthInfo doesn't deny unauthorized users</h1>
<p>When security providers are registered on the server with the <a href="/windows/win32/api/Rpcdce/nf-rpcdce-rpcserverregisterauthinfo"><strong>RpcServerRegisterAuthInfo</strong></a> function, an authentication <em>option</em> is added; not an authentication <em>requirement</em>. That means that previous registrations with <strong>RpcServerRegisterAuthInfo</strong> aren't replaced. It also means that an unauthenticated client that could connect before can still connect.</p>
<p>Just calling the <strong>RpcServerRegisterAuthInfo</strong> function doesn't disallow unauthenticated clients from connecting. If they could connect before, then they can still connect; but function calls such as <a href="/windows/win32/api/Rpcdce/nf-rpcdce-rpcimpersonateclient"><strong>RpcImpersonateClient</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/Rpcasync/nf-rpcasync-rpcgetauthorizationcontextforclient"><strong>RpcGetAuthorizationContextForClient</strong></a> will fail. So when the <strong>RpcServerRegisterAuthInfo</strong> function is called, potential attackers have not been weeded outâ€”rather, authorized clients are given a chance to prove their identity. So you must still put in place checks to determine whether potential attackers are attempting to connect.</p>

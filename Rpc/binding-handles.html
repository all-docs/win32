<h1>Binding Handles</h1>
<p>Binding is the process of creating a logical connection between a client program and a server program. The information that composes the binding between client and server is represented by a structure called a binding handle.</p>
<p>A binding handle is analogous to a file handle that the fopen C run-time library function returns, or a window handle that the function <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-createwindowa"><strong>CreateWindow</strong></a> returns.</p>
<p>As with these handles, your application cannot directly access and manipulate the information in the binding handle. The information in a binding handle data structure is available only to the RPC run-time libraries. You provide the handle, the run-time libraries access and manipulate the appropriate data.</p>

<h1>Deploying Load Balancing</h1>
<p>The typical deployment environment and use case is which the RPC Load balancer is utilized is shown below:<img src="images/rpc-load-balancing.png" alt="rpc load balancing" /></p>
<ol>
<li>The RPC client makes an RPC/HTTP connection to the server farm.</li>
<li>The connection is forwarded through the network to a front end load balancer</li>
<li>The front end load balancer chooses a server to service the request. In this example, the front end load balancer forwards the connection to Server 1.</li>
<li>The RPC Load balancer service arbitrates the connection. It determines that this is the first connection from the client and associates the connection with the local server, Server 1.</li>
<li>The client makes a second RPC/HTTP request.</li>
<li>The request is forwarded through the network to the front end load balancer.</li>
<li>The front end load balancer chooses a server to service the request. In this case, the front end load balancer chooses Server 2 to service the request.</li>
<li>The RPC Load Balancer service arbitrates the connection. It recognizes that connections from this client is being serviced by Server 1.</li>
<li>The connection is forwarded to Server 1.</li>

<h1>Asynchronous RPC over the Named-Pipe Protocol</h1>
<p>If you use named pipes (<a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/ncacn-np"><strong>ncacn_np</strong></a>) as your transport protocol, you should avoid allowing a large number of idle pending calls on the server. With named pipes, each client waiting for a reply will have a pending named pipe read on the server, each of which requires a certain amount of kernel memory.</p>
<p>For example, you would not want to use a notification call for new e-mail with the named-pipe transport, because such a call would remain pending even when clients are idle, and kernel memory could be depleted. Note that this is not a problem with the other connection-oriented protocols, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/ncacn-ip-tcp"><strong>ncacn_ip_tcp</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Since named pipes are a transport protocol, your application can use them by specifying <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/ncacn-np"><strong>ncacn_np</strong></a> as the protocol in a string binding. For more information on named pipes, see <a href="/windows/desktop/ipc/named-pipes">Named Pipes</a>. For details on creating string bindings, see <a href="finding-server-host-systems.html">Using String Bindings</a>.</p>

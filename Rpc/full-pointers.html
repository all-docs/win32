<h1>Full Pointers</h1>
<p>Unlike <a href="unique-pointers.html">unique</a> pointers, full pointers support aliasing. This means that multiple pointers can refer to the same data, as shown in the following figure:</p>
<p><img src="images/prog-a02.png" alt="two pointers referencing the same data" /></p>
<p>A full pointer has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can have the value null.</li>
<li>It can change from null to non-null during the call. When the value changes to non-null, the client stub allocates new memory allocated on return. The client program should free this memory before it terminates.</li>
<li>It can change from non-null to null during the call. When the value changes to null, the application is responsible for freeing the memory.</li>
<li>The value can change from one non-null value to another.</li>
<li>The storage that a full pointer points to may be accessed by another pointer or name in the operation.</li>
<li>Return data is written into existing storage if the pointer does not have the value null.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the [ <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/ptr"><strong>ptr</strong></a> ] attribute to specify a full pointer, as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>/* IDL file */
[ 
  uuid(ba209999-0c6c-11d2-97cf-00c04f8eea45),
  version(1.0)
]
interface FullPtrInterface
{
  void RemoteFn([in,ptr,string]) char *ptrName1,
                [in,ptr,string]  char *ptrName2);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example the parameters <em>ptrName1</em> and <em>ptrName2</em> are defined as full pointers to a string. It is possible for both pointers to point to the same memory address containing a single string.</p>
<p>[<strong>ptr</strong>] is required when providing aliasing support. However, since it requires the most processing of all the pointers available in RPC, it is not recommended for most applications.</p>

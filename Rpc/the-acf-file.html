<h1>The ACF File</h1>
<p>The ACF file enables you to customize your client and/or server applications' RPC interface without affecting the network characteristics of the interface. For example, if your client application contains a complex data structure that only has meaning on the local machine, you can specify in the ACF file how the data in that structure can be represented in a machine-independent form for remote procedure calls.</p>
<p>This tutorial demonstrates another use of the ACF fileâ€”specifying the type of binding handle that represents the connection between client and server. The <strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/implicit-handle"><strong>implicit_handle</strong></a><strong>]</strong> attribute in the ACF header allows the client application to select a server for its remote procedure call. The ACF defines the handle to be of the type <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/handle-t"><strong>handle_t</strong></a> (a MIDL primitive data type). The MIDL compiler will put the binding handle name that the ACF specified, hello_IfHandle into the header file it generates. Notice that this particular ACF file has an empty body.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>//file: hello.acf
[
    implicit_handle (handle_t hello_IfHandle)
] 
interface hello
{
}
</code></pre>
<p>The MIDL compiler has an option, <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/-app-config"><strong>/app_config</strong></a>, that lets you include certain ACF attributes, such as <strong>implicit_handle</strong>, in the IDL file, rather than creating a separate ACF file. Consider using this option if your application doesn't require a lot of special configuration and if strict OSF compatibility is not an issue.</p>

<h1>Receiving the Asynchronous Reply</h1>
<p>After it is notified that the server has sent a reply, the client calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rpcasync/nf-rpcasync-rpcasynccompletecall"><strong>RpcAsyncCompleteCall</strong></a> with the asynchronous handle so that it can receive the reply. When <strong>RpcAsyncCompleteCall</strong> has completed successfully, the <em>Reply</em> parameter points to a buffer that contains the return value of the remote function. Any buffers supplied by the client program as [<a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/out-idl"><strong>out</strong></a>] or [<a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/in"><strong>in</strong></a>, <strong>out</strong>] parameters to the asynchronous remote function contain valid data. If the client calls <strong>RpcAsyncCompleteCall</strong> before the server has sent the reply, that call will fail and return a value of RPC_S_ASYNC_CALL_PENDING.</p>
<p>If your client program uses I/O completion ports or events for notification, it must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle"><strong>CloseHandle</strong></a> to release the port or handle when it no longer needs them.</p>

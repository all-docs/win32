<h1>Do Not Use Endpoint Security</h1>
<p>Endpoint security is a security model in which a security descriptor is given when an endpoint is created with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rpcdce/nf-rpcdce-rpcserveruseprotseq"><strong>RpcServerUseProtseq</strong></a>* group of RPC functions. Do not use this security model. Do not give security descriptors to those functions. At best, this method is a waste of CPU resources. At worst, in many environments it is possible to circumvent the security descriptor, as the <a href="be-wary-of-other-rpc-endpoints-running-in-the-same-process.html">Be Wary of Other RPC Endpoints Running In the Same Process</a> section exemplifies.</p>
<p>Endpoint security exists only for backward compatibility.</p>

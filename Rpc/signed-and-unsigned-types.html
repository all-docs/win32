<h1>Signed and Unsigned Types (RPC)</h1>
<p>Compilers that use different defaults for signed and unsigned types can cause software errors in your distributed application. You can avoid these problems by explicitly declaring your character types as <strong>signed</strong> or <strong>unsigned</strong>.</p>
<p>MIDL defines the <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/small"><strong>small</strong></a> type to take the same default sign as the <strong>char</strong> type in the target C compiler. If the compiler assumes that <strong>char</strong> is unsigned, <strong>small</strong> will also be defined as unsigned. Many C compilers let you change the default as a command-line option. For example, the Microsoft C compiler <strong>/J</strong> command-line option changes the default sign of <strong>char</strong> from signed to unsigned.</p>
<p>You can also control the sign of variables of type <strong>char</strong> and <strong>small</strong> with the MIDL compiler command-line switch <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/-char"><strong>/char</strong></a>. This switch allows you to specify the default sign used by your compiler. The MIDL compiler explicitly declares the sign of all <strong>char</strong> types that do not match your C-compiler default type in the generated header file.</p>

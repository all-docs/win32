<h1>union keyword (RPC)</h1>
<p>Some features of the C language, such as unions, require special MIDL keywords to support their use in remote procedure calls. A union in the C language is a variable that holds objects of different types and sizes. The developer usually creates a variable to keep track of the types stored in the union. To operate correctly in a distributed environment, the variable that indicates the type of the union, or the <em>discriminant</em>, must also be available to the remote computer. MIDL provides the [<a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/switch-type"><strong>switch_type</strong></a>] and [<a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/switch-is"><strong>switch_is</strong></a>] keywords to identify the discriminant type and name.</p>
<p>MIDL requires that the discriminant be transmitted with the union in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The union and the discriminant must be provided as parameters.</li>
<li>The union and the discriminant must be packaged in a structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two fundamental types of discriminated unions are provided by MIDL: <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/nonencapsulated-unions"><strong>nonencapsulated_union</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/encapsulated-unions"><strong>encapsulated_union</strong></a>. The discriminant of a nonencapsulated union is another parameter if the union is a parameter. It is another field if the union is a field of a structure. The definition of an encapsulated union is turned into a structure definition whose first field is the discriminant and whose second and last fields are the union. The following example demonstrates how to provide the union and discriminant as parameters:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>typedef [switch_type(short)] union 
{
    [case(0)]    short     sVal;
    [case(1)]    float     fVal;
    [case(2)]    char      chVal;
    [default]    ;
} DISCRIM_UNION_PARAM_TYPE;
 
short UnionParamProc(
    [in, switch_is(sUtype)] DISCRIM_UNION_PARAM_TYPE Union,
    [in] short sUtype);
</code></pre>
<p>The union in the preceding example can contain a single value: either <strong>short</strong>, <strong>float</strong>, or <strong>char</strong>. The type definition for the union includes the MIDL <strong>switch_type</strong> attribute that specifies the type of the discriminant. Here, [switch_type(short)] specifies that the discriminant is of type <strong>short</strong>. The switch must be an integer type.</p>
<p>If the union is a member of a structure, then the discriminant must be a member of the same structure. If the union is a parameter, then the discriminant must be another parameter. The prototype for the function <strong>UnionParamProc</strong> in the preceding example shows the discriminant <em>sUtype</em> as the last parameter of the call. (The discriminant can appear in any position in the call.) The type of the parameter specified in the <strong>[switch_is]</strong> attribute must match the type specified in the <strong>[switch_type]</strong> attribute.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the use of a single structure that packages the discriminant with the union:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>typedef struct 
{
    short utype;  /* discriminant can precede or follow union */
    [switch_is(utype)] union 
    {
       [case(0)]   short     sVal;
       [case(1)]   float     fVal;
       [case(2)]   char      chVal;
       [default]   ;
    } u;
} DISCRIM_UNION_STRUCT_TYPE;
 
short UnionStructProc(
    [in] DISCRIM_UNION_STRUCT_TYPE u1);
</code></pre>
<p>The Microsoft RPC MIDL compiler allows union declarations outside of <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/typedef"><strong>typedef</strong></a> constructs. This feature is an extension to DCE IDL. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/union"><strong>union</strong></a>.</p>

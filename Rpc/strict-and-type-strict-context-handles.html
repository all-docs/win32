<h1>Strict and Type Strict Context Handles</h1>
<p>Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/strict-context-handle"><strong>strict_context_handle</strong></a> attribute for all context handles. By default, a context handle is not associated with an interface, which means a context handle can be created on one interface, then passed to another. This is an easy attack, and many RPC servers fail to prevent it.</p>
<p>If two interfaces coexist in the same process, an attacker can open a context handle on one interface, and pass it to another, which may trip over the unexpected data. Many developers believe their software is the only interface in a process, but very often that is not the case, because both the system and many third-party components use RPC internally, and those interfaces can create context handles. When the <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/strict-context-handle"><strong>strict_context_handle</strong></a> attribute is used, the RPC run time ensures that a context created on one interface can be passed as an argument only to methods of that interface.</p>
<p>In situations where an application is developed for WindowsÂ Vista, the use of <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/type-strict-context-handle"><strong>type_strict_context_handle</strong></a> is available and recommended. Context handles are not associated with a specific type by default. When multiple types of context handles are used in the same process, it is possible for a malicious client to pass a context handle in place of another to produce undesirable results. The use of <strong>type_strict_context_handle</strong> allows applications to enforce context handle type consistency and prevent any mismatched context handle type usage.</p>

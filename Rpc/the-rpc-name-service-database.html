<h1>The RPC Name Service Database</h1>
<p>A name service is a service that maps names to objects, and usually maintains the (name, object) pairs in a database. Generally, the name is a logical name that is easy for users to remember and use. For example, a name service would allow a user to use the logical name &quot;laserprinter.&quot; The name service maps this name to the network-specific name used by the print server.</p>
<p>To use a simplified explanation, the RPC name service maps a name to a binding handle and maintains the (name, binding handle) mappings in the RPC name service database. The RPC name service allows client applications to use a logical name instead of a specific protocol sequence and network address. The use of the logical name makes it easier for network administrators to install and configure your distributed application.</p>
<p>An RPC name service database entry has one of the following attributes: <strong>server</strong>, <strong>group</strong>, or <strong>profile</strong>. In the Microsoft implementation, entries can have only one attribute, so these entries are also known as server entries, group entries, and profile entries.</p>
<p>The server entry consists of interface UUIDs, object UUIDs (needed when the server implements multiple-entry points), network address, protocol sequence, and any endpoint information associated with well-known endpoints. When a dynamic endpoint is used, the endpoint information is kept in the endpoint-map database rather than the name service database, and the endpoint is resolved like any other dynamic endpoint. Server entries are managed by functions that start with the prefix &quot;RpcNsBinding&quot;.</p>
<p>The group entry can contain server entries or other group entries. Group entries are managed by functions that start with the prefix &quot;RpcNsGroup&quot;.</p>
<p>The profile entry can contain profile, group, or server entries. Profile entries are managed by the functions that start with the prefix &quot;RpcNsProfile&quot;.</p>

<h1>Development vs. Deployment in the Network</h1>
<p>Most developers write and test their software on a fast reliable LAN. Their client and server are often on the same network segment. In such circumstances the network is rarely unresponsive, and connectivity rarely lost. When deployed in a customer environment however, client and server are often on different network segments, possibly geographically remote, and the server is heavily loaded with other clients. In other words: network responsiveness cannot be assumed.</p>
<p>This article explains how to construct robust client/server architectures in the face of uncertainty introduced by an intrinsically unreliable network and potentially unavailable servers.</p>

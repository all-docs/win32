<h1>Unloading a Server with Outstanding Context Handles</h1>
<p>Traditionally, unloading a DLL that services RPC calls using context handles, without first stopping the hosting process, has been problematic. This is because the run-down routine is no longer valid when the DLL is being unloaded. When a client with a previously open context handle fails, and the RPC run time tries to close the context handle, its attempt to call the run-down routine access violates, and the server crashes.</p>
<p>Beginning with WindowsÂ XP, a new API called <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rpcdce/nf-rpcdce-rpcserverunregisterifex"><strong>RpcServerUnregisterIfEx</strong></a> has been added. <strong>RpcServerUnregisterIfEx</strong> closes context handles opened by the interface being unregistered; the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Rpcdce/nf-rpcdce-rpcserverunregisterif"><strong>RpcServerUnregisterIf</strong></a> function does not. Using <strong>RpcServerUnregisterIfEx</strong> is not necessary when the entire process shuts down, but it is necessary if one or more DLLs hosting the run-down routines is unloaded while outstanding context handles exist.</p>

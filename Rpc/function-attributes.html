<h1>Function Attributes</h1>
<p>The <strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/callback"><strong>callback</strong></a><strong>]</strong> and <strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/local"><strong>local</strong></a><strong>]</strong> attributes can be applied as function attributes.</p>
<p>A callback is a remote call from server to client that executes as part of a conceptual single-execution thread. A callback is always issued in the context of a remote call (or callback) and is executed by the thread that issued the original remote call (or callback).</p>
<p>It is often desirable to place a local procedure declaration in the IDL file, since this is the logical place to describe interfaces to a package. The <strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/local"><strong>local</strong></a><strong>]</strong> attribute indicates that a procedure declaration is not actually a remote function, but a local procedure. The MIDL compiler does not generate any stubs for functions with the <strong>[local]</strong> attribute.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the use of <strong>[</strong><a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/callback"><strong>callback</strong></a><strong>]</strong> is not recommended in multi-thread programming. As a single-thread programming function, it is not equipped to support the security demands a multi-thread environment provides.</p>

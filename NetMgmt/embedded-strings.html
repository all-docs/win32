<h1>Embedded Strings</h1>
<p>Information structures will not contain embedded strings. This improves the alignment of the information structures and allows for OEM flexibility in the core functions.</p>
<p>Any information field that is returned in an enumeration call that can be subsequently used as a key for the call to a GetInfo network management function is guaranteed to be present in the enumeration buffer. If the variable-length information string that would specify the key field value will not fit, then the entire fixed-length structure for the entry is not returned. Other variable-length fields will be returned as a <strong>NULL</strong> pointer for the case in which the string does not fit.</p>

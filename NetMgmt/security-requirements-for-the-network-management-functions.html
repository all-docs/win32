<h1>Network management function security requirements</h1>
<p>Calling some of the network management functions does not require special group membership. Other functions require that users have a specific privilege level to execute successfully. When applicable, the Remarks section on a function's reference page indicates the privilege level a user must have to execute the particular function.</p>
<p>Security requirements that apply to Active Directory domain controllers can differ from those that apply to servers and workstations.</p>
<p>For more information, and a list of affected functions, see the following topics:</p>

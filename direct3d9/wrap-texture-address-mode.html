<h1>Wrap Texture Address Mode (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>The wrap texture address mode, identified by the D3DTADDRESS_WRAP member of the <a href="./d3dtextureaddress.html"><strong>D3DTEXTUREADDRESS</strong></a> enumerated type, makes Direct3D repeat the texture on every integer junction. Suppose, for example, your application creates a square primitive and specifies texture coordinates of (0.0,0.0), (0.0,3.0), (3.0,3.0), and (3.0,0.0). Setting the texture addressing mode to D3DTADDRESS_WRAP results in the texture being applied three times in both the u-and v-directions, as shown in the following illustration.</p>

<p>The effects of this texture address mode are similar to, but distinct from, those of the mirror mode. For more information, see <a href="mirror-texture-address-mode.html">Mirror Texture Address Mode (Direct3D 9)</a>.</p>

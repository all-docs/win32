<h1>Anisotropic Texture Filtering (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>The distortion visible in the texels of a 3D object whose surface is oriented at an angle with respect to the plane of the screen is called anisotropy. When a pixel from an anisotropic primitive is mapped to texels, its shape is distorted. Direct3D measures the anisotropy of a pixel as the elongation - that is, length divided by width - of a screen pixel that is inverse-mapped into texture space.</p>
<p>You can use anisotropic texture filtering in conjunction with linear texture filtering or mipmap texture filtering to improve rendering results. Your application enables anisotropic texture filtering by calling the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setsamplerstate"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::SetSamplerState</strong></a> method. Set the value of the first parameter to the integer index number (0-7) of the texture for which you are selecting a texture filtering method. Pass D3DSAMP_MAGFILTER, D3DSAMP_MINFILTER, or D3DSAMP_MIPFILTER for the second parameter to set the magnification, minification, or mipmapping filter. Set the third parameter to D3DTEXF_ANISOTROPIC.</p>
<p>Your application must also set the degree of anisotropy to a value greater than one. Do this by calling the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setsamplerstate"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::SetSamplerState</strong></a> method. Set the value of the first parameter to the integer index number (0-7) of the texture for which you are setting the degree of isotropy. Pass D3DSAMP_MAXANISOTROPY as the value of the second parameter. The final parameter should be the degree of isotropy.</p>
<p>You can disable isotropic filtering by setting the degree of isotropy to one; any value larger than one enables it. Check the MaxAnisotropy flag in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D9Caps/ns-d3d9caps-d3dcaps9"><strong>D3DCAPS9</strong></a> structure to determine the possible range of values for the degree of anisotropy.</p>

<h1>Multiple Views in Windowed Mode (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>In addition to the swap chain that is owned and manipulated through the Direct3DDevice object, an application can use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-createadditionalswapchain"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::CreateAdditionalSwapChain</strong></a> method to create additional swap chains to present multiple views from the same device.</p>
<p>Typically, the application creates one swap chain per view, and it associates each swap chain with a particular view. The application renders images in the back buffers of each swap chain, and then uses the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-present"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::Present</strong></a> method to present them individually. Note that only one swap chain at a time can be full-screen on each adapter.</p>

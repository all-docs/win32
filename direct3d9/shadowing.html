<h1>Shadowing (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Stencil buffers are a depth-buffer technique that can be updated as geometry is rendered, and used again as a mask for drawing more geometry. Common effects include mirrors, shadows (an advanced technique), dissolves, and so on. The <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Ee418792(v=VS.85).aspx">ShadowVolume Sample</a> uses stencil buffers to implement real-time shadows. Additional information is contained in <a href="two-sided-stencil.html">Two-Sided Stencil (Direct3D 9)</a>.</p>

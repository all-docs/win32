<h1>Hardware Considerations for Texturing (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Current hardware does not necessarily implement all the functionality that the Direct3D interface enables. Your application must test user hardware and adjust its rendering strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>Many 3D accelerator cards do not support diffuse iterated values as arguments to blending units. However, your application can introduce iterated color data when it performs texture blending.</p>
<p>Some 3D hardware may not have a blending stage associated with the first texture. On these adapters, your application must perform blending in the second and third texture stages in the set of current textures.</p>
<p>Because of limitations in much of today's hardware, few display adapters can perform trilinear mipmap interpolation through the multiple texture blending interface offered by <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nn-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9</strong></a>. Your application can use multipass texture blending to achieve the same effects, or degrade to the D3DTEXF_POINT mipmap filter mode, which is widely supported.</p>

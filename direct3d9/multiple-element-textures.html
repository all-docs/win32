<h1>Multiple-element Textures (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Traditional textures are considered to be single-element textures. Multiple-element textures enable applications to write simultaneously to multiple elements of a texture from the pixel shader. The result in the next rendering pass is that an application can use one or more of the elements as a single-element texture - that is, as inputs to the pixel shader. These additional elements can be thought of as a temporary store for intermediate results that will be used in a later pass by the application.</p>
<p>The first generation of hardware that exposes this feature has the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>All multiple-element texture surfaces will be allocated automatically. This limitation is addressed by treating this as a new type of surface format with multiple RGBA channels interleaved.</li>
<li>All elements of the multiple element texture can have the same bit depth. This limitation is expressed by the name of the new surface formats.</li>
<li>A multiple-element texture cannot be the primary/displayable. In other words, it must be off-screen only. This limitation is expressed by the surface-format enumeration.</li>
<li>No dithering, alpha test, fogging, blending, raster-op, or masking is allowed. No post-pixel shader processing is done, except the z-test and stencil test.</li>
<li>The texture cannot be a mipmap. Creation of the mip chain will fail.</li>
<li>The same element cannot be set as a texture at the same time it is a render target. However, different elements of the same multiple-element texture surface can simultaneously be textures and render targets.</li>
<li>No antialiasing is supported.</li>
<li>Multiple-element texture surfaces, when used as a texture, cannot be filtered. This limitation can be verified using <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-checkdeviceformat"><strong>CheckDeviceFormat</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Multiple-element texture surfaces cannot be locked.</li>
<li>More than one multiple-element texture surface can be used simultaneously by assigning each to various stages, just as with normal textures.</li>
<li>Multiple-element texture surfaces support conversion of gamma from 2.2 to 1.0 conversion on a read operation, just as with other texture formats.</li>
<li>Some of the implementations do not apply the output write mask (D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE). Those that can have independent color write masks. This is expressed using a new capability bit. The number of independent color write masks available will be equal to the maximum number of elements of which the device is capable.</li>
<li><a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-clear"><strong>Clear</strong></a> clears all elements of the multiple-element texture which is set as the render target.</li>
</ul>
<p>The usage of multiple-element textures follows these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Applications discover support for this feature by checking for the availability of multiple-element texture formats.</li>
<li>The application creates these surfaces by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-createtexture"><strong>CreateTexture</strong></a>.</li>
<li>The application sets the surface as a render target using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>SetRenderTarget</strong></a> call. The pixel shader provides output to the surfaces using the <a href="../direct3dhlsl/mov---ps.html">mov - ps</a> instruction.</li>
<li><a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-settexture"><strong>SetTexture</strong></a> is called to set a multiple-element texture surface to a particular stage. As with other textures, the same surface is allowed to be set to multiple stages at once.</li>
<li><a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setsamplerstate"><strong>SetSamplerState</strong></a> is called to set D3DSAMP_ELEMENTINDEX to the appropriate element number in the multiple-element texture from which the sampler samples. Default value for this state is 0, which means non-multiple-element textures will work. Setting this state to an inappropriate number results in an undefined behavior - if the multiple-element texture is only two elements wide but the sampler is asked to sample from the fourth element, for example.</li>
</ol>
<h2>API Support</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of the API elements that support multiple-element textures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="d3dformat.html">D3DFMT_MULTI2_ARGB8</a> surface format expresses the interleaved nature of the format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The D3DSAMP_ELEMENTINDEX sampler state indicates which element index to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following render states support multiple-element textures:</p>
<ul>
<li>D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE1</li>
<li>D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE2</li>
<li>D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE3</li>
</ul>
<p>D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE applies to render target (or element) zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="d3dpmisccaps.html">D3DPMISCCAPS_INDEPENDENTWRITEMASKS</a> flag indicates that the device supports independent write masks for multiple element textures or multiple render targets.</p>
</li>
</ul>

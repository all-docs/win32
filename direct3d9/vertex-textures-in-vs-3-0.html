<h1>Vertex Textures in vs_3_0 (DirectX HLSL)</h1>
<p>The vertex shader 3.0 model supports texture lookup in the vertex shader using the <a href="../direct3dhlsl/texldl---vs.html">texldl - vs</a> texture load statement. The vertex engine contains four texture sampler stages, named <a href="d3dvertextexturesampler.html">D3DVERTEXTEXTURESAMPLER0</a>, D3DVERTEXTEXTURESAMPLER1, D3DVERTEXTEXTURESAMPLER2, and D3DVERTEXTEXTURESAMPLER3. These are distinct from the displacement map sampler and texture samplers in the pixel engine.</p>
<p>To sample textures set at those four stages, you can use the vertex engine and program the stages with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>CheckDeviceFormat</strong></a> method. Set textures at those stages using <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-settexture"><strong>SetTexture</strong></a>, with the stage index <a href="d3dvertextexturesampler.html">D3DVERTEXTEXTURESAMPLER0</a> through D3DVERTEXTEXTURESAMPLER3. A new register has been introduced in the vertex shader, the sampler register (like in ps_2_0), which represents the vertex texture sampler. This register needs to be defined in the shader before using it.</p>
<p>An application can query if a format is supported as a vertex texture by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>CheckDeviceFormat</strong></a> with <a href="d3dusage-query.html">D3DUSAGE_QUERY_VERTEXTEXTURE</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
This is a query flag so it is not accepted in any Createxxx function. A vertex texture created in the default pool can be set as a pixel texture and vice versa. However, to use the software vertex processing, the vertex texture must be created in the scratch pool (no matter if it is a mixed-mode device or a software vertex processing device).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The functionality is identical to the pixel textures, except for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anisotropic texture filtering is not supported, hence D3DSAMP_MAXANISOTROPY is ignored and D3DTEXF_ANISOTROPIC cannot be set for magnify, or minify for these stages.</li>
<li>Rate of change information is not available, hence the application has to compute the level of detail and provide that information as a parameter to <a href="../direct3dhlsl/texldl---vs.html">texldl - vs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Restrictions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>As in pixel shaders, if multielement textures are supported, D3DSAMP_ELEMENTINDEX is used to figure out which element to sample from.</li>
<li>The state D3DSAMP_DMAPOFFSET is ignored for these stages.</li>
<li>Use <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>CheckDeviceFormat</strong></a> with <a href="d3dusage-query.html">D3DUSAGE_QUERY_VERTEXTEXTURE&quot;</a> to query a texture to see if it can be used as a vertex texture.</li>
<li>VertexTextureFilterCaps indicates what kind of filters are allowed at the vertex texture samplers. <a href="d3dptfiltercaps.html">D3DPTFILTERCAPS_MINFANISOTROPIC</a> and D3DPTFILTERCAPS_MAGFANISOTROPIC are disallowed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sampling Stage Registers</h2>
<p>A sampling stage register identifies a sampling unit that can be used in texture load statements. A sampling unit corresponds to the texture sampling stage, encapsulating the sampling-specific state provided in <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setsamplerstate"><strong>SetSamplerState</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Each sampler uniquely identifies a single texture surface that is set to the corresponding sampler using <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-settexture"><strong>SetTexture</strong></a>. However, the same texture surface can be set at multiple samplers.</p>
<p>At draw time, a texture cannot be simultaneously set as a render target and a texture at a stage.</p>
<p>Because vs_3_0 supports four samplers, up to four texture surfaces can be read from in a single shader pass. A sampler register might appear only as an argument in the texture load statement: <a href="../direct3dhlsl/texldl---vs.html">texldl - vs</a>.</p>
<p>In vs_3_0, if you use a sampler, it must be declared at the beginning of the shader program, using the <a href="../direct3dhlsl/dcl-samplertype---vs.html">dcl_samplerType (sm3 - vs asm)</a> (as in ps_2_0).</p>
<h2>Software Processing</h2>
<p>This feature will be supported in software vertex processing. The specific filter types supported can be checked by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-getdevicecaps"><strong>GetDeviceCaps</strong></a> and checking VertexTextureFilterCaps. All published texture formats will be supported as vertex textures in software vertex processing.</p>
<p>Applications can check if a particular texture format is supported in the software vertex processing mode by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>CheckDeviceFormat</strong></a> and providing (D3DVERTEXTEXTURESAMPLER | <a href="d3dusage.html"><strong>D3DUSAGE_SOFTWAREPROCESSING</strong></a>) as usage. All formats are supported for software vertex processing. The scratch pool is required for software vertex processing.</p>

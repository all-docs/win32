<h1>Border Color Texture Address Mode (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>The border color texture address mode, identified by the D3DTADDRESS_BORDER member of the <a href="./d3dtextureaddress.html"><strong>D3DTEXTUREADDRESS</strong></a> enumerated type, causes Direct3D to use an arbitrary color, known as the border color, for any texture coordinates outside the range of 0.0 through 1.0, inclusive.</p>
<p>In the following illustration, the application specifies that the texture be applied to the primitive using a red border.</p>
<p><img src="images/border.png" alt="illustration of a texture and a texture with a red border" /></p>
<p>Applications set the border color by calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setsamplerstate"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::SetSamplerState</strong></a>. Set the first parameter for the call to the desired texture stage identifier, the second parameter to the D3DSAMP_BORDERCOLOR stage state value, and the third parameter to the new RGBA border color.</p>

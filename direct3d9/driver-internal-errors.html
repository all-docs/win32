<h1>Driver Internal Errors (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>In Direct3D 9, Direct3D will allow the driver to return error codes such as E_OUTOFMEMORY, D3DERR_OUTOFVIDEOMEMORY, and D3DERR_UNSUPPORTEDCOLORARG so that an application would be able to respond to them. However, sometimes the API calls that generated these return types get loaded into a command buffer and are batched up to be sent to the GPU (see <a href="accurately-profiling-direct3d-api-calls.html">Controlling Runtime and Driver Optimizations</a>). In this case, the errors cannot be relayed to the application when action needs to be taken, so the error code is consumed by the runtime and a note is made on the device object that this happened. Later when the application invokes <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-present"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::Present</strong></a>, <strong>IDirect3DDevice9::Present</strong> will return D3DERR_DRIVERINTERNALERROR. This is why the best approach for an application to take when receiving a D3DERR_DRIVERINTERNALERROR from <strong>IDirect3DDevice9::Present</strong> is to destroy and recreate the device.</p>
<p>If you want to try to debug further, here are a couple of suggestions for trying to figure out which API call is generating the error:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because the list of possible return values is not complete, you can try to find which call is failing by surrounding each API call like this:</p>
<pre><code>TRACE ( &quot;Calling DrawPrimitive&quot; );
d3ddev-&gt;DrawPrim(...);
TRACE ( &quot;done\n&quot; );
</code></pre>
<p>The output debug stream should then show the call that is causing the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, for debugging purposes, try calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-validatedevice"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::ValidateDevice</strong></a> immediately before each <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-drawprimitive"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::DrawPrimitive</strong></a> to see if there is an additional problem with the device driver (unsupported operation, unusable combination of texture formats, etc).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
<a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-validatedevice"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::ValidateDevice</strong></a> should be used carefully and sparingly because of the amount of validation work the driver needs to perform to return an answer.</p>

<h1>Presenting Multiple Views in Windowed Mode (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>In addition to the swap chain that is owned and manipulated through the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9</strong></a> interface, an application can create additional swap chains in order to present multiple views from the same device. The application typically creates one swap chain per view by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-createadditionalswapchain"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::CreateAdditionalSwapChain</strong></a> method, and associates each swap chain with a particular window. The application renders images into the back buffers of each swap chain, and then presents them individually.</p>
<p>Only one swap chain at a time can be full-screen on each adapter.</p>

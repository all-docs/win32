<h1>Direct3D Architecture (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>This topic provides two high-level views of the architecture of Direct3D:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#direct3d-graphics-pipeline">Direct3D Graphics Pipeline</a> - A view of the internal processing architecture of the Direct3D rendering system.</li>
<li><a href="#direct3d-system-integration">Direct3D System Integration</a> - A view of how Direct3D mediates between an application and the graphics hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Direct3D Graphics Pipeline</h2>
<p>The graphics pipeline provides the horsepower to efficiently process and render Direct3D scenes to a display, taking advantage of available hardware. The following diagram shows the building blocks of the pipeline:</p>

<h2>Direct3D System Integration</h2>
<p>The following diagram shows the relationships between a Window application, Direct3D,GDI, and the hardware:</p>
<p><img src="images/d3dsysint.png" alt="diagram of the relationship between direct3d and other system components" /></p>
<p>Direct3D exposes a device-independent interface to an application. Direct3D applications can exist alongside GDI applications, and both have access to the computer's graphics hardware through the device driver for the graphics card. Unlike GDI, Direct3D can take advantage of hardware features by creating a hal device.</p>
<p>A hal device provides hardware acceleration to graphics pipeline functions, based upon the feature set supported by the graphics card. Direct3D methods are provided to retrieve device display capabilities at run time. (See <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-getdevicecaps"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::GetDeviceCaps</strong></a>.) If a capability is not provided by the hardware, the hal does not report it as a hardware capability.</p>
<p>For more information about hal and reference devices supported by Direct3D, see <a href="device-types.html">Device Types (Direct3D 9)</a>.</p>

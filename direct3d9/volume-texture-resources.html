<h1>Volume Texture Resources (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Volume textures are three-dimensional collections of pixels (texels) that can be used to paint a two-dimensional primitive such as a triangle or a line. Three-element texture coordinates are required for each vertex of a primitive that is to be textured with a volume. As the primitive is drawn, each contained pixel is filled with the color value from some pixel within the volume, in accordance with rules analogous to the two-dimensional texture case. Volumes are not rendered directly because there are no three-dimensional primitives that can be painted with them.</p>
<p>You can use volume textures for special effects such as patchy fog, explosions, and so on.</p>
<p>Volumes are organized into slices and can be thought of as width x height 2D surfaces stacked to make a width x height x depth volume. Each slice is a single row. Volumes can have subsequent levels in which the dimensions of each level are truncated to half the dimensions of the previous level. The following diagram shows what a volume texture with multiple levels looks like.</p>

<h2>Creating a Volume Texture</h2>
<p>The code examples below show the steps required to use a volume texture.</p>
<p>First, specify a custom vertex type that has three texture coordinates for each vertex, as shown in this code example.</p>
<pre><code>struct VOLUMEVERTEX
{
    FLOAT x, y, z;
    DWORD color;
    FLOAT tu, tv, tw;
};

#define D3DFVF_VOLUMEVERTEX (D3DFVF_XYZ|D3DFVF_DIFFUSE|
                             D3DFVF_TEX1|D3DFVF_TEXCOORDSIZE3(0))
</code></pre>
<p>Next, fill the vertices with data.</p>
<pre><code>VOLUMEVERTEX g_vVertices[4] =
{
    { 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0xffffffff, 1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f },
    {-1.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0xffffffff, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f },
    { 1.0f,-1.0f, 0.0f, 0xffffffff, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f },
    {-1.0f,-1.0f, 0.0f, 0xffffffff, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now, create a vertex buffer and fill it with data from the vertices.</p>
<p>The next step is to use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-createvolumetexture"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::CreateVolumeTexture</strong></a> method to create a volume texture, as shown in this code example.</p>
<pre><code>LPDIRECT3DVOLUMETEXTURE9 pVolumeTexture;
d3dDevice-&gt;CreateVolumeTexture( 8, 4, 4, 1, 0, D3DFMT_R8G8B8,D3DPOOL_MANAGED, 
                                &amp;pVolumeTexture );
</code></pre>
<p>Before rendering the primitive, set the current texture to the volume texture created above. The code example below shows the entire rendering process for a strip of triangles.</p>
<pre><code>if( SUCCEEDED( d3dDevice-&gt;BeginScene() ) )
{
    // Draw the quad, with the volume texture.
    d3dDevice-&gt;SetTexture( 0, pVolumeTexture );
    d3dDevice-&gt;SetFVF( D3DFVF_VOLUMEVERTEX );
    d3dDevice-&gt;SetStreamSource( 0, pVB, sizeof(VOLUMEVERTEX) );
    d3dDevice-&gt;DrawPrimitive( D3DPT_TRIANGLESTRIP, 0, 2);

   // End the scene.
   d3dDevice-&gt;EndScene();
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Accessing Surface Memory Directly (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>You can directly access the surface memory by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DSurface9::LockRect</strong></a> method. When you call this method, the pRect parameter is a pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect"><strong>RECT</strong></a> structure that describes the rectangle on the surface to access directly. To request that the entire surface be locked, set pRect to <strong>NULL</strong>. Also, you can specify a <strong>RECT</strong> that covers only a portion of the surface. Providing that no two rectangles overlap, two threads or processes can simultaneously lock multiple rectangles in a surface. Note that a multisample back buffer cannot be locked.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DSurface9::LockRect</strong></a> method fills a <a href="d3dlocked-rect.html"><strong>D3DLOCKED_RECT</strong></a> structure with all the information to properly access the surface memory. The structure includes information about the pitch and has a pointer to the locked bits. When you finish accessing the surface memory, call the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3dsurface9-unlockrect"><strong>IDirect3DSurface9::UnlockRect</strong></a> method to unlock it.</p>
<p>While you have a surface locked, you can directly manipulate the contents. The following list describes some tips for avoiding common problems with directly rendering surface memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never assume a constant display pitch. Always examine the pitch information returned by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DSurface9::LockRect</strong></a> method. This pitch can vary for a number of reasons, including the location of the surface memory, the display card type, or even the version of the Direct3D driver. For more information, see <a href="width-vs--pitch.html">Width vs. Pitch (Direct3D 9)</a>.</li>
<li>Make certain you copy to unlocked surfaces. Direct3D copy methods will fail if called on a locked surface.</li>
<li>Limit your application's activity while a surface is locked.</li>
<li>Always copy data aligned to display memory. Windows 98 uses a page fault handler, Vflatd.386, to implement a virtual flat-frame buffer for display cards with bank-switched memory. The handler allows these display devices to present a linear frame buffer to Direct3D. Copying data unaligned to display memory can cause the system to suspend operations if the copy spans memory banks.</li>
<li>A surface may not be locked if it belongs to a resource assigned to the D3DPOOL_DEFAULT memory pool unless it is a dynamic texture or a surface created using <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::CreateOffscreenPlainSurface</strong></a>. Back buffer surfaces, which may be accessed using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::GetBackBuffer</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DSwapChain9::GetBackBuffer</strong></a> methods, may be locked only if the swap chain was created with the Flags member of <a href="d3dpresent-parameters.html"><strong>D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS</strong></a> to include D3DPRESENTFLAG_LOCKABLE_BACKBUFFER.</li>
</ul>

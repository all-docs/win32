<h1>Multiple Render Targets (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Multiple Render Targets (MRT) refers to the ability to render to multiple surfaces (see <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3D9Surface</strong></a>) with a single draw call. These surfaces can be created independently of each other. Render targets can be set using <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setrendertarget"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::SetRenderTarget</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Multiple render targets have the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All render target surfaces used together must have the same bit depth but can be of different formats, unless the D3DPMISCCAPS_MRTINDEPENDENTBITDEPTHS cap is set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All surfaces of a multiple render target should have the same width and height.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some implementations cannot perform post-pixel shader operations on multiple render targets, including: no dithering, alpha test, no fogging, no blending or masking, except the z-test and stencil test. Devices that can support post-pixel shader operations set the cap bit to D3DPMISCCAPS_MRTPOSTPIXELSHADERBLENDING.</p>
<p>When the D3DPMISCCAPS_MRTPOSTPIXELSHADERBLENDING cap is set, you must first consult the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-checkdeviceformat"><strong>IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceFormat</strong></a> with the USAGE_QUERY_POSTPIXELSHADER_BLENDING result for the specific surface format. If false, no post-pixel shader blending operations will be available for that specific surface format. If true, the device is expected to apply the same state to all simultaneous render targets as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpha blend: The color value in oCi is blended with the ith render target.</li>
<li>Alpha test: Comparison will happen with oC0. If the comparison fails, the pixel test is terminated for all render targets.</li>
<li>Fog: Render target 0 will get fogged. Other render targets are undefined. Implementations can choose to fog them all using the same state.</li>
<li>Dithering: Undefined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>No antialiasing is supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the implementations do not apply the output write mask (D3DRS_COLORWRITEENABLE). Those that can, have independent color write masks. This is expressed using a new capability bit. The number of independent color write masks available will be equal to the maximum number of elements the device is capable of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>New hardware caps:</p>
<pre><code>D3DCAPS9.NumSimultaneousRTs         
// The value is 1 for all hardware except those that  
//   can support this feature. It is never 0.
D3DPMISCCAPS_MRTINDEPENDENTBITDEPTHS - True if the hardware can support it
D3DPMISCCAPS_MRTPOSTPIXELSHADERBLENDING - True if the hardware can support it
</code></pre>

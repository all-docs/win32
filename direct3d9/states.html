<h1>States (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>A Direct3D device uses states to set-up all of the pipeline processing. Sampler states control the set-up of the texture samplers by defining texture addressing and filter modes for example. Texture states set-up the multi-texture blender which controls how textures are combined and blended with each other. Render states control most of the pipeline state.</p>
<p>State blocks are a convenient mechanism for saving and restoring state. See <a href="state-blocks-save-and-restore-state.html">State Blocks Save and Restore State (Direct3D 9)</a></p>

<h1>D3DX_FILTER</h1>
<p>The following flags are used to specify which channels in a texture to operate on.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>#define</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_NONE</td>
<td>No scaling or filtering will take place. Pixels outside the bounds of the source image are assumed to be transparent black.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_POINT</td>
<td>Each destination pixel is computed by sampling the nearest pixel from the source image.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_LINEAR</td>
<td>Each destination pixel is computed by sampling the four nearest pixels from the source image. This filter works best when the scale on both axes is less than two.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_TRIANGLE</td>
<td>Every pixel in the source image contributes equally to the destination image. This is the slowest of the filters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_BOX</td>
<td>Each pixel is computed by averaging a 2x2(x2) box of pixels from the source image. This filter works only when the dimensions of the destination are half those of the source, as is the case with mipmaps.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_U</td>
<td>Pixels off the edge of the texture on the u-axis should be mirrored, not wrapped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_V</td>
<td>Pixels off the edge of the texture on the v-axis should be mirrored, not wrapped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_W</td>
<td>Pixels off the edge of the texture on the w-axis should be mirrored, not wrapped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR</td>
<td>Specifying this flag is the same as specifying the D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_U, D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_V, and D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_W flags.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_DITHER</td>
<td>The resulting image must be dithered using a 4x4 ordered dither algorithm.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_SRGB_IN</td>
<td>Input data is in sRGB (gamma 2.2) color space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_SRGB_OUT</td>
<td>The output data is in sRGB (gamma 2.2) color space.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D3DX_FILTER_SRGB</td>
<td>Same as specifying D3DX_FILTER_SRGB_IN | D3DX_FILTER_SRGB_OUT.</td>
</tr>

<p>Each valid filter must contain exactly one of the following flags: D3DX_FILTER_NONE, D3DX_FILTER_POINT, D3DX_FILTER_LINEAR, D3DX_FILTER_TRIANGLE, or D3DX_FILTER_BOX. In addition, you can use the OR operator to specify zero or more of the following optional flags with a valid filter: D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_U, D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_V, D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR_W, D3DX_FILTER_MIRROR, D3DX_FILTER_DITHER, D3DX_FILTER_SRGB_IN, D3DX_FILTER_SRGB_OUT or D3DX_FILTER_SRGB.</p>
<p>Specifying D3DX_DEFAULT for this parameter is usually the equivalent of specifying D3DX_FILTER_TRIANGLE | D3DX_FILTER_DITHER. However, D3DX_DEFAULT can have different meanings, depending on which method uses the filter. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using <a href="d3dxcreatetexturefromfileex.html"><strong>D3DXCreateTextureFromFileEx</strong></a>, D3DX_DEFAULT maps to D3DX_FILTER_TRIANGLE | D3DX_FILTER_DITHER.</li>
<li>When using <a href="d3dxfiltertexture.html"><strong>D3DXFilterTexture</strong></a>, D3DX_DEFAULT maps to D3DX_FILTER_BOX if the texture size is a power of two, and D3DX_FILTER_BOX | D3DX_FILTER_DITHER otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reference each method to check for information about how D3DX_DEFAULT filter is mapped.</p>

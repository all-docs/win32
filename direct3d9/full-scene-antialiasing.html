<h1>Full-Scene Antialiasing (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Full-scene antialiasing refers to blurring the edges of each polygon in the scene as it is rasterized in a single pass; no second pass is required. Full-scene antialiasing, when supported, affects only triangles and groups of triangles. Lines cannot be antialiased by using Direct3D services. Full-scene antialiasing is done in Direct3D by using multisampling on each pixel. When multisampling is enabled, all subsamples of a pixel are updated in one pass but when used for other effects that involve multiple rendering passes, the application can specify that only some subsamples are to be affected by a given rendering pass. This latter approach enables simulation of motion blur, depth-of-field focus effects, reflection blur, and so on.</p>
<p>In both cases, the various samples recorded for each pixel are blended together and output to the screen. This enables the improved image quality of antialiasing or other effects.</p>
<p>Before creating a device with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3D9::CreateDevice</strong></a> method, you need to determine if full-scene antialiasing is supported. Do this by calling the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-checkdevicemultisampletype"><strong>IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceMultiSampleType</strong></a> method as shown in the code example below.</p>
<pre><code>/*
* The code below assumes that pD3D is a valid pointer 
*   to a IDirect3D9 interface.
*/

if( SUCCEEDED(pD3D-&gt;CheckDeviceMultiSampleType( D3DADAPTER_DEFAULT, 
                    D3DDEVTYPE_HAL , D3DFMT_R8G8B8, FALSE, 
                    D3DMULTISAMPLE_2_SAMPLES, NULL ) ) )
// Full-scene antialiasing is supported. Enable it here.
</code></pre>
<p>The first parameter that <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-checkdevicemultisampletype"><strong>IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceMultiSampleType</strong></a> accepts is an ordinal number that denotes the display adapter to query. This sample uses D3DADAPTER_DEFAULT to specify the primary display adapter. The second parameter is a value from the <a href="./d3ddevtype.html"><strong>D3DDEVTYPE</strong></a> enumerated type, specifying the device type. The third parameter specifies the format of the surface. The fourth parameter tells Direct3D whether to inquire about full-windowed multisampling (<strong>TRUE</strong>) or full-scene antialiasing (<strong>FALSE</strong>). This sample uses <strong>FALSE</strong> to tell Direct3D that it is inquiring about full-scene antialiasing. The last parameter specifies the multisampling technique that you want to test. Use a value from the <a href="./d3dmultisample-type.html"><strong>D3DMULTISAMPLE_TYPE</strong></a> enumerated type. This sample tests to see if two levels of multisampling are supported.</p>
<p>If the device supports the level of multisampling that you want to use, the next step is to set the presentation parameters by filling in the appropriate members of the <a href="d3dpresent-parameters.html"><strong>D3DPRESENT_PARAMETERS</strong></a> structure to create a multisample rendering surface. After that, you can create the device. The sample code below shows how to set up a device with a multisampling render surface.</p>
<pre><code>/*
* The example below assumes that pD3D is a valid pointer 
* to a IDirect3D9 interface, d3dDevice is a pointer to a 
* IDirect3DDevice9 interface, and hWnd is a valid handle
* to a window.
*/

D3DPRESENT_PARAMETER d3dPP
ZeroMemory( &amp;d3dPP, sizeof( d3dPP ) );
d3dPP.Windowed        = FALSE
d3dPP.SwapEffect      = D3DSWAPEFFECT_DISCARD;
d3dPP.MultiSampleType = D3DMULTISAMPLE_2_SAMPLES;
pD3D-&gt;CreateDevice(D3DADAPTER_DEFAULT, D3DDEVTYPE_HAL, hWnd,
                    D3DCREATE_SOFTWARE_VERTEXPROCESSING,
                    &amp;d3dpp, &amp;d3dDevice)
</code></pre>
<p>To use multisampling, the SwapEffect member of D3DPRESENT_PARAMETER must be set to D3DSWAPEFFECT_DISCARD.</p>
<p>The last step is to enable multisampling antialiasing by calling the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-setrenderstate"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::SetRenderState</strong></a> method and setting the D3DRS_MULTISAMPLEANTIALIAS to <strong>TRUE</strong>. After setting this value to <strong>TRUE</strong>, any rendering that you do will have multisampling applied to it. You might want to enable and disable multisampling, depending on what you are rendering.</p>

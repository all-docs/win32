<h1>Rectangles (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Throughout Direct3D and Window programming, objects on the screen are referred to in terms of bounding rectangles. The sides of a bounding rectangle are always parallel to the sides of the screen, so the rectangle can be described by two points, the upper-left corner and lower-right corner. Most applications use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect"><strong>RECT</strong></a> structure to carry information about a bounding rectangle to use when blitting to the screen or performing hit detection.</p>
<p>In C++, the <a href="/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect"><strong>RECT</strong></a> structure has the following definition.</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct tagRECT { 
    LONG    left;    // This is the upper-left corner x-coordinate.
    LONG    top;     // The upper-left corner y-coordinate.
    LONG    right;   // The lower-right corner x-coordinate.
    LONG    bottom;  // The lower-right corner y-coordinate.
} RECT, *PRECT, NEAR *NPRECT, FAR *LPRECT; 
</code></pre>
<p>In the preceding example, the left and top members are the x- and y-coordinates of a bounding rectangle's upper-left corner. Similarly, the right and bottom members make up the coordinates of the lower-right corner. The following illustration shows how you can visualize these values.</p>
<p><img src="images/rect.png" alt="illustration of the rectangle bounded by the left, top, right, and bottom values" /></p>
<p>The column of pixels at the right edge and the row of pixels at the bottom edge are not included in the RECT. For example, locking a RECT with members {10, 10, 138, 138} results in an object 128 pixels in width and height.</p>
<p>In the interest of efficiency, consistency, and ease of use, all Direct3D presentation functions work with rectangles.</p>

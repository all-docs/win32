<h1>Copying Surfaces (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>The term blit is shorthand for &quot;bit block transfer,&quot; which is the process of transferring blocks of data from one place in memory to another. The blitting device driver interface (DDI) continues to be used in Direct3D 9 as the primary mechanism for moving large rectangles of pixels on a per-frame basis, the mechanism behind the copy-oriented <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::Present</strong></a> method. The transportation of artwork in the blit operation is performed by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::UpdateTexture</strong></a> method. Artwork can also be copied in Direct3D 9 by using the <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-updatesurface"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::UpdateSurface</strong></a> method, which copies a rectangular subset of pixels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Direct3D 9 provides D3DX functions that enable you to load artwork from files, apply color conversion, and resize artwork. For more information about the available functions see <a href="dx9-graphics-reference-d3dx-functions-texture.html">Texture Functions in D3DX 9</a>.</p>

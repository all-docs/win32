<h1>Fog State (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Fog effects can give a 3D scene greater realism. You can use fog effects for more than simulating fog. They can also decrease the clarity of a scene with distance. This mirrors what happens in the real world; as objects become more distant from the user, their detail is less distinct.</p>
<p>For more information about using fog in your application, see <a href="fog.html">Fog (Direct3D 9)</a>.</p>
<p>A C++ application controls fog through device rendering states. The <a href="./d3drenderstatetype.html"><strong>D3DRENDERSTATETYPE</strong></a> enumerated type includes states to control whether pixel (table) or vertex fog is used, what color it is, the fog formula the system applies, and the parameters of the formula.</p>
<p>You enable fog by setting the D3DRS_FOGENABLE render state to <strong>TRUE</strong>. The fog color can be set to any color value by using the D3DRS_FOGCOLOR render state; the alpha component of the fog color is ignored.</p>
<p>The D3DRS_FOGTABLEMODE and D3DRS_FOGVERTEXMODE render states control the fog formula applied for fog calculations, and they indirectly control which type of fog is applied. Both render states can be set to a member of the <a href="./d3dfogmode.html"><strong>D3DFOGMODE</strong></a> enumerated type. Setting either render state to D3DFOG_NONE disables pixel or vertex fog, respectively. If both render states are set to valid modes, the system applies only pixel fog effects.</p>
<p>The D3DRS_FOGSTART and D3DRS_FOGEND render states control fog formula parameters for the D3DFOG_LINEAR mode. The D3DRS_FOGDENSITY render state controls fog density in the exponential fog modes.</p>

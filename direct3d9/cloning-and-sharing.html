<h1>Cloning and Sharing (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<h2>Cloning Parameters</h2>
<p>Cloning has the following restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clones inherit the original effect's pool. See the Sharing Parameters section.</li>
<li>Clones inherit the original effect's techniques, passes, parameters, and annotations (including all annotations added with <a href="id3dxeffect.html"><strong>ID3DXEffect</strong></a>).</li>
<li>Clones inherit the original effect's dynamically added annotations.</li>
<li>Cloning onto a new device will fail if the original effect's pool was not <strong>NULL</strong> and the original effect contained a shared device-dependent parameter (such as a texture or shader).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sharing Parameters</h2>
<p>A pool is a buffer that shares effect parameters between different effects. To add parameters to a pool, specify a shared usage when the effect is created.</p>
<p>A pool has the following restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li>A parameter is added to the pool the first time an effect containing that (shared) parameter is added to the pool.</li>
<li>A pool gets initial values from the first shared parameter; parameters shared subsequently get their values from the pool.</li>
<li>A parameter is deleted from the pool when all effect references to the shared parameter are released.</li>
<li>All effects in the pool that contain the same (shared) device-dependent parameter must have the same device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NULL</strong> can be used to specify no pool, in which case no parameters are shared. This is almost equivalent to specifying a unique pool just for this effect. The single difference is that when the effect is cloned, the clone will not share its shared parameters with the original.</p>

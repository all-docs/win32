<h1>Using Geometry Blending (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>The following user-defined structure can be used for vertices that will be blended between two matrices.</p>
<pre><code>// The flexible vertex format (FVF) descriptor for this vertex would be:
//   FVF = D3DFVF_XYZB1 | D3DFVF_NORMAL | D3DFVF_TEX1; 

struct D3DBLENDVERTEX {
    D3DVECTOR v;
    FLOAT     blend; 
    D3DVECTOR n;
    FLOAT     tu, tv;
};
</code></pre>
<p>The blend weight must appear after the position and RHW data in the FVF, and before the vertex normal.</p>
<p>Notice that the preceding vertex format contains only one blending weight value. This is because there will be two world matrices, defined in the <a href="d3dts-worldmatrix.html"><strong>D3DTS_WORLDMATRIX</strong></a>(0) and <strong>D3DTS_WORLDMATRIX</strong>(1) transform states. The system blends each vertex between these two matrices using the single weight value. For three matrices, only two weights are required, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]</p>
<p>Defining skin weights is easy. Using a linear function of the distance between joints is good start, but a smoother sigmoid function looks better. Choosing a skin-weight distribution function can result in sharp creases at joints, if desired, by using a large variation in skin weight over a short distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Setting Blending Matrices</h2>
<p>You set the transformation matrices between which the system blends by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::SetTransform</strong></a> method. Set the first parameter to a value defined by the <a href="d3dts-worldmatrix.html"><strong>D3DTS_WORLDMATRIX</strong></a> macro, and set the second parameter to the address of the matrix to be set.</p>
<p>The following C++ code example sets two world matrices, between which geometry is blended to create the illusion of a jointed arm.</p>
<pre><code>// For this example, the d3dDevice variable is assumed to be a valid pointer
//   to an IDirect3DDevice9 interface for an initialized 3D scene.

float     BendAngle = 3.1415926f / 4.0f; // 45 degrees
D3DMATRIX matUpperArm, matLowerArm;

// The upper arm is immobile. Use the identity matrix.
D3DXMatrixIdentity( matUpperArm );
d3dDevice-&gt;SetTransform( D3DTS_WORLDMATRIX(0), &amp;matUpperArm );

// The lower arm rotates about the x-axis, attached to the upper arm.
D3DXMatrixRotationX( matLowerArm, -BendAngle ); 
d3dDevice-&gt;SetTransform( D3DTS_WORLDMATRIX(1), &amp;matLowerArm );
</code></pre>
<p>Setting a blending matrix merely causes the system to cache the matrix for later use; it doesn't instruct the system to begin blending vertices.</p>
<h2>Enabling Geometry Blending</h2>
<p>Geometry blending is disabled by default. To enable geometry blending, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>IDirect3DDevice9::SetRenderState</strong></a> method to set the D3DRS_VERTEXBLEND render state to a value from the <a href="./d3dvertexblendflags.html"><strong>D3DVERTEXBLENDFLAGS</strong></a> enumerated type. The following code example shows what this call might look like when setting the render state for a blend between two world matrices.</p>
<pre><code>d3dDevice-&gt;SetRenderState( D3DRS_VERTEXBLEND, D3DVBF_1WEIGHTS );
</code></pre>
<p>When D3DRS_VERTEXBLEND is set to any value other than D3DVBF_DISABLE, the system assumes that the appropriate number of blending weights will be included in the vertex format. It is your responsibility to provide a compliant vertex format, and to provide a proper description of that format to the Direct3D rendering methods.</p>
<p>When enabled, the system performs geometry blending for all objects rendered by the DrawPrimitive rendering methods.</p>

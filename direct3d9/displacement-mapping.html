<h1>Displacement Mapping (Direct3D 9)</h1>
<p>Displacement maps are similar to texture maps but are accessed by the vertex engine.</p>
<h2>Block Diagram</h2>
<p>An additional sampler stage is present in the early part of the vertex pipe, as shown in the following diagram, which can sample a displacement map to provide vertex displacement data.</p>
<p><img src="images/tessellatordx9.png" alt="diagram of the sampler stage in the vertex pipe" /></p>
<p>The displacement map sampler state can be set by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api"><strong>SetSamplerState</strong></a> using stage number 256, which is a new stage number. The displacement map texture is set by <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-settexture"><strong>SetTexture</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The map can be presampled or not, which means that it can be ordered in a way that enables the lookup of the displacement values without filtering.</p>
<ul>
<li>Displacement maps are analogous to texture maps but are accessed by the vertex engine.</li>
<li>An additional sampler stage is present in the early part of the vertex pipe that can sample a displacement map. This stage is accessed by the usual SetSamplerState API but the stage number is D3DDMAPSAMPLER = 256.</li>
<li>The displacement map sampler state can be set by the SetSamplerState(D3DDMAPSAMPLER, ...) API.</li>
<li>The displacement map texture is set by the SetTexture(D3DDMAPSAMPLER, texture) API.</li>
<li>The map can be pre-sampled or not. This means that it can be ordered in a particular way that enables the lookup of the displacement values without filtering.</li>
<li>The changes in the declaration structure allow the specification of the texture coordinate used to look up the texture map. For example, Stream0, Offset, FLOAT2, LOOKUP, Displacement_value. This tells the tessellator to use the 2D float vector in stream0 at a certain offset as a texture coordinate to look up the displacement map and associate the Displacement_value usage semantic to it. The vertex shader declaration would contain a line similar to {dcl_texture0, v0} indicating that the texture0 semantic is to be associated with the v0 input register. The displacement value looked up is copied into input register v0.</li>
<li>There is a special type of displacement mapping, when the texture map is pre-sampled. Sequential index of generated vertices is used as a texture coordinate to a texture map. For example, 0,0,(D3DDECLTYPE)0,D3DDECLMETHOD_LOOKUPPRESAMPLED, Usage, UsageIndex.</li>
<li>The output of the lookup is 4 floats.</li>
<li>Displacement mapping is supported only with N-patches.</li>
<li>Drivers need to ignore D3DDMAPSAMPLER in SetTextureStageState if they do not handle displacement maps.</li>
<li>D3DTEXF_ANISOTROPIC filter mode is not supported.</li>
<li>When D3DSAMP_MIPFILTER in the displacement map sampler is not D3DTEXF_NONE, the level of detail is computed as follows (Note that the adaptive tessellation state is used even if the D3DRS_ENABLEADAPTIVETESSELLATION is <strong>FALSE</strong>): Tmax = render state D3DRS_MAXTESSELLATIONLEVEL</li>
<li>Compute tessellation level Te for a vertex Vi: (Xi, Yi, Zi) the same way as described in the &quot;Adaptive tessellation&quot; section. Level of detail L = log2(Tmax) - log2 (Te).</li>
<li>Texture filtering and sampling operations follow the same rules as the pixel pipeline (level of detail (LOD) bias is applied, etc.).</li>
<li>Not all formats can be used as displacement maps but only those that support the D3DUSAGE_DMAP. The application can query that with the CheckDeviceFormat <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-checkdeviceformat"><strong>CheckDeviceFormat</strong></a>.</li>
<li>D3DUSAGE_DMAP must be specified in <a href="/windows/win32/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-createtexture"><strong>CreateTexture</strong></a> to notify the driver that this texture is to be used as a displacement map.</li>
<li>D3DUSAGE_DMAP can only be used with textures. It cannot be used with cube maps or volumes.</li>
<li>Textures and render targets created with D3DUSAGE_DMAP can be set at regular sampler stages and as render targets.</li>
<li>The render states to set the wrap mode for the texture coordinates are ignored in displacement mapping. In general, there are no wrap modes for the tessellator engine.</li>
<li>A displacement map sampler has behavior identical to that of the pixel texture samplers. If a texture with less than four channels (like R32f) is looked up, the looked-up values go to the appropriate channels of the destination register (the vertex shader input register tagged with the _sample semantic), while the other channels default to (1, 1, 1). When looked up, D3DFMT_L8 gets broadcast into the R, G, B channels and A defaults to 1. The reference rasterizer has the full implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pre-Sampled Displacement Mapping</h2>
<ul>
<li>New sampler state is introduced: D3DSAMP_DMAPOFFSET (DWORD) - offset (in vertices) in a pre-sampled displacement map.</li>
<li>New declaration method is introduced: D3DDECLMETHOD_LOOKUPPRESAMPLED.</li>
<li>Adaptive tessellation should be disabled.</li>
<li>Texture filter settings are ignored. Point sampling is done. The mip texture filter is assumed to be D3DTEXF_NONE. All other texture filter modes are assumed to be D3DTEXF_POINT.</li>
<li>Texture coordinates are computed as: U = (Index % TextureWidthInPixeles) / (float)(TextureWidthInPixeles) V = (Index / TextureWidthInPixeles) / (float)(TextureHeightInPixeles) where Index is a sequential index of generated vertices plus TSS[D3DSAMP_DMAPOFFSET]. The sequential index is set to zero at the start of each primitive and is increased after a vertex is generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the API changes that support displacement mapping.</p>
<ul>
<li>A single channel format added, D3DFMT_L16.</li>
<li>A new usage flag, D3DUSAGE_DMAP.</li>
<li>A special texture stage, used to set a displacement map texture, D3DDMAPSAMPLER.</li>
<li>New hardware caps have been added, D3DDEVCAPS2_DMAPNPATCH and D3DDEVCAPS2_PRESAMPLEDDMAPNPATCH. See <a href="d3ddevcaps2.html">D3DDEVCAPS2</a>.</li>

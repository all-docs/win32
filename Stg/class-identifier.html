<h1>Class Identifier</h1>
<p>The class identifier (CLSID) is that of a class that can display and/or provide programmatic access to the property values. If there is no such class, it is recommended that you set this value the same as the FMTID (see below). Alternatively, you can set this value to all zeroes; however, using the FMTID allows more flexibility in the future.</p>

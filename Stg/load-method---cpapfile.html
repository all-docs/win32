<h1>Load Method - CPapFile</h1>
<p>When these operations are successful, the obtained <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nn-objidl-istorage"><strong>IStorage</strong></a> interface is released. This closes the file and indicates that the file is not held open during other client operations. It will be reopened when required.</p>
<p>This example is the <strong>CPapFile</strong>Â <strong>Load</strong> method from Papfile.cpp.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT CPapFile::Load(
                      SHORT nLockKey,
                      TCHAR* pszFileName)
  {
    HRESULT hr = E_FAIL;
    BOOL bNewFile = (NULL != pszFileName);
    TCHAR* pszFile;

    // If null file name passed then use current file name.
    pszFile = bNewFile ? pszFileName : m_szCurFileName;

    // Verify that the file is using the APPUTIL function.
    if (FileExist(pszFile))
    {
      // Use the COM service to verify that the file is actually a 
      // valid compound file.
      hr = StgIsStorageFile(pszFile);
      if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      {
        // Use the COM service to open the compound file and
        // obtain an IStorage interface.
        hr = StgOpenStorage(
               pszFile,
               NULL,
               STGM_DIRECT | STGM_READ | STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE,
               NULL,
               0,
               &amp;m_pIStorage);
        if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
        {
          // An IStorage interface has been obtained. Now, request 
          // the COPaper object on the server side to load into  
          // itself the file's paper data using IStorage for our 
          // client-provided compound file.
          hr = m_pIPaper-&gt;Load(nLockKey, m_pIStorage);
          if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
          {
            // The paper data was loaded and a current compound
            // file name exists. Copy it for later use in a saves 
            // and loads.
            if (bNewFile)
              StringCchCopy(m_szCurFileName, sizeof(m_szCurFileName), pszFileName);
          }

          // The Storage object is not required now. Do not hold the 
          // file open. Re-obtain the IStorage again later, when 
          // required (and thus re-open the compound file) for
          // another save or load.
          RELEASE_INTERFACE(m_pIStorage);
        }
      }
    }

    return (hr);
  }

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>As with the <a href="save-method---cpapfile.html"><strong>Save</strong></a> method, if <strong>NULL</strong> is passed for the <em>pszFileName</em> parameter, the stored content of member <strong>m_szCurFileName</strong> is used for the file name. Because an existing file may be opened, the APPUTIL <strong>FileExist</strong> function is first used to verify that the file exists. If it exists, the standard <a href="/windows/desktop/api/coml2api/nf-coml2api-stgisstoragefile"><strong>StgIsStorageFile</strong></a> service function is called to verify the format of the file to determine if it is a valid compound file.</p>
<p>If the file is valid, the standard <a href="/windows/desktop/api/coml2api/nf-coml2api-stgopenstorage"><strong>StgOpenStorage</strong></a> service function is called to open the file and return a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nn-objidl-istorage"><strong>IStorage</strong></a> interface for it.</p>
<p>The first parameter is the name of the compound file to open. As with the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/coml2api/nf-coml2api-stgcreatedocfile"><strong>StgCreateDocfile</strong></a> call, this string is expected in the Unicode form, and during ANSI compilation an APPUTIL macro is used to ensure the ANSI parameter is converted to the expected Unicode.</p>
<p>The second priority storage parameter is <strong>NULL</strong>, indicating it is not used in this sample.</p>
<p>The access mode flags are passed as the third parameter to specify what access modes are permitted on the opened file. <a href="stgm-constants.html"><strong>STGM_READ</strong></a> opens the file with read-only permission. <a href="stgm-constants.html"><strong>STGM_DIRECT</strong></a> opens the file for direct access, as opposed to transacted access. <a href="stgm-constants.html"><strong>STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE</strong></a> opens the file for exclusive, non-shared use by the caller.</p>
<p>The fourth element exclusion parameter in <strong>NULL</strong>, indicating it is not used in this sample.</p>
<p>The fifth parameter is reserved for future use and must be zero.</p>
<p>The address of pointer variable <strong>m_pIStorage</strong> is passed as the sixth parameter. When the call successfully returns, <strong>m_pIStorage</strong> contains a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nn-objidl-istorage"><strong>IStorage</strong></a> interface. This is the interface that is used for any subsequent operations on the opened file.</p>
<p>The important operation in this case is to have the COPaper object load its drawing data from the file. This is done above using the <strong>Load</strong> method of COPaper's <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper</strong></a> interface. If COPaper succeeds in loading its data using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nn-objidl-istorage"><strong>IStorage</strong></a> provided, the name of the compound file is copied into <strong>m_szCurFileName</strong> as the new current file name.</p>
<p>When these operations are successfully completed, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nn-objidl-istorage"><strong>IStorage</strong></a> interface that was obtained is released. This closes the file and means that the file is not held open during other client operations. It will be reopened when required.</p>

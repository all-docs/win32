<h1>Save Method - CPapFile</h1>
<p>When <strong>CPapFile</strong> is initialized, it can be used to save the current drawing data held in the COPaper object.</p>
<h2>Save Method (PAPFILE.CPP)</h2>
<p>This example is the <strong>CPapFile</strong>Â <a href="ipaper--save.html"><strong>Save</strong></a> method from Papfile.cpp.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT CPapFile::Save(
                      SHORT nLockKey,
                      TCHAR* pszFileName)
  {
    HRESULT hr = E_FAIL;
    BOOL bNewFile = (NULL != pszFileName);
    TCHAR* pszFile;

    // If a null file name is passed, then use current file name.
    pszFile = bNewFile ? pszFileName : m_szCurFileName;

    // Use the COM service to reopen, or create, the compound file.
    hr = StgCreateDocfile(
        pszFile,
    STGM_CREATE | STGM_DIRECT | STGM_READWRITE | STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE,
        0,
        &amp;m_pIStorage);
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
      // Obtained the IStorage. The compound file is open.
      // Instruct the COPaper object on the server side to save its
      // paper data into the compound file using the IStorage of our
      // client-provided compound file.
      hr = m_pIPaper-&gt;Save(nLockKey, m_pIStorage);
      if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
      {
        // The paper data was saved and obtained a new current 
        // compound file name. Copy it for later use in saves 
        // and loads.
        if (bNewFile)
          StringCchCopy(m_szCurFileName, sizeof(m_szCurFileName), pszFileName);
      }

      // Storage complete. Do not hold the file open.
      // Re-obtain the IStorage again later (and thus re-open
      // the compound file) when required for another save or load.
      RELEASE_INTERFACE(m_pIStorage);
    }

    return (hr);
  }
  
</code></pre>
<p>If <strong>NULL</strong> is passed for the <em>pszFileName</em> parameter, the stored content of member <strong>m_szCurFileName</strong> is used for the file name. The <em>nLockKey</em> is the client lock key obtained in a previous call to the COPaper <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>Lock</strong></a> method in the <strong>IPaper</strong> interface.</p>
<p>The COM standard <a href="/windows/desktop/api/coml2api/nf-coml2api-stgcreatedocfile"><strong>StgCreateDocfile</strong></a> service function is called to create the compound file in which the drawing data will be saved.</p>
<p>The name of the compound file to create is passed as the first parameter. This is expected by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/coml2api/nf-coml2api-stgcreatedocfile"><strong>StgCreateDocfile</strong></a> as a Unicode string. When <strong>StoClien</strong> is compiled for ANSI strings (UNICODE is not defined, which is the default in the makefile), this call actually reduces to a call to an internal APPUTIL function, <strong>A_StgCreateDocfile</strong>. This function performs the proper conversion of the ANSI pszFile parameter to a Unicode version before calling <strong>StgCreateDocfile</strong>. For more information, see Apputil.h and Stoserve.htm.</p>
<p>The access mode flags are passed as the second parameter and determine which access modes are permitted on the new file. The <a href="stgm-constants.html">STGM_CREATE</a> access mode flag creates a new compound file or overwrites an existing one of the same name. <a href="stgm-constants.html">STGM_READWRITE</a> opens the file with read-write permission. <a href="stgm-constants.html">STGM_DIRECT</a> opens the file for direct access, as opposed to transacted access. <a href="stgm-constants.html">STGM_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE</a> opens the file for exclusive, non-shared use by the caller.</p>
<p>The third parameter is reserved and must be zero.</p>
<p>The address of pointer variable <strong>m_pIStorage</strong> is passed to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/coml2api/nf-coml2api-stgcreatedocfile"><strong>StgCreateDocfile</strong></a> as the fourth parameter. When the call successfully returns, <strong>m_pIStorage</strong> contains an interface pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nn-objidl-istorage"><strong>IStorage</strong></a> interface. This is the interface that is used for any subsequent operations on the file.</p>
<p>The important operation in this case is to have the COPaper object store its drawing data in the file. This is done above using the <a href="ipaper--save.html"><strong>Save</strong></a> method of the COPaper <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper</strong></a> interface. If COPaper succeeds in saving its data in the storage object provided, the name of the compound file is copied into <strong>m_szCurFileName</strong> as the new current file name.</p>

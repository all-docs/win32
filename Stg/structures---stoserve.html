<h1>Structures - StoServe</h1>
<p>COPaper packages the pen color, width, and coordinates into <strong>INKDATA</strong> structures and stores them in a dynamically allocated array that it manages in memory.</p>
<h2>INKDATA Structure</h2>
<p>The following are the declarations for the <strong>INKDATA</strong> structure from PAPER.H.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>// The types of Ink Data.
#define INKTYPE_NONE  0
#define INKTYPE_START 1
#define INKTYPE_DRAW  2
#define INKTYPE_STOP  3

  // The Ink Data structure.
  typedef struct _INKDATA
  {
    SHORT nType;            // Ink Type.
    SHORT nX;               // X-coordinate of ink point.
    SHORT nY;               // Y-coordinate of ink point.
    SHORT nWidth;           // Ink line width in pixels.
    COLORREF crColor;       // Ink color.
  } INKDATA;
</code></pre>
<p>The dynamic array of these <strong>INKDATA</strong> packets is pointed to by m_paInkData, a member of the <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper</strong></a> implementation class. The array is created within the <strong>IPaper::InitPaper</strong> method with an initial allocation. For details, see the <strong>InitPaper</strong> method and the private NextSlot utility method of the CImpIPaper implementation in PAPER.H. The <a href="inkstart-method.html"><strong>InkStart</strong></a>, <a href="inkdraw-method.html"><strong>InkDraw</strong></a>, and <a href="cguipaper-methods.html"><strong>InkStop</strong></a> methods use NextSlot to obtain new slots in the array. The array is expanded dynamically by NextSlot as the need arises.</p>
<p>The client calls the <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper::Erase</strong></a> method to erase the current drawing. This method does not reallocate the array; it simply marks all current ink data as INKTYPE_NONE and resets the array's end-of-data index to zero.</p>
<p>The client calls the <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper::Lock</strong></a> and <strong>Unlock</strong> methods to manage ownership of COPaper for drawing. These methods are provided to organize access among multiple clients to the drawing held in a shared COPaper.</p>
<h2>PAPER_PROPERTIES Structure</h2>
<p>The client calls the <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper::Resize</strong></a> method to tell COPaper that the user resized the current drawing paper rectangle. This coordinate data is kept in a <strong>PAPER_PROPERTIES</strong> structure, which is stored with the ink data when all the paper data is stored in a compound file.</p>
<p>The following is the <strong>PAPER_PROPERTIES</strong> declaration from PAPER.H.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#define PAPER_TITLE_SIZE 64
  typedef struct _PAPER_PROPERTIES
  {
    LONG lInkDataVersion;
    LONG lInkArraySize;
    COLORREF crWinColor;
    RECT WinRect;
    WCHAR wszTitle[PAPER_TITLE_SIZE];
    WCHAR wszAuthor[PAPER_TITLE_SIZE];
    WCHAR wszReserved1[PAPER_TITLE_SIZE];
    WCHAR wszReserved2[PAPER_TITLE_SIZE];
  } PAPER_PROPERTIES;
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>PAPER_PROPERTIES</strong> structure is designed so that new ink data formats can be added at any time as the DllPaper component evolves. The <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper</strong></a> interface is general enough that a subsequent version of the DllPaper component may store a different ink data format while implementing the same <strong>IPaper</strong> interface. Because the methods of <strong>IPaper</strong> do not depend on a specific ink data format, a new version of the DllPaper component that does support a different ink data format can use this same interface.</p>
<p>The paper properties stored in a compound file record the current size of the ink data array. The proper array size can then be allocated to accommodate the ink data read from the file.</p>
<p>The <strong>PAPER_PROPERTIES</strong> structure also stores the paper surface's drawing rectangle size and background window color.</p>
<p>Though not used in the <strong>StoServe</strong>/<strong>StoClien</strong> samples, a drawing title and an author name can also be stored.</p>
<p>Creation date and last modified dates are not included in these paper properties, because the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nn-objidl-istorage"><strong>IStorage</strong></a> interface used to access compound files manages this information.</p>

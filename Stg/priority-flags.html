<h1>Priority Flags</h1>
<p>The priority flag opens a storage object in priority mode. When it opens an object, an application usually works from a snapshot copy because other applications may also be using the object at the same time. When opening a storage object in priority mode, however, the application has exclusive rights to commit changes to the object.</p>
<p>Priority mode enables an application to read some streams from storage before opening the object in a mode that would require the system to make a snapshot copy. Because the application has exclusive access, it does not have to make a snapshot copy of the object. When the application subsequently opens the object in a mode where a snapshot copy is required, the application can exclude the streams it has already read from the snapshot, thereby reducing the overhead of opening the object.</p>
<p>Because other applications cannot commit changes to an object while it is open in priority mode, applications should keep the object in that mode for as short a time as possible.</p>

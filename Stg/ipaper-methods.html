<h1>IPaper Methods</h1>
<p><strong>StoServe</strong>provides COPaper objects that are controlled primarily by their native <strong>IPaper</strong> interface.</p>

<p>Methods of interest for this code sample on compound files are <a href="ipaper--load.html"><strong>Load</strong></a>, <a href="ipaper--save.html"><strong>Save</strong></a>, and <a href="ipaper--redraw.html"><strong>Redraw</strong></a>.</p>
<p><a href="inkstart-method.html"><strong>InkStart</strong></a>, <a href="inkdraw-method.html"><strong>InkDraw</strong></a>, and <a href="cguipaper-methods.html"><strong>InkStop</strong></a> are methods used by clients to command COPaper to record ink drawing sequences. The client will typically respond to a WM_LBUTTONDOWN message as the start of an ink drawing sequence by calling <strong>InkStart</strong> on COPaper. As the user moves the mouse or pen to draw while holding down the left button, the client will respond to repeated WM_MOUSEMOVE messages with corresponding calls to <strong>InkDraw</strong>. When the user releases the left mouse button, the client will respond to a WM_LBUTTONUP message with a call to <strong>InkStop</strong>, which marks the end of the ink drawing sequence.</p>
<p><a href="inkstart-method.html"><strong>InkStart</strong></a> tells COPaper the start position for the drawing sequence in client window coordinates. It also passes the currently selected ink color and width. The client maintains these selections; COPaper merely records them when the <strong>InkStart</strong> call is made. <a href="inkdraw-method.html"><strong>InkDraw</strong></a> is called repeatedly to tell COPaper the succession of window coordinates that represent the drawing motion of the mouse or pen. <a href="cguipaper-methods.html"><strong>InkStop</strong></a> instructs COPaper to mark the end of a drawing sequence.</p>

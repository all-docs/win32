<h1>Format Version</h1>
<p>The Format Version value is a <strong>WORD</strong> data type that is used to indicate the format version of this stream. It may be zero or one. The format-version indicator should be checked when reading the property set. If it is not zero or one, then the stream was written to a different specification and cannot be read by code developed according to this specification.</p>
<p>Property sets with Format Version 1 are equivalent to Version 0, with the following additions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case sensitive property names</strong>. Property names are stored in the reserved dictionary property, <a href="/windows/desktop/Stg/reserved-property-identifiers">Property ID 0</a>. In version 1 property sets, these names can be case sensitive. Case sensitivity is determined by the reserved Behavior property, <a href="/windows/desktop/Stg/reserved-property-identifiers">Property ID 0x80000003</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Long property names</strong>. Version 1 property sets, unlike version 0 property sets, are not limited in the length of property names. See <a href="/windows/desktop/Stg/reserved-property-identifiers">Property ID 0</a> for more information on property names.</li>
<li><strong>Property types</strong>. Version 1 property sets can hold all the property types that can be held in a version 0 property set plus some additional types. See the <a href="/windows/win32/api/propidlbase/ns-propidlbase-propvariant"><strong>PROPVARIANT</strong></a> structure for more information on these types.</li>
</ul>

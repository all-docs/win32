<h1>Type Indicators</h1>
<p>The actual properties follow the table of Property Identifiers/Offset Pairs property set values. Each property is stored as a <strong>DWORD</strong>, followed by the data type value.</p>
<p>Type indicators and their associated values are described in the <a href="/windows/win32/api/propidlbase/ns-propidlbase-propvariant"><strong>PROPVARIANT</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>All Type/Value pairs must begin on a 32-bit boundary. Thus, values may be followed with null bytes to align the subsequent pair on a 32-bit boundary.</p>
<p>The following example code calculates how many bytes are required to align on a 32-bit boundary, given a count of bytes.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>cbAdd = (((cbCurrent + 3) &gt;&gt; 2) &lt;&lt; 2) - cbCurrent ;
</code></pre>
<p>Within a vector of values, each repetition of a simple scalar value smaller than 32 bits must align with its natural alignment rather than with a 32-bit alignment. In practice, this is only significant for types <strong>VT_UI1</strong>, <strong>VT_UI2</strong>, <strong>VT_I2</strong>, and <strong>VT_BOOL</strong> (which have one-byte or two-byte natural alignment). All other types have four-byte natural alignment. Some types, for example, <strong>VT_R8</strong>, actually have 8-byte natural alignment, but are stored as if they have four-byte alignment.</p>
<p>A property value with type indicator <strong>VT_I2</strong> | <strong>VT_VECTOR</strong> would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>DWORD</strong> element count.</li>
<li>A sequence of packed two-byte integers with no null padding between them.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
Any 32-bit counts or property types that are stored as a part of a vector property element must also be 32-bit aligned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>A property value of type identifier <strong>VT_LPSTR</strong> | <strong>VT_VECTOR</strong> would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>DWORD</strong> element count (<strong>DWORD</strong>Â <em>cElems</em>).</li>
<li>A sequence of strings (<strong>char</strong>Â <em>rgch[]</em>), each preceded by a length-count <strong>DWORD</strong> and possibly followed by null padding to round to a 32-bit boundary.</li>
</ul>

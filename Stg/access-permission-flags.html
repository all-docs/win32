<h1>Access Permission Flags</h1>
<p>Access permission flags specify the type of access a client application has to an open object: read, write, or read/write. Read permission enables an application to read the contents of a stream but not to write changes to the stream. Write permission enables an application to call a function that commits changes to an object's storage but not to read the contents of the stream. Read/write permission enables an application to either read the object's streams or write to the object's storage.</p>

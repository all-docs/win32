<h1>Structured Storage</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Structured Storage provides file and data persistence in COM by handling a single file as a structured collection of objects known as storages and streams.</p>
<p>The purpose of Structured Storage is to reduce the performance penalties and overhead associated with storing separate objects in a single file. Structured Storage provides a solution by defining how to handle a single file entity as a structured collection of two types of objects storages and streams through a standard implementation called Compound Files. This enables the user to interact with, and manage, a compound file as if it were a single file rather than a nested hierarchy of separate objects.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>Structured Storage can be used on Microsoft COM-based operating systems.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>The Structured Storage documentation is intended for experienced C and C++ programmers and COM-based system developers.</p>
<p>Structured Storage primarily supports C and C++ programming languages, however any COM-based technology will also support any programming language that utilizes interface pointers.</p>
<p>A solid understanding of COM technologies is prerequisite to the developmental use of Structured Storage.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>For more information about which operating systems are required to use a particular API element, see the Requirements section of the documentation for the element.</p>

<h1>Property Set Considerations</h1>
<p>It is strongly recommended that property sets be kept small because the property set stream is read into memory before a single property can be read or written. &quot;small&quot; means less than 32 kilobytes of data. This rarely presents a problem because typically, &quot;in-line&quot; properties will be small items such as descriptive strings, keywords, time stamps, counts, author names, globally unique identifiers (GUIDs), class identifiers (CLSIDs), and so forth.</p>
<p>To store larger chunks of data, or in cases where the total size of a set of related properties far exceeds the recommended amount, the use of nonsimple types such as <strong>VT_STREAM</strong> and <strong>VT_STORAGE</strong> are strongly recommended. These are not stored within the property set stream, so they do not significantly affect the initial overhead of the first accessing and writing of a property. There is a minimal overhead as the property set stream contains the name of the sibling stream- or storage-valued property and this takes an additional small amount of time to process.</p>

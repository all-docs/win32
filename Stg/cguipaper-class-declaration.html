<p><strong>CGuiPaper</strong> maintains the current GUI properties for the drawing paper. Members <strong>m_crInkColor</strong>, <strong>m_crInkWidth</strong>, and <strong>m_WinRect</strong> contain values for the current ink color, ink width, and drawing rectangle. The <strong>m_hWnd</strong> member stores the handle to the window where painting is done.</p>
<p>The actual painting of images is done using a handle to a device context held in member <strong>m_hDC</strong>. A handle to the current drawing pen is kept in member <strong>m_hPen</strong>. The pen is destroyed and recreated when its color or width is changed by the user.</p>
<p>Members <strong>m_pCOPaperSink</strong> and <strong>m_dwPaperSink</strong> hold values necessary for connecting with COPaper to receive incoming notifications through the <a href="ipapersink-methods.html"><strong>IPaperSink</strong></a> interface. Member <strong>m_bDirty</strong> holds a flag indicating that the user has changed the drawing and that it no longer reflects the data stored in its file.</p>
<p>Member <strong>m_pIPaper</strong> holds the main interface pointer to the COPaper object. All of the COPaper functionality is accessed through this pointer.</p>
<p>The <strong>m_nLockKey</strong> member is used to support a client locking scheme that is used with multiple clients to allow a client exclusive access to a shared COPaper object. COPaper assigns <strong>m_nLockKey</strong> during an <a href="ipaper-methods.html"><strong>IPaper</strong></a>::<strong>Lock</strong> call and is passed as a parameter by the client in subsequent calls to COPaper. COPaper will perform the work in those calls only if the lock key that is passed matches the key last handed out to a client by COPaper.</p>
<p>Member <strong>m_pPapFile</strong> holds a pointer to a <a href="cpapfile-class-and-methods.html"><strong>CPapFile</strong></a> object. It is a C++ object that encapsulates load and save operations on a structured storage compound file. <strong>CPapFile</strong> works with the underlying server-based COPaper object to load and save the COPaper drawing data.</p>

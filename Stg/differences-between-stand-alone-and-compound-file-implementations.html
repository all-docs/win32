<h1>Differences between Stand-alone and Compound File Implementations</h1>
<p>The stand-alone implementation of the property set interfaces and the compound file implementation differ in some ways. In the compound-file implementation of stream, storage, property set storage, and property storage objects, the various interfaces coordinate with each another because they share a common implementation. In the stand-alone implementation, the interface implementations are distinct.</p>
<p>As a result, the compound-file implementation handles concurrency issues and synchronizes the property set object with the storage or stream object. With the stand-alone implementation, the client is responsible for handling concurrency and synchronization issues between the storage or stream object and the property set. A client can meet these requirements by following two simple rules. First, never manipulate a property set using its stream or storage interfaces while a property storage object is open on it. Second, always call <strong>Commit</strong> on a property storage object before calling <strong>CopyTo</strong>, <strong>MoveElementTo</strong>, or <strong>Commit</strong> on an ancestor storage object. Specifically, the following items require client attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the compound-file implementation, a single mechanism provides concurrency protection for the storage object and its associated property set objects. However, in the stand-alone implementation, the storage object implementation is separate from the property set implementation and each provides its own concurrency mechanisms. Thus, in the stand-alone implementation, the client is responsible for maintaining concurrency protection between the two implementations through a mechanism of mutual exclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the compound file implementation, changes to property sets are buffered in a property-set cache. Then, when the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nf-objidl-istorage-commit"><strong>IStorage::Commit</strong></a> method is called on the storage object, the compound files implementation automatically flushes the property-set changes from the property-set buffer before the storage object is committed. Thus, the property-set changes are made visible as part of the transaction being committed.</p>
<p>In the stand-alone implementation, the client must explicitly flush the property-set buffer by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Propidl/nf-propidl-ipropertystorage-commit"><strong>IPropertyStorage::Commit</strong></a> before calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nf-objidl-istorage-commit"><strong>IStorage::Commit</strong></a> method on the storage. Alternatively, the client can use the new PROPSETFLAG_UNBUFFERED value in the stand-alone implementation to write directly to the property set instead of caching changes to the property set's internal buffer. If PROPSETFLAG_UNBUFFERED is used, the client's responsibilities are automatically met. The compound file implementation does not support the PROPSETFLAG_UNBUFFERED value. For more information, see <a href="propsetflag-constants.html"><strong>PROPSETFLAG Constants</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As with transacted storages, the compound file implementation updates the property set by flushing its internal buffer before executing a call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nf-objidl-istorage-copyto"><strong>IStorage::CopyTo</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nf-objidl-istorage-moveelementto"><strong>IStorage::MoveElementTo</strong></a>. Thus, changes to the property set are reflected in the copied or moved storage element.</p>
<p>In the stand-alone implementation, the client must explicitly flush the property set buffer by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Propidl/nf-propidl-ipropertystorage-commit"><strong>IPropertyStorage::Commit</strong></a> before calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nf-objidl-istorage-copyto"><strong>IStorage::CopyTo</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Objidl/nf-objidl-istorage-moveelementto"><strong>IStorage::MoveElementTo</strong></a>. Alternatively, the client can use the new PROPSETFLAG_UNBUFFERED value to write directly to the property set instead of caching changes to the property set buffer.

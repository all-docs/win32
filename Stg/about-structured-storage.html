<h1>About Structured Storage</h1>
<p>Traditional file systems encounter challenges when they attempt to store efficiently multiple kinds of objects in one document. COM provides a solution: a file system within a file. COM structured storage defines how to treat a single file entity as a structured collection of two types of objectsâ€”storages and streamsâ€”that perform like directories and files. This scheme is called <em>structured storage</em>. The purpose of structured storage is to reduce the performance penalties and overhead associated with storing separate objects in a flat file.</p>
<p>This section contains an overview of structured storage benefits and fundamentals, property sets and asynchronous structured storage as well as a historical look at file systems:</p>

<p>The <strong>Init</strong> method creates the server-based COPaper object and assigns CGuiPaper's m_pIPaper member.</p>
<p>The <strong>AskSave</strong>, <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>SaveAs</strong>, and <strong>PickColor</strong> methods provide familiar GUI behavior using Win32 common dialogs. For example, the <strong>Open</strong> method uses the Win32 Open File Name dialog box to ask the user to specify a file name for opening.</p>
<p>The <strong>Load</strong> and <strong>Save</strong> methods will be covered in detail later in this tour.</p>
<p><strong>InkSaving</strong>, <strong>InkStart</strong>, <strong>InkDraw</strong>, and <strong>InkStop</strong> are the central methods for the drawing functionality of the <strong>StoClien</strong> application. <strong>StoClien</strong> uses these CGuiPaper methods to capture, display, and store the interactive drawing data as it occurs under user control. They perform a dual role of painting the drawn image to the client window as well as passing the drawing data to COPaper in the server. COPaper translates the drawing data into ink data packets for storage.</p>

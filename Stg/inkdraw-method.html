<h1>InkDraw Method</h1>
<p>CGuiPaper also keeps an m_bInking flag. <a href="inkstart-method.html">InkStart</a> sets it to <strong>TRUE</strong> to signal that a drawing sequence is in process. For example, the InkDraw method uses this flag to determine whether it should paint and save ink data.</p>
<p>The following is the InkDraw method from GUIPAPER.CPP.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>HRESULT CGuiPaper::InkDraw(
                       SHORT nX,
                       SHORT nY)
  {
    if (m_bInking)
    {
      // Start this ink line at previous old position.
      MoveToEx(m_hDC, m_OldPos.x, m_OldPos.y, NULL);

      // Assign new old position and draw the new line.
      LineTo(m_hDC, m_OldPos.x = nX, m_OldPos.y = nY);

      // Ask the Paper object to save this data.
      if (m_bInkSaving)
        m_pIPaper-&gt;InkDraw(m_nLockKey, nX, nY);
    }

    return NOERROR;
  }
</code></pre>
<p>This method does nothing if m_bInking is <strong>FALSE</strong>. This is the condition when the user is simply moving the mouse over the client window without pressing the left mouse button.</p>
<p>InkDraw clearly has a dual responsibility. The Win32 MoveToEx and LineTo calls are made to draw line images on the GUI screen (using the device context handle kept in m_hDC). The ink data is also passed to the COPaper object for recording using the <a href="ipaper-methods.html">IPaper</a> interface's InkDraw method. When m_bInkSaving is <strong>FALSE</strong>, InkDraw paints the line image but does not store the data in COPaper. This condition is used during repainting.</p>

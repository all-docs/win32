<h1>About Windows Networking</h1>
<p>Applications can use the WNet functions to add and cancel network connections and to retrieve information about the current configuration of the network.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the structure of a typical network.</p>
<p><img src="images/csnet-01.png" alt="typical network structure" /></p>
<p>In the preceding figure, the hierarchy for WindowsÂ NT Server/WindowsÂ 2000 Server resources is given in detail as Network provider #1. Network resources from other providers have different hierarchical systems. An application does not need information about the hierarchy before it begins to work with a network. It can proceed from the network root (that is, the topmost container resource) and retrieve information about the network's resources as the information is required.</p>
<p>Network resources that contain other resources are called <em>containers</em>. Container resources are in boxes in the preceding figure.</p>
<p>Resources that do not contain other resources are called <em>objects</em>. In the preceding figure, Sharepoint #1 and Sharepoint #2 are objects. A <em>sharepoint</em> is an object that is accessible across the network. Examples of sharepoints include printers and shared directories.</p>

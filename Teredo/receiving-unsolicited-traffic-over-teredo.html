<h1>Receiving Unsolicited Traffic Over Teredo</h1>
<p><a href="about-teredo.html">Teredo</a> provides global connectivity using IPv6 and NAT traversal capabilities. However, many applications, including peer-to-peer, will require Teredo to receive unsolicited traffic from the Internet. An application can be programmed to receive traffic over a single IPv6 interface or all IPv6-capable interfaces. This documentation describes the requirements for applications that use the Teredo interface to receive unsolicited IPv6 traffic.</p>
<p>An application will receive unsolicited traffic over the Teredo interface only if the application is registered with <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ics/windows-firewall-start-page">Windows Firewall</a>. In order to receive unsolicited traffic the following must occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users must be instructed to use of the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to enable the &quot;Edge Traversal&quot; option for an application. This option is available under Windows Firewall Snap-In --&gt; &lt;application name&gt; --&gt; &quot;Advanced&quot; tab. The &quot;Edge Traversal&quot; option must be enabled individually for each application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;Edge Traversal&quot; option is enabled by the application. It is possible for applications capable of receiving unsolicited traffic to register with Windows Firewall for &quot;Edge Traversal&quot; and receive unsolicited traffic over the Teredo interface. To do this an application must call the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/netfw/nn-netfw-inetfwpolicy2"><strong>INetFwPolicy2</strong></a> API with the &quot;Edge Traversal&quot; option set to VARIANT_TRUE. User consent is required for this API call before an application is permitted to listen for the traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application sets the Winsock <a href="/windows/desktop/WinSock/ipv6-protection-level">IPV6_PROTECTION_LEVEL</a> socket option to <strong>PROTECTION_LEVEL_UNRESTRICTED</strong> via <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsock/nf-winsock-setsockopt"><strong>setsockopt</strong></a>. This will allow the application to receive Edge Traversal traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>

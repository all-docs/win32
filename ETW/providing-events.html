<h1>Providing Events</h1>
<p>Providers are applications that contain event tracing instrumentation. After a provider registers itself, a controller can then enable or disable event tracing in the provider. The provider defines its interpretation of being enabled or disabled. Generally, an enabled provider generates events, and a disabled provider does not. This lets you add event tracing to your application without requiring that it generate events all the time.</p>

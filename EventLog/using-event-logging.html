<h1>Using Event Logging</h1>
<p>Applications can use the Event Logging API to report and view events. For details on reporting events, see <a href="reporting-an-event.html">Reporting Events</a>.</p>
<p>To view events that have been written to log files, see <a href="querying-for-event-source-messages.html">Querying for Event Source Messages</a> and <a href="receiving-event-notification.html">Receiving Event Notification</a>. You can also use the Event Viewer to view events.</p>

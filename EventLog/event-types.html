<h1>Event Types</h1>
<p>There are five types of events that can be logged. All of these have well-defined common data and can optionally include event-specific data.</p>
<p>The application indicates the event type when it reports an event. Each event must be of a single type. The Event Viewer displays a different icon for each type in the list view of the event log.</p>
<p>The following table describes the five event types used in event logging.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Event type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Error</strong></td>
<td>An event that indicates a significant problem such as loss of data or loss of functionality. For example, if a service fails to load during startup, an Error event is logged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Warning</strong></td>
<td>An event that is not necessarily significant, but may indicate a possible future problem. For example, when disk space is low, a Warning event is logged. If an application can recover from an event without loss of functionality or data, it can generally classify the event as a Warning event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Information</strong></td>
<td>An event that describes the successful operation of an application, driver, or service. For example, when a network driver loads successfully, it may be appropriate to log an Information event. Note that it is generally inappropriate for a desktop application to log an event each time it starts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Success Audit</strong></td>
<td>An event that records an audited security access attempt that is successful. For example, a user's successful attempt to log on to the system is logged as a Success Audit event.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Failure Audit</strong></td>
<td>An event that records an audited security access attempt that fails. For example, if a user tries to access a network drive and fails, the attempt is logged as a Failure Audit event.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Selected activities of users can be tracked by auditing security events and then placing entries in a computer's security log.</p>

<h1>Event Logging Reference</h1>
<p>The Event Logging reference is divided into the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="event-logging-functions.html">Event Logging Functions</a></li>
<li><a href="event-logging-structures.html">Event Logging Structures</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The Event Logging API was designed for applications that run on the Windows ServerÂ 2003, WindowsÂ XP, or WindowsÂ 2000 operating system. In WindowsÂ Vista, the event logging infrastructure was redesigned. Applications that are designed to run on WindowsÂ Vista or later operating systems should use <a href="/windows/desktop/WES/windows-event-log">Windows Event Log</a> to log events.</p>

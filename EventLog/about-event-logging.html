<h1>About Event Logging</h1>
<p>When an error occurs, the system administrator or support representative must determine what caused the error, attempt to recover any lost data, and prevent the error from recurring. It is helpful if applications, the operating system, and other system services record important events, such as low-memory conditions or excessive attempts to access a disk. The system administrator can then use the event log to help determine what conditions caused the error and identify the context in which it occurred. By periodically viewing the event log, the system administrator may be able to identify problems (such as a failing hard disk) before they cause damage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The Event Logging API was designed for applications that run on the Windows ServerÂ 2003, WindowsÂ XP, or WindowsÂ 2000 operating system. In WindowsÂ Vista, the event logging infrastructure was redesigned. Applications that are designed to run on the WindowsÂ Vista or later operating systems should now use <a href="/windows/desktop/WES/windows-event-log">Windows Event Log</a> to log events.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
Applications that publish events that are larger than 64 kilobytes on a Windows ServerÂ 2003, WindowsÂ XP, or WindowsÂ 2000 computer will not be able to publish events on a WindowsÂ Vista or later computer.</p>

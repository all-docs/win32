<h1>Event Sources</h1>
<p>Each log in the <a href="eventlog-key.html">Eventlog key</a> contains subkeys called <em>event sources</em>. The event source is the name of the software that logs the event. It is often the name of the application or the name of a subcomponent of the application if the application is large. You can add a maximum of 16,384 event sources to the registry. The <strong>Security</strong> log is for system use only. Device drivers should add their names to the <strong>System</strong> log. Applications and services should add their names to the <strong>Application</strong> log or create a custom log.</p>
<p>The structure of the event sources is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Â Â Â SYSTEM
Â Â Â Â Â Â CurrentControlSet
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Services
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â EventLog
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Application
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â AppName
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Security
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â System
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DriverName
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â CustomLog
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â AppName
</code></pre>
<p>You cannot use a source name that has already been used as a log name. In addition, source names cannot be hierarchical; that is, they cannot contain the backslash character (&quot;\&quot;).</p>
<p>Each event source contains information (such as a <a href="message-files.html">message file</a>) specific to the software that will be logging the events, as shown in the following table.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Â </p>
<p>When an application uses the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-registereventsourcea"><strong>RegisterEventSource</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-openeventloga"><strong>OpenEventLog</strong></a> function to get a handle to an event log, the event logging service searches for the specified event source in the registry. For example, the <strong>Application</strong> log might contain event sources for Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Excel. If an application uses <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-registereventsourcea"><strong>RegisterEventSource</strong></a> or <strong>OpenEventLog</strong> with a source name of Application, SQL, or Excel, the event logging service returns a handle to the <strong>Application</strong> log.</p>
<p>An application can use the <strong>Application</strong> log without adding a new event source to the registry. If the application calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-registereventsourcea"><strong>RegisterEventSource</strong></a> and passes a source name that cannot be found in the registry, the event-logging service uses the <strong>Application</strong> log by default. However, because there are no message files, the Event Viewer cannot map any event identifiers or event categories to a description string, and will display an error. For this reason, you should add a unique event source to the registry for your application and specify a message file.</p>

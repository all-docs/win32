<h1>Service Entry Point</h1>
<p>Services are generally written as console applications. The entry point of a console application is its <strong>main</strong> function. The <strong>main</strong> function receives arguments from the <strong>ImagePath</strong> value from the registry key for the service. For more information, see the Remarks section of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-createservicea"><strong>CreateService</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>When the SCM starts a service program, it waits for it to call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-startservicectrldispatchera"><strong>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</strong></a> function. Use the following guidelines.</p>
<ul>
<li>A service of type SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS should call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-startservicectrldispatchera"><strong>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</strong></a> immediately, from its main thread. You can perform any initialization after the service starts, as described in <a href="service-servicemain-function.html">Service ServiceMain Function</a>.</li>
<li>If the service type is SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS and there is common initialization for all services in the program, you can perform the initialization in the main thread before calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-startservicectrldispatchera"><strong>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</strong></a>, as long as it takes less than 30 seconds. Otherwise, you must create another thread to do the common initialization, while the main thread calls <strong>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</strong>. You should still perform any service-specific initialization after the service starts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-startservicectrldispatchera"><strong>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</strong></a> function takes a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/ns-winsvc-service_table_entrya"><strong>SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY</strong></a> structure for each service contained in the process. Each structure specifies the service name and the entry point for the service. For an example, see <a href="writing-a-service-program-s-main-function.html">Writing a Service Program's main Function</a>.</p>
<p>If <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-startservicectrldispatchera"><strong>StartServiceCtrlDispatcher</strong></a> succeeds, the calling thread does not return until all running services in the process have entered the SERVICE_STOPPED state. The SCM sends control requests to this thread through a named pipe. The thread acts as a control dispatcher, performing the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new thread to call the appropriate entry point when a new service is started.</li>
<li>Call the appropriate <a href="service-control-handler-function.html">handler function</a> to handle service control requests.</li>
</ul>

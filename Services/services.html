<h1>Services (Services)</h1>
<p>A <em>service application</em> conforms to the interface rules of the Service Control Manager (SCM). It can be started automatically at system boot, by a user through the Services control panel applet, or by an application that uses the <a href="service-functions.html">service functions</a>. Services can execute even when no user is logged on to the system.</p>
<p>A <em>driver service</em> conforms to the device driver protocols. It is similar to a service application, but it does not interact with the SCM. For simplicity, the term <em>service</em> refers to a <em>service application</em> in this overview.</p>
<p>Triggers can now be used to control service start. For more info, see <a href="service-configuration.html">Service Configuration</a>.</p>

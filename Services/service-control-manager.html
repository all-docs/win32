<h1>Service control manager</h1>
<p>The service control manager (SCM) is started at system boot. It's a remote procedure call (RPC) server, so that service configuration and service control programs can manipulate services on remote machines.</p>
<p>The service functions provide an interface for the following tasks performed by the SCM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining the database of installed services.</li>
<li>Starting services and driver services either upon system startup or upon demand.</li>
<li>Enumerating installed services and driver services.</li>
<li>Maintaining status information for running services and driver services.</li>
<li>Transmitting control requests to running services.</li>
<li>Locking and unlocking the service database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe the SCM in more detail:</p>

<h1>Services and RPC/TCP</h1>
<p>Starting with WindowsÂ Vista, the service control manager (SCM) supports remote procedure calls over both Transmission Control Protocol (RPC/TCP) and named pipes (RPC/NP). Client-side SCM functions use RPC/TCP by default.</p>
<p>RPC/TCP is appropriate for most applications that use SCM functions remotely, such as remote administration or monitoring tools. However, for compatibility and performance, some applications might need to disable RPC/TCP by setting the registry values described in this topic.</p>
<p>When a service calls a remote SCM function, the client-side SCM first attempts to use RPC/TCP to communicate with the server-side SCM. If the server is running a version of Windows that supports RPC/TCP and allows RPC/TCP traffic, the RPC/TCPP connection will succeed. If the server is running a version of Windows that does not support RPC/TCP, or supports RPC/TCP but is operating behind a firewall which allows only named pipe traffic, the RPC/TCP connection times out and the SCM retries the connection with RPC/NP. This will succeed eventually but can take some time (typically more than 20 seconds), causing the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-openscmanagera"><strong>OpenSCManager</strong></a> function to appear blocked.</p>
<p>TCP does not carry user credentials specified with a <strong>net use</strong> command. Therefore, if RPC/TCP is enabled and <strong>sc.exe</strong> is used to attempt to access the specified service, the command could fail with access denied. Disabling RPC/TCP on the client side causes the <strong>sc.exe</strong> command to use a named pipe that does carry user credentials, so the command will succeed. For information about sc.exe, see <a href="controlling-a-service-using-sc.html">Controlling a Service Using SC</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
A service should not provide explicit credentials to a <strong>net use</strong> command, because those credentials might be inadvertently shared outside of the service boundaries. Instead, the service should use <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/client-impersonation">client impersonation</a> to impersonate the user.</p>

<h3>RPC/TCP Registry Values</h3>
<p>RPC/TCP is controlled by the <strong>SCMApiConnectionParam</strong>, <strong>DisableRPCOverTCP</strong>, and <strong>DisableRemoteScmEndpoints</strong> registry values, which are all under the <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>SYSTEM</strong>\<strong>CurrentControlSet</strong>\<strong>Control</strong> key. All of these values have a REG_DWORD data type. The following procedures show how to use these registry values to control RPC/TCP.</p>
<p>The following procedure describes how to disable RPC/TCP on the client side.</p>
<p><strong>To disable RPC/TCP on the client side</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Combine the <strong>SCMApiConnectionParam</strong> registry value with the mask value 0x80000000.</li>
<li>Restart the application that calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winsvc/nf-winsvc-openscmanagera"><strong>OpenSCManager</strong></a> function.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following procedure describes how to disable TCP on the server side.</p>
<p><strong>To disable TCP on the server side</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Set the <strong>DisableRPCOverTCP</strong> registry value to 1.</li>
<li>Restart the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following procedure describes how to disable both RPC/TCP and RPC/NP on the server (for example, to reduce the attack surface).</p>
<p><strong>To disable both RPC/TCP and RPC/NP on the server</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Set the <strong>DisableRemoteScmEndpoints</strong> registry value to 1.</li>
<li>Restart the server.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>SCMApiConnectionParam</strong> registry value can also be used to specify the RPC/TCP time-out interval, in milliseconds. For example, a value of 30,000 specifies a time-out interval of 30 seconds. The default is 21,000 (21 seconds).</p>

<h1>Using Wildcard Characters in the CONTAINS Predicate</h1>
<p>The CONTAINS predicate supports the use of the asterisk (*) as a wildcard character to represent words and phrases. You can add the asterisk only at the end of the word or phrase. The presence of the asterisk enables the prefix-matching mode. In this mode, matches are returned if the column contains the specified search word followed by zero or more other characters. If a phrase is provided, matches are detected if the column contains all the specified words with zero or more other characters following the final word.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The first example matches documents that have any word in the FileName column beginning with &quot;serv&quot;. Example matching words include &quot;server&quot;, &quot;servers&quot;, and &quot;service&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>...WHERE CONTAINS(System.FileName, '&quot;serv*&quot;')
</code></pre>
<p>The second example matches documents with any phrase in the FileName column that begins with &quot;comp&quot; and in which the next word begins with &quot;serv&quot;. Example matching words include &quot;comp server&quot;, &quot;comp servers&quot;, and &quot;comp service&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>...WHERE CONTAINS(System.FileName, '&quot;comp serv*&quot;')
</code></pre>
<p>The asterisk works only for prefix-matching and can be placed only at the end of the word or phrase; it does not work for suffix-matching. The following syntax is not valid and does not match documents with any word in the FileName column ending with &quot;serve&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>WHERE CONTAINS(System.FileName, '&quot;*serve&quot;')
</code></pre>

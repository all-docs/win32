<h1>Understanding Relevance Values</h1>
<p>In a relational database, rows that are returned by a search query must meet all the conditions called for by the query. In contrast, a Windows Search query can return documents that meet the search conditions to varying degrees.</p>
<p>For example, a search for the term &quot;program&quot; in a relational database produces records that contain that specific spelling of the word. Whether a record contains one or one hundred instances of the word has no impact on the results. In contrast, Windows Search returns a relevance value associated with the matching documents. The relevance of documents having &quot;program&quot; in the title is higher than those that contain the word only in the last paragraph. Similarly, documents containing variations of the search term, for example &quot;programs&quot; and &quot;programming&quot; also match and are returned by the query.</p>
<p>Windows Search queries return integer relevance values in the column named &quot;rank&quot;.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rank values returned by the query are integers ranging from 0 to 1000.</li>
<li>Higher rank values indicate documents that better match the search conditions.</li>
<li>Rank values apply only to the current query, so they cannot be compared for results across queries.</li>
<li>Rank values are relative to the other documents matching the query. Therefore, the rank value of a particular document depends on the other documents that also match the query.</li>
<li>Rank values for items matching a purely relational predicate are 1000.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can manipulate the returned rank values by using column weights in the <a href="-search-sql-contains.html">CONTAINS</a> and <a href="-search-sql-freetext.html">FREETEXT</a> WHERE clause predicates, and the RANK BY clause.</p>

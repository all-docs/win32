<h1>Connecting Your Web Service in Windows Federated Search</h1>
<p>This topic describes the steps involved in connecting a web service between your data store and Windows Federated Search, and how to send queries and return search results in RSS or Atom.</p>
<p>This topic is organized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#connect-your-web-service">Connect Your web Service</a></li>
<li><a href="#register-an-existing-remote-data-store">Register an Existing Remote Data Store</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Connect Your web Service</h2>
<p><strong>To connect the web service of your data store to federated search, perform the following steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create an .osdx file.</li>
<li>Supply the .osdx file to users so that they can add the service on demand by opening the .osdx file.</li>
<li>Generate a search connector and actively deploy it in your enterprise.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Register an Existing Remote Data Store</h2>
<p>A user registers a new remote data store with Windows Federated Search by opening an OpenSearch Description (.osdx) file. When the user does so, the following events occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>A .searchconnector-ms file (search connector) is created in the Windows Searches folder (%userprofile%/Searches).</li>
<li>A shortcut to the .searchconnector-ms file is created in the Links folder (%userprofile%/Links).</li>
<li>A shortcut appears in the Windows Explorer navigation <strong>Favorites</strong> pane, enabling the user to navigate into the new data store, and query the web service.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
A data store that already has an <a href="https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch">OpenSearch</a> web service that is compatible with Windows Federated Search can be added to Windows Explorer when a user opens an .osdx file.</p>

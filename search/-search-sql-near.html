<h1>NEAR Term</h1>
<p>The NEAR term is used to specify that two content search terms must be relatively close to one another to be recognized as matching for the <a href="-search-sql-contains.html">CONTAINS</a> predicate.</p>
<p>The syntax for the NEAR term is:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;content_search_term&gt; NEAR | ~ &lt;content_search_term&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The NEAR term can be represented by the keyword &quot;NEAR&quot; or by a tilde (~).</p>
<p>When the words joined by NEAR in the query are found within approximately 50 words of each other inside the column being searched, the NEAR term returns a match. The closer together the two words are, the higher the calculated rank for the NEAR term. The farther apart the two words are, the lower the rank.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The number of words between found search terms is approximate and depends on the appearance of noise words, like &quot;a&quot; or &quot;the&quot;, and how wordbreakers tokenize text. It may be less than 50.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If the match words specified with the NEAR term are both found in the column being searched, but are farther apart than 50 words, the result is still returned, but has a <a href="-search-sql-understandingrelevancevalues.html">rank</a> of 0.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows chaining of NEAR terms, using both the short and long forms of the term:</p>
<pre><code>...WHERE CONTAINS('computer NEAR software ~ &quot;setup application&quot;')
</code></pre>

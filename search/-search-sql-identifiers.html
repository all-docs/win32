<h1>Identifiers</h1>
<p>Identifiers specify the names of columns (sometimes referred to as properties), catalogs, and aliases. For example, System.ItemName and System.DateCreated are the identifiers of two system-defined property columns. Literals, by contrast, specify string and numeric values.</p>
<p>You can create identifiers that are up to 128 characters long, and in one of two types, distinguished by the characters used in the identifier name:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular identifiers</strong> contain only the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), and dot (.), and they begin with a letter. You do not need to enclose regular identifiers in double quotation marks (&quot; &quot;).</li>
<li><strong>Delimited identifiers</strong> can contain any valid Unicode character and must be enclosed in double quotation marks.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
In FREETEXT and CONTAINS clauses, you can use the asterisk (*) as a special column identifier when you want to specify that Windows Search includes all of the indexed properties in the query. Although it is not a regular identifier, it does not require double quotation marks.</p>

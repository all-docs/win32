<h1>Outlined and Filled Paths</h1>
<p>An application can draw the outline of a path by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-strokepath"><strong>StrokePath</strong></a> function, it can fill the interior of a path by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-fillpath"><strong>FillPath</strong></a> function, and it can both outline and fill the path by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-strokeandfillpath"><strong>StrokeAndFillPath</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>Whenever an application fills a path, the system uses the DC's current fill mode. An application can retrieve this mode by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-getpolyfillmode"><strong>GetPolyFillMode</strong></a> function, and it can set a new fill mode by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-setpolyfillmode"><strong>SetPolyFillMode</strong></a> function. For a description of the two fill modes, see <a href="regions.html">Regions</a>.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the cross-section of an object created by a computer-aided design (CAD) application using paths that were both outlined and filled.</p>

<h1>Line and Curve Attributes</h1>
<p>A device context (DC) contains attributes that affect line and curve output. The <em>line and curve attributes</em> include the current position, brush style, brush color, pen style, pen color, transformation, and so on.</p>
<p>The default current position for any DC is located at the point (0,0) in logical (or world) space. You can set these coordinates to a new position by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-movetoex"><strong>MoveToEx</strong></a> function and passing a new set of coordinates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
There are two sets of line- and curve-drawing functions. The first set retains the current position in a DC, and the second set alters the position. You can identify the functions that alter the current position by examining the function name. If the function name ends with the preposition &quot;To&quot;, the function sets the current position to the ending point of the last line drawn (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-lineto"><strong>LineTo</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-arcto"><strong>ArcTo</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-polylineto"><strong>PolylineTo</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-polybezierto"><strong>PolyBezierTo</strong></a>). If the function name does not end with this preposition, it leaves the current position intact (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-arc"><strong>Arc</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-polyline"><strong>Polyline</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-polybezier"><strong>PolyBezier</strong></a>).</p>

<p>The default brush is a solid white brush. An application can create a new brush by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createbrushindirect"><strong>CreateBrushIndirect</strong></a> function. After creating a brush, the application can select it into its DC by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-selectobject"><strong>SelectObject</strong></a> function. Windows provides a complete set of functions to create, select, and alter the brush in an application's DC. For more information about these functions and about brushes in general, see <a href="brushes.html">Brushes</a>.</p>
<p>The default pen is a cosmetic, solid black pen that is one pixel wide. An application can create a pen by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-extcreatepen"><strong>ExtCreatePen</strong></a> function. After creating a pen, your application can select it into its DC by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-selectobject"><strong>SelectObject</strong></a> function. Windows provides a complete set of functions to create, select, and alter the pen in an application's DC. For more information about these functions and about pens in general, see <a href="pens.html">Pens</a>.</p>
<p>The default transformation is the unity transformation (specified by the identity matrix). An application can specify a new transformation by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-setworldtransform"><strong>SetWorldTransform</strong></a> function. Windows provides a complete set of functions to transform lines and curves by altering their width, location, and general appearance. For more information about these functions, see <a href="coordinate-spaces-and-transformations.html">Coordinate Spaces and Transformations</a>.</p>

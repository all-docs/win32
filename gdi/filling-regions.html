<h1>Filling Regions</h1>
<p>An application fills the interior of a region by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-fillrgn"><strong>FillRgn</strong></a> function and supplying a handle that identifies a specific brush. When an application calls FillRgn , the system fills the region with the brush by using the current fill mode for the specified device context. There are two fill modes: alternate and winding. The application can set the fill mode for a device context by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-setpolyfillmode"><strong>SetPolyFillMode</strong></a> function. The application can retrieve the current fill mode for a device context by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-getpolyfillmode"><strong>GetPolyFillMode</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows two identical regions: one filled using alternate mode and the other filled using winding mode.</p>

<h2>Alternate Mode</h2>
<p>To determine which pixels the system highlights when alternate mode is specified, perform the following test:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a pixel within the region's interior.</li>
<li>Draw an imaginary ray, in the positive x-direction, from that pixel toward infinity.</li>
<li>Each time the ray intersects a boundary line, increment a count value.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system highlights the pixel if the count value is an odd number.</p>
<h2>Winding Mode</h2>
<p>To determine which pixels the system highlights when winding mode is specified, perform the following test:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the direction in which each boundary line is drawn.</li>
<li>Select a pixel within the region's interior.</li>
<li>Draw an imaginary ray, in the positive x-direction, from the pixel toward infinity.</li>
<li>Each time the ray intersects a boundary line with a positive y-component, increment a count value. Each time the ray intersects a boundary line with a negative y-component, decrement the count value.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system highlights the pixel if the count value is nonzero.</p>

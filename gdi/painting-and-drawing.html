<h1>Painting and Drawing</h1>
<p>This overview describes how the system manages output to the screen and explains what applications must do to draw in a window. In particular, this overview describes <em>display device contexts</em> (or, more simply, <em>display DCs</em>) and how to prepare and use them. The overview does not explain how to use graphics device interface (GDI) functions to generate output, nor does it explain how to print.</p>

<h1>Complex Scripts</h1>
<p>While the functions discussed in the preceding work well for many languages, they may not deal with the needs of complex scripts. <em>Complex scripts</em> are languages whose printed form is not rendered in a simple way. For example, a complex script may allow bidirectional rendering, contextual shaping of glyphs, or combining characters. Due to these special requirements, the control of text output must be very flexible.</p>
<p>Functions that display text <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-textouta"><strong>TextOut</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-exttextouta"><strong>ExtTextOut</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-tabbedtextouta"><strong>TabbedTextOut</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-drawtext"><strong>DrawText</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-gettextextentexpointa"><strong>GetTextExtentExPoint</strong></a> have been extended to support complex scripts. In general, this support is transparent to the application. However, applications should save characters in a buffer and display a whole line of text at one time, so that the complex script shaping modules can use context to reorder and generate glyphs correctly. In addition, because the width of a glyph can vary by context, applications should use <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-gettextextentexpointa"><strong>GetTextExtentExPoint</strong></a> to determine line length rather than using cached character widths.</p>
<p>In addition, complex script-aware applications should consider adding support for right-to-left reading order and right alignment to their applications. You can toggle the reading order or alignment between left and right with the following code:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>// Save lAlign (this example uses static variables) 
static LONG lAlign = TA_LEFT;

// When user toggles alignment (assuming TA_CENTER is not supported). 

lAlign = TA_RIGHT;

// When the user toggles reading order. 

lAlign = TA_RTLREADING;

// Before calling ExtTextOut, for example, when processing WM_PAINT  

SetTextAlign (hDc, lAlign);
</code></pre>
<p>To toggle both attributes at once, execute the following statement and then call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-settextalign"><strong>SetTextAlign</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-exttextouta"><strong>ExtTextOut</strong></a>, as shown previously:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>lAlign = TA_RIGHT^TA_RTLREADING;  //pre-inline !
</code></pre>
<p>You can also process complex scripts with Uniscribe. Uniscribe is a set of functions that allow a fine degree of control for complex scripts. For more information, see <a href="../intl/uniscribe.html">Uniscribe</a> and <a href="../intl/processing-complex-scripts.html">Processing Complex Scripts</a>.</p>

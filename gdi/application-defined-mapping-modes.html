<h1>Application-Defined Mapping Modes</h1>
<p>The two application-defined mapping modes (MM_ISOTROPIC and MM_ANISOTROPIC) are provided for application-specific mapping modes. The MM_ISOTROPIC mode guarantees that logical units in the x-direction and in the y-direction are equal, while the MM_ANISOTROPIC mode allows the units to differ. A CAD or drawing application can benefit from the MM_ISOTROPIC mapping mode but may need to specify logical units that correspond to the increments on an engineer's scale (1/64 inch). These units would be difficult to obtain with the predefined mapping modes (MM_HIENGLISH or MM_HIMETRIC); however, they can easily be obtained by selecting the MM_ISOTROPIC (or MM_ANISOTROPIC) mode. The following example shows how to set logical units to 1/64 inch:</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>SetMapMode(hDC, MM_ISOTROPIC); 
SetWindowExtEx(hDC, 64, 64, NULL); 
SetViewportExtEx(hDC, GetDeviceCaps(hDC, LOGPIXELSX), 
                      GetDeviceCaps(hDC, LOGPIXELSY), NULL); 
</code></pre>

<h1>HMONITOR and the Device Context</h1>
<p>Each physical display is represented by a monitor handle of type <strong>HMONITOR</strong>. A valid <strong>HMONITOR</strong> is guaranteed to be non-NULL. A physical display has the same <strong>HMONITOR</strong> as long as it is part of the desktop. When a <strong>WM_DISPLAYCHANGE</strong> message is sent, any monitor may be removed from the desktop and thus its <strong>HMONITOR</strong> becomes invalid or has its settings changed. Therefore, an application should check whether all <strong>HMONITORS</strong> are valid when this message is sent.</p>
<p>Any function that returns a display device context (DC) normally returns a DC for the primary monitor. To obtain the DC for another monitor, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-enumdisplaymonitors"><strong>EnumDisplayMonitors</strong></a> function. Or, you can use the device name from the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-getmonitorinfoa"><strong>GetMonitorInfo</strong></a> function to create a DC with <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createdca"><strong>CreateDC</strong></a>. However, if the function, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-getwindowdc"><strong>GetWindowDC</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-beginpaint"><strong>BeginPaint</strong></a>, gets a DC for a window that spans more than one display, the DC will also span the two displays.</p>

<h1>Translation</h1>
<p>Some applications translate (or shift) objects drawn in the client area. by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-setworldtransform"><strong>SetWorldTransform</strong></a> function to set the appropriate world-space to page-space transformation. The SetWorldTransform function receives a pointer to an <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-xform"><strong>XFORM</strong></a> structure containing the appropriate values. The eDx and eDy members of XFORM specify the horizontal and vertical translation components, respectively.</p>
<p>When <em>translation</em> occurs, each point in an object is shifted vertically, horizontally, or both, by a specified amount. The following illustration shows a 20- by 20-unit rectangle that was translated to the right by 10 units when copied from world-coordinate space to page-coordinate space.</p>
<p><img src="images/cstrn-09.png" alt="illustration showing a rectangle in one position in the world space, and in a different position in the page space" /></p>
<p>In the preceding illustration, the x-coordinate of each point in the rectangle is 10 units greater than the original x-coordinate.</p>
<p>Horizontal translation can be represented by the following algorithm.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>x' = x + Dx 
</code></pre>
<p>Where x' is the new x-coordinate, x is the original x-coordinate, and Dx is the horizontal distance moved.</p>
<p>Vertical translation can be represented by the following algorithm.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>y' = y + Dy 
</code></pre>
<p>Where y' is the new y-coordinate, y is the original y-coordinate, and Dy is the vertical distance moved.</p>
<p>The horizontal and vertical translation transformations can be combined into a single operation by using a 3-by-3 matrix.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>                      |1   0   0| 
|x' y' 1| = |x y 1| * |0   1   0| 
                      |Dx  Dy  1| 
</code></pre>
<p>(The rules of matrix multiplication state that the number of rows in one matrix must equal the number of columns in the other. The integer 1 in the matrix |x y 1| is a placeholder that was added to meet this requirement.)</p>
<p>The 3-by-3 matrix that produced the illustrated translation transformation contains the following values.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>|1  0  0| 
|0  1  0| 
|10 0  1| 
</code></pre>

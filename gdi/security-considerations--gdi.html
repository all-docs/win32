<h1>Security Considerations: GDI</h1>
<p>This topic provides information about security considerations related to GDI. This topic does not provide all you need to know about security issues. Instead, use it as a starting point and reference for this technology area.</p>
<p>GDI generally has few security concerns because it deals with display rather than input. However, here are a few issues that you should consider.</p>
<p>Bitmaps, metafiles, and fonts are complex structures that could become corrupted. It is good practice to try to ensure that these items are uncorrupted and from a trustworthy source.</p>
<p>An application can specify the security descriptor for some of the printing and spooling APIs. You should take care when setting the security descriptor.</p>

<h1>Paths (Windows GDI)</h1>
<p>A <em>path</em> is one or more figures (or shapes) that are filled, outlined, or both filled and outlined. Paths are used in drawing and painting applications. Computer-aided design (CAD) applications use paths to create unique clipping regions, to draw outlines of irregular shapes, and to fill the interiors of irregular shapes. An irregular shape is a shape composed of BÃ©zier curves and straight lines. (Regular shapes include ellipses, circles, rectangles, and polygons.)</p>

<h1>Pen Pattern</h1>
<p>The pattern attribute specifies the pattern of a geometric pen.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows lines drawn with different geometric pens. Each pen was created using a different pattern attribute.</p>
<p><img src="images/cspen-02.png" alt="illustration showing four lines, each filled with a different pen" /></p>
<p>The first line in the previous illustration is drawn using one of the six available hatch patterns; for more information about hatch patterns, see <a href="pen-hatch.html">Pen Hatch</a>. The next line is drawn using the hollow pattern, identical to the null pattern. The third line is drawn using a custom pattern created from an 8-by-8-pixel bitmap. (For more information about bitmaps and their creation, see <a href="bitmaps.html">Bitmaps</a>.) The last line is drawn using a solid pattern. Creating a brush and passing its handle to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-extcreatepen"><strong>ExtCreatePen</strong></a> function creates a pattern.</p>

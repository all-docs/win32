<h1>Predefined Mapping Modes</h1>
<p>Of the six predefined mapping modes, one is device dependent (MM_TEXT) and the remaining five (MM_HIENGLISH, MM_LOENGLISH, MM_HIMETRIC, MM_LOMETRIC, and MM_TWIPS) are device independent.</p>
<p>The default mapping mode is MM_TEXT. One logical unit equals one pixel. Positive x is to the right, and positive y is down. This mode maps directly to the device's coordinate system. The logical-to-physical mapping involves only an offset in x and y that is defined by the application-controlled window and viewport origins. The viewport and window extents are all set to 1, creating a one-to-one mapping.</p>
<p>Applications that display geometric shapes (circles, squares, polygons, and so on) make use of one of the device-independent mapping modes. For example, if you are writing an application to provide charting capabilities for a spreadsheet program and want to guarantee that the diameter of each pie chart is 2 inches, use the MM_LOENGLISH mapping mode and call the appropriate functions to draw and fill the chart. Specifying MM_LOENGLISH, guarantees that the diameter of the chart is consistent on any display or printer. If MM_TEXT is used instead of MM_LOENGLISH, a chart that appears circular on a VGA display would appear elliptical on an EGA display and would appear very small on a 300 dpi (dots per inch) laser printer.</p>

<h1>Bitmaps as Brushes</h1>
<p>A number of functions use the brush currently selected into a device context to perform bitmap operations. For example, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-patblt"><strong>PatBlt</strong></a> function replicates the brush in a rectangular region within a window, and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-floodfill"><strong>FloodFill</strong></a> function replicates the brush inside an area in a window bounded by the specified color (unlike <strong>PatBlt</strong>, <strong>FloodFill</strong> does fill nonrectangular shapes).</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-floodfill"><strong>FloodFill</strong></a> function replicates the brush within a region bounded by a specified color. However, unlike the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-patblt"><strong>PatBlt</strong></a> function, <strong>FloodFill</strong> does not combine the color data for the brush with the color data for the pixels on the display; it simply sets the color of all pixels within the enclosed region on the display to the color of the brush that is currently selected into the device context.</p>

<h1>Combined Lines and Curves</h1>
<p>In addition to drawing lines or curves, applications can draw combinations of line and curve output by calling a single function. For example, an application can draw the outline of a pie chart by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-anglearc"><strong>AngleArc</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-anglearc"><strong>AngleArc</strong></a> function draws an arc along a circle's perimeter and draws a line connecting the starting point of the arc to the circle's center. In addition to using the <strong>AngleArc</strong> function, an application can also combine line and irregular curve output by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-polydraw"><strong>PolyDraw</strong></a> function.</p>

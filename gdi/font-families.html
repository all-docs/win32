<h1>Font Families</h1>
<p>A <em>font family</em> is a set of fonts having common stroke width and serif characteristics. There are five font families. A sixth family allows an application to use the default font. The following table describes the font-families.</p>

<p>Â </p>
<p>These font families correspond to constants found in the Wingdi.h file: FF_DECORATIVE, FF_DONTCARE, FF_MODERN, FF_ROMAN, FF_SCRIPT, and FF_SWISS. An application uses these constants when it creates a font, selects a font, or retrieves information about a font.</p>
<p>Fonts within a family are distinguished by size (10 point, 24 point, and so on) and style (regular, italic, and so on).</p>

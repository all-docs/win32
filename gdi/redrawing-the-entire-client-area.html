<h1>Redrawing the Entire Client Area</h1>
<p>You can have your application redraw the entire contents of the client area whenever the window changes size by setting the CS_HREDRAW and CS_VREDRAW styles for the window class. Applications that adjust the size of the drawing based on the size of the window use these styles to ensure that they start with a completely empty client area when drawing.</p>
<p>In the following example, the window procedure draws a five-pointed star that fits neatly in the client area. It uses a common device context and must set the mapping mode as well as window and viewport extents each time the <a href="wm-paint.html"><strong>WM_PAINT</strong></a> message is processed.</p>

<h1>Multiple Display Monitors</h1>
<p>Multiple Display Monitors is a set of related features that allow applications to make use of multiple display devices at the same time. There are two ways that multiple monitors may be used: as one large desktop or as a number of independent displays. When used as one large desktop, the monitors create more screen space for applications. This is useful whenever you need to maximize your onscreen workspace, and is especially useful in desktop publishing, Web development, or video editing. When used as independent displays, the monitors can be used for playing games, debugging full-screen applications, teaching, or making presentations.</p>

<h1>Editing an Enhanced Metafile</h1>
<p>To edit a picture stored in an enhanced metafile, an application must perform the tasks described in the following procedure.</p>
<p><strong>To edit a picture stored in an enhanced metafile</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use hit-testing to capture the cursor coordinates and retrieve the position of the object (line, arc, rectangle, ellipse, polygon, or irregular shape) that the user wants to alter.</li>
<li>Convert these coordinates to logical (or world) units.</li>
<li>Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-enumenhmetafile"><strong>EnumEnhMetaFile</strong></a> function and examine each metafile record.</li>
<li>Determine whether a given record corresponds to a GDI drawing function.</li>
<li>If it does, determine whether the coordinates stored in the record correspond to the line, arc, ellipse, or other graphics element that intersects the coordinates specified by the user.</li>
<li>Upon finding the record that corresponds to the output that the user wants to alter, erase the object on the screen that corresponds to the original record.</li>
<li>Delete the corresponding record from the metafile, saving a pointer to its location.</li>
<li>Permit the user to redraw or replace the object.</li>
<li>Convert the GDI functions used to draw the new object into one or more enhanced-metafile records.</li>
<li>Store these records in the enhanced metafile.</li>
</ol>

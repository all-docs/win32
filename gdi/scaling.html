<h1>Scaling</h1>
<p>Most CAD and drawing applications provide features that scale output created by the user. Applications that include scaling (or zoom) capabilities call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-setworldtransform"><strong>SetWorldTransform</strong></a> function to set the appropriate world-space to page-space transformation. This function receives a pointer to an <a href="/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-xform"><strong>XFORM</strong></a> structure containing the appropriate values. The eM11 and eM22 members of XFORM specify the horizontal and vertical scaling components, respectively.</p>
<p>When <em>scaling</em> occurs, the vertical and horizontal lines (or vectors), that constitute an object, are stretched or compressed with respect to the x- or y-axis. The following illustration shows a 20-by-20-unit rectangle scaled vertically to twice its original height when copied from world-coordinate space to page-coordinate space.</p>
<p><img src="images/cstrn-10.png" alt="illustration showing a small rectangle in the world space and a taller one in the page space" /></p>
<p>In the preceding illustration, the vertical lines that define the original rectangle's side measure 20 units, while the vertical lines that define the scaled rectangle's sides measure 40 units.</p>
<p>Vertical scaling can be represented by the following algorithm.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>y' = y * Dy 
</code></pre>
<p>Where y' is the new length, y is the original length, and Dy is the vertical scaling factor.</p>
<p>Horizontal scaling can be represented by the following algorithm.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>x' = x * Dx 
</code></pre>
<p>Where x' is the new length, x is the original length, and Dx is the horizontal scaling factor.</p>
<p>The vertical and horizontal scaling transformations can be combined into a single operation by using a 2-by-2 matrix.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>|x' y'|  =  |Dx   0|  *  |x y| 
            |0   Dy| 
</code></pre>
<p>The 2-by-2 matrix that produced the scaling transformation contains the following values.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>|1    0| 
|0    2| 
</code></pre>

<h1>Conversion of Paths to Regions</h1>
<p>An application can convert a path into a region by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-pathtoregion"><strong>PathToRegion</strong></a> function. Like <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-selectclippath"><strong>SelectClipPath</strong></a>, <strong>PathToRegion</strong> is useful in the creation of special graphics effects. For example, there are no functions that allow an application to offset a path; however, there is a function that enables an application to offset a region (<a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-offsetrgn"><strong>OffsetRgn</strong></a>). Using <strong>PathToRegion</strong> , an application can create the effect of animating a complex shape by creating a path that defines the shape, converting the path into a region (by calling <strong>PathToRegion</strong>), and then repeatedly painting, moving, and erasing the region (by calling functions in a sequence, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-fillrgn"><strong>FillRgn</strong></a>, <strong>OffsetRgn</strong> , and <strong>FillRgn</strong>).</p>

<h1>Brushes (Windows GDI)</h1>
<p>A <em>brush</em> is a graphics tool that applications use to paint the interior of polygons, ellipses, and paths. Drawing applications use brushes to paint shapes; word processing applications use brushes to paint rules; computer-aided design (CAD) applications use brushes to paint the interiors of cross-section views; and spreadsheet applications use brushes to paint the sections of pie charts and the bars in bar graphs.</p>

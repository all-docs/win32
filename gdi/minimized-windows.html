<h1>Minimized Windows</h1>
<p>The system reduces an application's main window (overlapping style) to a minimized window when the user clicks Minimize from the window menu or the application calls the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-showwindow"><strong>ShowWindow</strong></a> function and specifies a value such as SW_MINIMIZE. Minimizing a window speeds up system performance by reducing the amount of work an application must do when updating its main window.</p>
<p>For a typical application, the system draws an icon, called the class icon, when the window is minimized, labeling the icon with the name of the window. The class icon, a static image that represents the application, is specified by the application when it registers the window class. The application assigns a handle to the class icon to the <strong>hIcon</strong> member of <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-wndclassa"><strong>WNDCLASS</strong></a> before calling <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-registerclassa"><strong>RegisterClass</strong></a>. The application can use the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-loadicona"><strong>LoadIcon</strong></a> function to retrieve the icon handle.</p>

<h1>Pen Style</h1>
<p>The style attribute specifies the line pattern that appears when a particular cosmetic or geometric pen is used. There are eight predefined pen styles. The following illustration shows the seven of these styles that are defined by the system.</p>
<p><img src="images/cspen-01.png" alt="illustration showing seven lines, each one drawn using a different predefined style" /></p>
<p>The inside-frame style is identical to the solid style for cosmetic pens. However, it operates differently when used with a geometric pen. If the geometric pen is wider than a single pixel and a drawing function uses the pen to draw a border around a filled object, the system draws the border inside the object's frame. By using the inside-frame style, an application can ensure that an object appears entirely within the specified dimensions, regardless of the geometric pen width.</p>
<p>In addition to the seven styles defined by the system, there is an eighth style that is user (or application) defined. A user-defined style generates lines with a customized series of dashes and dots.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createpen"><strong>CreatePen</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createpenindirect"><strong>CreatePenIndirect</strong></a>, or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-extcreatepen"><strong>ExtCreatePen</strong></a> function to create a pen that has the system-defined styles. Use the <strong>ExtCreatePen</strong> function to create a pen that has a user-defined style.</p>

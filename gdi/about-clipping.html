<h1>About Clipping</h1>
<p>Clipping is used by applications in a variety of ways. Word processing and spreadsheet applications clip keyboard input to keep it from appearing in the margins of a page or spreadsheet. Computer-aided design (CAD) and drawing applications clip graphics output to keep it from overwriting the edges of a drawing or picture.</p>
<p>A <em>clipping region</em> is a region with edges that are either straight lines or curves. A <em>clip path</em> is a region with edges that are straight lines, BÃ©zier curves, or combinations of both. For more information about regions, see <a href="regions.html">Regions</a>. For more information about paths, see <a href="paths.html">Paths</a>.</p>

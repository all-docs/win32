<h1>Cancellation of Drawing Operations</h1>
<p>When complex drawing applications perform lengthy graphics operations, they consume valuable system resources. By taking advantage of the system's multitasking features, an application can use threads and the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-canceldc"><strong>CancelDC</strong></a> function to manage these operations. For example, if the graphics operation performed by thread A is consuming needed resources, thread B can call the CancelDC function to halt that operation.</p>

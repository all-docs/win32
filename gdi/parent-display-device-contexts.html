<h1>Parent Display Device Contexts</h1>
<p>A <em>parent device context</em> enables an application to minimize the time necessary to set up the clipping region for a window. An application typically uses parent device contexts to speed up drawing for control windows without requiring a private or class device context. For example, the system uses parent device contexts for push button and edit controls. Parent device contexts are intended for use with child windows only, never with top-level or pop-up windows.</p>
<p>An application can specify the CS_PARENTDC style to set the clipping region of the child window to that of the parent window so that the child can draw in the parent. Specifying CS_PARENTDC enhances an application's performance because the system doesn't need to keep recalculating the visible region for each child window.</p>
<p>Attribute values set by the parent window are not preserved for the child window; for example, the parent window cannot set the brush for its child windows. The only property preserved is the clipping region. The window must clip its own output to the limits of the window. Because the clipping region for the parent device context is identical to the parent window, the child window can potentially draw over the entire parent window, but the parent device context must not be used in this way.</p>
<p>The system ignores the CS_PARENTDC style if the parent window uses a private or class device context, if the parent window clips its child windows, or if the child window clips its child windows or sibling windows.</p>

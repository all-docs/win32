<h1>Pattern Brush</h1>
<p>A pattern (or custom) brush is created from an application-defined bitmap or device-independent bitmap (DIB). The following rectangles were painted by using different pattern brushes.</p>
<p><img src="images/csbru-05.png" alt="illustration showing three boxes, each filled with a different pattern" /></p>
<p>To create a logical pattern brush, an application must first create a bitmap. After creating the bitmap, the application can create the logical pattern brush by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createpatternbrush"><strong>CreatePatternBrush</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wingdi/nf-wingdi-createdibpatternbrushpt"><strong>CreateDIBPatternBrushPt</strong></a> function, supplying a handle that identifies the bitmap (or DIB). The brushes that appear in the preceding illustration were created from monochrome bitmaps. For a description of bitmaps, DIBs, and the functions that create them, see <a href="bitmaps.html">Bitmaps</a>.</p>

<h1>Using Regions to Clip Output</h1>
<p>This section contains a single example that demonstrates how you can use regions to enable the user to define how a part of client area output can appear. Regions used for this purpose are called clipping regions.</p>
<p>The example for this section is taken from an application that enables a user to capture the entire desktop as a bitmap and then isolate and save a part of this image as a .BMP file.</p>
<p>By clicking <strong>Define Clip Region</strong> from the application's menu, the user is able to select a clipping region by clicking the left mouse button and dragging the mouse. As the user drags the mouse, the application draws a rectangle that corresponds to the new clipping region.</p>
<p>By clicking <strong>Clip</strong> from the application's menu, the user is able to redraw the isolated part of the image within the boundaries of the specified rectangle.</p>
<p>This section provides information on the following topics.</p>

<h1>DirectDraw</h1>
<p>This section contains information about programming with the DirectDraw component of the DirectX application programming interface (API).</p>
<p>DirectDraw is no longer recommended for use. With the release of Direct3D 9.0, all two-dimensional functionality is contained within Direct3D, its associated helper functions in D3DX, and the DirectX 11 technology Direct2D. However, the DirectDraw reference documentation is still available in this section.</p>
<h2>In This Section</h2>

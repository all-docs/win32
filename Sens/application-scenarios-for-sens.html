<h1>Application Scenarios for SENS</h1>
<p>Several types of applications can utilize the connectivity functions and notification services that the System Event Notification Service offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>An application that requires network connectivity status, such as an application that utilizes directory services.</li>
<li>An application that adapts its operations depending on the level of connectivity and the quality of network services, such as an Internet browser application that functions at a reduced level on a low bandwidth connection.</li>
<li>An application that can perform deferred operations such as an e-mail program that can queue messages while offline and send them when a connection is established.</li>
</ul>

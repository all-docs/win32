<h1>Mobile Computing Configurations for SENS</h1>
<p>Connectivity functions and notifications are useful for computers configured as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mobile computer used in a docking station on a high bandwidth network which may occasionally use a dial-in connection.</li>
<li>A mobile computer using a dial-in connection exclusively.</li>
<li>A desktop computer using a dial-in connection exclusively.</li>
<li>A desktop computer connected to a high bandwidth network with latency issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these configurations, the connection bandwidth and latency information can be used by an application to dynamically optimize its operations for network availability.</p>

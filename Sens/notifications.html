<h1>Notifications (System Event Notification Service)</h1>
<p>The System Event Notification Service enables mobile-aware applications to receive notifications from system events that SENS monitors. When the requested event occurs, SENS notifies the application.</p>
<p>SENS can notify applications about three classes of system events:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP/IP network events, such as the status of a TCP/IP network connection or the quality of the connection.</li>
<li>User logon events.</li>
<li>Battery and AC power events.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, an application can subscribe to any of the following system events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishment of network connectivity</li>
<li>Notification when a specified destination can be reached within specified Quality of Connection (QOC) parameters</li>
<li>The computer has switched to battery power</li>
<li>The percentage of remaining battery power is within a specified parameter</li>
<li>Scheduled events using Synchronization Manager occur</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2 and WindowsÂ 7:</strong> The subscriber has a maximum of 3 minutes to respond to a notification on the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Sensevts/nn-sensevts-isenslogon"><strong>ISensLogon</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Sensevts/nn-sensevts-isenslogon2"><strong>ISensLogon2</strong></a> interfaces. After 3 minutes, SENS cancels the call to subscribers and unblocks the notification thread. If a lengthy operation is required to respond to the notification, return from <strong>ISensLogon</strong> or <strong>ISensLogon2</strong> as quickly as possible and open another thread for processing.</p>

<h1>System Event Notification Service</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Applications designed for use by mobile users require a unique set of connectivity functions and notifications. In the past these individual applications were required to implement these features internally. The System Event Notification Service (SENS) now provides these capabilities in the operating system, creating a uniform connectivity and notification interface for applications. Using SENS developers can determine connection bandwidth and latency information from within their application and optimize the application's operation based on those conditions.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>The connectivity functions and notifications of SENS are useful for applications written for mobile computers or computers connected to high latency local area networks.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>This document is intended for software developers who develop applications for mobile computing and high latency local area networks. This document provides a complete reference of all parts of the System Event Notification Service including the SENS object and supporting methods.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>Requires Microsoft WindowsÂ XP or later. For information about which operating systems are required to use a particular interface or function, see the Requirements section of the documentation.</p>

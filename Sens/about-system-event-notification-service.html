<h1>About System Event Notification Service</h1>
<p>Applications designed for use by mobile users require a unique set of connectivity functions and notifications, and in the past individual applications were required to implement these features internally. The System Event Notification Service (SENS) now provides these capabilities in the operating system, creating a uniform connectivity and notification interface for applications. SENS, the Synchronization Manager, and Client Side Caching combine to provide the infrastructure to fully support mobile computing.</p>

<h1>ISA Operator for Event Queries</h1>
<p>The ISA operator is a WQL-specific operator that can be used in event queries. When ISA is included in the <a href="where-clause.html">WHERE clause</a> of an event query, it requests notification of events for all classes within a class hierarchy, rather than a specific event class.</p>
<p>The following example requests notification every 10 minutes of instance modification events for all instances that are members of any class derived from the <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-logicaldisk"><strong>Win32_LogicalDisk</strong></a> class.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 600
WHERE TargetInstance ISA &quot;Win32_LogicalDisk&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>For more information on using ISA with an event query, see <a href="./creating-a-timer-event-with-win32-localtime-or-win32-utctime.html">Creating a Timer Event with Win32_LocalTime or Win32_UTCTime</a>.</p>

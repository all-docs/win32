<h1>Qualifier Flavors</h1>
<p>Qualifier flavors provide more information about a qualifier, such as whether a derived class or instance can override the qualifier's original value.</p>
<p>Qualifier flavors may be added to the top of the MOF file, using the following syntax, causing them to be applied throughout the definition. For example:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>Qualifier Description : ToSubClass Amended;
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>ToSubClass</strong> and <strong>Amended</strong> flavors applies to all the <strong>Description</strong> qualifiers in the MOF.</p>
<p>The following table lists the qualifier flavors.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Qualifier Flavor</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Amended</strong></td>
<td>The qualifier is not required in the basic class definition and can be moved to the amendment to be localized.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DisableOverride</strong></td>
<td>The qualifier cannot be overridden in a derived class or instance. Note that being able to override a propagated qualifier is the default.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>EnableOverride</strong></td>
<td>When propagated to a derived class or instance, the value of the qualifier can be overridden. Setting <strong>EnableOverride</strong> is optional because being able to override the qualifier value is the default functionality for propagated qualifiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>NotToInstance</strong></td>
<td>The qualifier is not propagated to class instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>NotToSubClass</strong></td>
<td>The qualifier is not propagated to derived classes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Restricted</strong></td>
<td>The qualifier is not propagated to instances or derived classes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ToInstance</strong></td>
<td>The qualifier is propagated to instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ToSubClass</strong></td>
<td>The qualifier is propagated to derived classes. This flavor is only appropriate for qualifiers defined for a class and cannot be attached to a qualifier describing a class instance.</td>
</tr>

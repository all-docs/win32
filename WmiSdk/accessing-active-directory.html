<h1>Accessing Active Directory</h1>
<p>Active Directory is the directory service for Windows and is the foundation of Windows distributed networks. You can use Active Directory to locate objects in a computer network domain, such as users, security policies, printers, distributed components, and other resources. The name Active Directory refers both to the directory service and the directory itself.</p>

<p>Â </p>
<p>Windows makes Active Directory accessible through WMI by creating a set of references to every class and object contained in Active Directory. By accessing the Directory Services provider through WMI, you can create WMI-enabled applications that can access the wealth of information contained in Active Directory.</p>
<p>With these interfaces, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve classes and instances.</li>
<li>Enumerate classes and instances.</li>
<li>Create new instances.</li>
<li>Modify existing instances.</li>
<li>Delete existing instances.</li>
<li>Query Active Directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following topics can assist you in using Active Directory with WMI:</p>

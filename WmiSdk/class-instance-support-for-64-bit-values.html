<h1>Class Instance Support for 64-Bit Values</h1>
<p>You can use a 64-bit key value as part of a path, with the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>As long as you do not exceed the 32-bit range, you can assign and retrieve values from the key as you would a 32-bit property.</li>
<li>After you exceed the integer value of 0x7FFFFFFF (for signed types), 0x80000000 (for unsigned types), or 32 bits, you must use quotation marks.</li>
<li>The only valid path for a 64-bit value is located in the <strong>__RELPATH</strong> or <strong>__PATH</strong> properties of the instance. As such, WMI does not support the hexadecimal notation for the equivalent value.</li>
<li>If WMI records the instance key as a negative number, then you must use the original number to retrieve the instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Query semantics are unaffected and behave as expected. This behavior only affects the object path, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-getobject"><strong>GetObject</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-getobjectasync"><strong>GetObjectAsync</strong></a> operations.</p>
<p>The following example shows that class instances can have 64-bit key values.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>class MyBig
{
  [key] sint64 k;
  sint64 p;
};

instance of MyBig
{
  k = 2;
  p = 3;
};
</code></pre>

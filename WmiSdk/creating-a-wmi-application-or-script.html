<h1>Creating a WMI Application or Script</h1>
<p>Any scripting language, such as VBScript, that works with ActiveX objects can access WMI data. Applications can access WMI in C++, using the <a href="com-api-for-wmi.html">COM API for WMI</a> or in Visual Basic, using the Wbemdisp.tlb <a href="using-the-wmi-scripting-type-library.html">type library</a> and the <a href="scripting-api-for-wmi.html">Scripting API for WMI</a>. . You can obtain data through WMI by writing a script, an Active Server Page (ASP), or an HTML application (HTA). You can also use Windows PowerShell to obtain data or write scripts. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/creating-a-wmi-script">Scripting in WMI</a> and <a href="/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7&amp;preserve-view=true">Getting Started with Windows PowerShell</a>. The TechNet ScriptCenter at <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/default.aspx">https://www.microsoft.com/technet</a> contains hundreds of scripting examples. For more information about print and online resources, see <a href="further-information.html">Further Information</a>.</p>
<p>The following procedure describes how to connect to the WMI service and data store.</p>
<p><strong>To connect to the WMI service and data store</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the WMI service on a specific machine.</li>
<li>Connect to one or more WMI namespaces.</li>
</ol>
<p>These operations are different in C++, Visual Basic, .NET Framework languages, or when using a script. Scripts and Visual Basic applications must access classes whose instances are supplied with data by existing providers. But applications written in C++ can do more. For example, an application written in C++ can send events, but a WMI script can only subscribe to receive events.</p>
<p>A WMI provider can be written only in C++ or using the .NET Framework. For more information about writing applications in C# or Visual Basic .NET, see <a href="/previous-versions/bb404655(v=vs.90)">WMI .NET Overview</a>.</p>

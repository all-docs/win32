<h1>About WMI</h1>
<p>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the Microsoft implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), which is an industry initiative to develop a standard technology for accessing management information in an enterprise environment. WMI uses the Common Information Model (CIM) industry standard to represent systems, applications, networks, devices, and other managed components. CIM is developed and maintained by the Distributed Management Task Force (<a href="https://www.dmtf.org/standards/ws-man">DMTF</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The next-generation of WMI, known as the Windows Management Infrastructure (MI), is currently available. MI is fully compatible with previous versions of WMI, and provides a host of features and benefits that make designing and developing providers and clients easier than ever. For example, many newer providers are written using the MI framework, but can be accessed using WMI scripts and applications. For more information about the differences between the two technologies, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/why-use-mi-">Why Use MI?</a></p>

<h2>Managing Remote Computer Systems with WMI</h2>
<p>The ability to obtain management data from remote computers is what makes WMI useful. Remote WMI connections are made through DCOM. An alternative is to use Windows Remote Management (<a href="/windows/desktop/WinRM/portal">WinRM</a>), which obtains remote WMI management data using the WS-Management SOAP-based protocol.</p>
<h2>Programming with WMI</h2>
<p>Management applications or scripts can get data or perform operations through WMI in a variety of languages. For more information, see the Developer Audience section at <a href="wmi-start-page.html">Windows Management Instrumentation</a>.</p>
<p>Many Windows features have associated WMI providers, like the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/bcd/boot-configuration-data-portal">Boot Configuration Data (BCD) Provider</a> or the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/vdswmi/storage-volume-provider">Storage Volume Provider</a>. WMI Providers implement the functionality described by WMI classes methods and properties to manage associated Windows features. For more information, see <a href="wmi-providers.html">WMI Providers</a> and <a href="wmi-classes.html">WMI Classes</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about how to write a provider to supply data from new hardware or applications, see <a href="providing-data-to-wmi.html">Providing Data to WMI</a>.</p>

<h1>Localizing WMI Class Information</h1>
<p>WMI implements a technique that allows multiple localized versions of the same class to be stored in the repository.</p>
<p>The class definition is separated into the following versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A language-neutral version that contains only a basic class definition.</li>
<li>A language-specific version that contains localized information, such as property descriptions that are specific to a locale.</li>
</ul>
<p>The language-specific class definitions are stored in a child namespace beneath the namespace that contains a language-neutral basic class definition.</p>
<p>When you request a localized class definition for a specific locale, WMI combines the basic class definition and the localized class information to form a complete localized class. You can get a localized version of a WMI class by specifying a locale when you connect to WMI and setting a flag that indicates that you want localized information. WMI then merges the information from the language-neutral and the language-specific versions of the class definition to form a localized class.</p>
<p>WMI classes that contain localized information are marked with the <strong>Amendment</strong> qualifier and are called amended classes; a class supports localized information if it has this qualifier. You can determine which locale the class has been localized for by checking for another qualifier called <a href="swbemobjectpath-locale.html"><strong>Locale</strong></a>. The locale qualifier contains a localization identifier (Windows LCID) that identifies a locale. For example, the locale for American English is 0x409. If a qualifier in an amended class contains localized information, it contains the <strong>amended</strong> qualifier flavor.</p>
<p>WMI localization includes the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="creating-localized-class-definitions.html">Creating localized class definitions</a></li>
<li><a href="compiling-localized-mof-files.html">Compiling localized MOF files</a></li>
<li><a href="localizing-property-values.html">Localizing property values</a></li>
<li><a href="retrieving-amended-classes.html">Retrieving amended classes</a></li>
</ul>

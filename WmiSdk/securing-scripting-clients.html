<h1>Securing Scripting Clients</h1>
<p>Scripts and Visual Basic applications must set DCOM security, especially for remote access, and may also need to enable privileges.</p>
<h2>Default Access Permissions</h2>
<p>WMI access differs between local and remote computers. For more information, see <a href="connecting-to-wmi-on-a-remote-computer.html">Connecting to WMI on a Remote Computer</a>.</p>
<p>The following are the default access permissions by account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Everyone, LocalService, NetworkService</p>
<p>Permission to read or write data and to run <a href="gloss-p.html"><em>provider methods</em></a> on the local computer. These accounts cannot create new classes or install new providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrator accounts</p>
<p>Full control on local computer. When connecting to a remote computer, the account must be a local administrator on the remote computer also.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Securing a Scripting Client</h2>
<p>WMI scripting and Visual Basic applications must set DCOM security levels appropriately for the operating systems they are targeting. For more information, see <a href="setting-the-default-process-security-level-using-vbscript.html">Setting the Default Process Security Level Using VBScript</a>.</p>
<p>When connecting to a remote computer, you may need to change the service (NTLM or Kerberos) that handles authentication. For more information, see <a href="setting-the-authentication-service-using-vbscript.html">Setting the Authentication Service Using VBScript</a>.</p>
<p>Access to some WMI classes or data may require a privilege that is not enabled. For example, you must include the Security privilege when connecting to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa394225(v=vs.85)"><strong>Win32_NTEventlogFile</strong></a> class. For more information, see <a href="executing-privileged-operations-using-vbscript.html">Executing Privileged Operations Using VBScript</a>.</p>
<p>If you are accessing WMI from an Active Server Page (ASP), then some IIS configuration is required. For more information, see <a href="configuring-iis-5-for-wmi-asp-scripting.html">Configuring IIS 5.0 and Later for WMI ASP Scripting</a>.</p>
<p>You may be trying to connect to a namespace which requires an encrypted connection, in other words, one that requires an authentication level of pktPrivacy. For more information, see <a href="setting-the-default-process-security-level-using-vbscript.html">Setting the Default Process Security Level Using VBScript</a>.</p>

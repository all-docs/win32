<h1>Providing WMI Data on a 64-bit Platform</h1>
<p>Scripts and applications written for 32-bit operating systems should continue to run properly. If you have an existing 32-bit provider, you can evaluate whether you need to write a 64-bit version for side-by-side operation. Generally, both versions are not necessary and the 64-bit version can service both 32-bit and 64-bit local or remote clients. However, for 32-bit application compatibility mode, use your existing 32-bit WMI provider on a 64-bit system that runs in the 32-bit WOW64 mode.</p>
<p>In rare situations, both the 32-bit and 64-bit providers must run side-by-side on 64-bit systems. In this case, the appropriate version of provider that is loaded depends on whether the caller is 32-bit or 64-bit and local or remote. A caller using the connection object context flags, <strong>__ProviderArchitecture</strong> and <strong>__RequiredArchitecture</strong>, can request that WMI load a nondefault provider. For more information, see <a href="getting-and-providing-data-on-a-64-bit-computer.html">Getting and Providing Data on a 64-bit Computer</a>.</p>
<p>In the unusual case that you must run both the 32-bit and 64-bit providers side-by-side, then you must ensure that install and uninstall scenarios are handled carefully. This is because WMI has only one <a href="gloss-w.html"><em>repository</em></a> and both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of <a href="mofcomp.html"><strong>mofcomp.exe</strong></a> put the data in the same repository; there is no distinction between a 32-bit or a 64-bit .mof file. Reinstalling one version of the provider will not hurt: the .mof files will be compiled and the classes stored in the repository. However, a second uninstall that deletes a namespace can interfere with the operation of the other provider.</p>

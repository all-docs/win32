<h1>WMI C++ Application Examples</h1>
<p>The WMI application examples in this section are written in C++. They demonstrate a range of tasks that can be completed using WMI components and offer an alternative over using Visual Basic scripts. Each application is separated into a series of steps in a similar way so that code sections from different examples can easily be combined to form customized applications.</p>
<p>The following table lists the C++ examples in this section.</p>

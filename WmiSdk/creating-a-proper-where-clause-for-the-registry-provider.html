<h1>Creating a WHERE clause for the registry provider</h1>
<p>The main points to consider when creating a proper WHERE clause for the System Registry provider is that each event query must be complete and explicit. Failure to be complete and explicit will result in an error message.</p>
<p>To be complete, each event query in the <em>bstrQuery</em> parameter of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-execnotificationqueryasync"><strong>ExecNotificationQueryAsync</strong></a> must contain a WHERE clause that includes each of the properties in the specified event class.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to set <em>bstrQuery</em> to register for tree change events in the &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software&quot; tree.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM RegistryTreeChangeEvent  WHERE Hive = &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&quot; AND Rootpath = &quot;Software&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>To be explicit, the provider should be able to infer from the query a list of possible values for every property in the event class.</p>
<p>The following example shows the event query that correctly registers for tree change events.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM RegistryTreeChangeEvent 
    WHERE (hive = &quot;hkey_local_machine&quot; AND rootpath = &quot;software&quot;) 
    OR    (hive = &quot;hkey_current_user&quot; AND rootpath = &quot;console&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>The following is an example of an incorrect registration.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM RegistryTreeChangeEvent  WHERE hive = &quot;hkey_local_machine&quot; OR rootpath =&quot;software&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Because there is no way to evaluate the possible values for each of the properties, WMI rejects with the error WBEM_E_TOO_BROAD any query that either does not have a WHERE clause or if the WHERE clause is too broad to be of any use.</p>

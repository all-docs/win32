<h1>Querying Embedded Objects</h1>
<p>You have several options as to the form a query takes when querying an event class that contains embedded objects. The results returned by the query vary, depending on the form of the query you use.</p>
<h2>Class Definitions</h2>
<p>The following example shows the class definitions that are used for the WQL queries in this topic.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>class MyClass
{
   string Prop1;
   string Prop2;
};

class MyEvent : __ExtrinsicEvent
{
   MyClass E1;
   MyClass E2;
};
</code></pre>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following query returns both embedded classes, <strong>E1</strong> and <strong>E2</strong>, each having <strong>Prop1</strong> and <strong>Prop2</strong> populated with data.</p>
<p><code>SELECT * FROM MyEvent</code></p>
<p>The following query returns the <strong>E1</strong> embedded object, but with neither <strong>Prop1</strong> nor <strong>Prop2</strong> populated with data.</p>
<p><code>SELECT E1 FROM MyEvent</code></p>
<p>The following query returns the embedded class <strong>E1</strong> with only <strong>Prop1</strong> populated with data.</p>
<p><code>SELECT E1.Prop1 FROM MyEvent</code></p>
<p>The following query returns both embedded classes, <strong>E1</strong> and <strong>E2</strong>, each having <strong>Prop1</strong> and <strong>Prop2</strong> populated with data.</p>
<p><code>ELECT E1.Prop1, E1.Prop2, E2.Prop1, E2.Prop2 FROM MyEvent</code></p>
<p>This is equivalent to the first query using the asterisk (*) instead of specifying each object and property.</p>

<h1>References (WMI)</h1>
<p>The MOF <strong>ref</strong> key word describes an object path and maps to a VT_BSTR Automation type. The object path can be either a full path to a server and namespace, or a relative path to another object in the same namespace. You can use a <strong>ref</strong> key word to link two or more classes together. WMI supports two types of object paths, which use to define general or specific paths within WMI.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the <strong>ref</strong> key word is to reduce transport time and encoding between objects that exist entirely within the WMI repository. You can also use the <strong>ref</strong> key word to create an association between two classes. For more information, see <a href="declaring-an-association-class.html">Declaring an Association Class</a>. If the referenced item is located within the same MOF file, use an alias to initialize the <strong>ref</strong> value. For more information, see <a href="creating-an-alias.html">Creating an Alias</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
When a <strong>ref</strong> key word is applied to a key property, you can distinguish object references by the object string value instead of by the dereferenced value.</p>

<p>MOF supports the concept of a weakly typed and strongly typed object path. A weakly typed object path points to an object of an unspecified class and uses the <strong>ref</strong> key word with the <a href="object.html">OBJECT</a> keyword. A strongly typed object points to an object of a specific class and uses <strong>ref</strong> with the class name. The following example describes a weakly typed <strong>RefToAnyClass</strong> reference that can point to any class or class instance, and a <strong>RefToClassX</strong> reference that can point only to a <strong>ClassX</strong> class or instance:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>class MyClass
{
    object ref RefToAnyClass;       // Weakly typed
    ClassX ref RefToClassX;         // Strongly typed
};
</code></pre>
<p>The following example describes two instances and an association object that references the previous instances:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>#pragma namespace(&quot;\\\\.\\root&quot;)

instance of __Namespace
{
    Name = &quot;WMI&quot; ;
} ;

#pragma namespace(&quot;\\\\.\\root\\WMI&quot;)

Class A{
    [key] string aKey;
};

Class C{
    [key] string cKey;
};

// The following class creates an association 
// between the &quot;A&quot; class and the &quot;C&quot; class
    [Association] Class B{
    [key] A ref aRef;
    [Key, Min(1)] C ref cRef;
};

instance of a
{
    aKey = &quot;This is the key for the A class&quot;;
};

instance of c
{
    cKey = &quot;This is the key for the c class&quot;;
};
</code></pre>

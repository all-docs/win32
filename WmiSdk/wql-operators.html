<h1>WQL Operators</h1>
<p>The Windows Management Instrumentation Query Language (WQL) supports a set of standard operators that are used in the <a href="where-clause.html">WHERE clause</a> of a SELECT statement, as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>=</td>
<td>Equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>Less than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>Greater than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;=</td>
<td>Less than or equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;=</td>
<td>Greater than or equal to</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!= or &lt;&gt;</td>
<td>Not equal to</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>There are a few additional WQL-specific operators: IS, IS NOT, ISA, and LIKE. The IS and IS NOT operators are valid in the WHERE clause only if the constant is <strong>NULL</strong>. For example, the following queries are valid:</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM Win32_LogicalDisk WHERE FileSystem IS NULL
SELECT * FROM Win32_LogicalDisk WHERE FileSystem IS NOT NULL
</code></pre>
<p>The following queries show invalid uses of IS and IS NOT:</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM Win32_LogicalDisk WHERE DriveType IS 5
SELECT * FROM Win32_LogicalDisk WHERE FileSystem IS NOT &quot;NTFS&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The ISA operator is used in the WHERE clause of data and event queries to test embedded objects for a class hierarchy. The ISA operator eliminates the need for keeping track of newly derived classes when requesting a hierarchy of classes. When you use ISA, newly created and existing subclasses of the requested class are automatically included in the result set.</p>
<p>For more information about the syntax and use of this operator, see the following topics:</p>

<li><a href="isa-operator-for-event-queries.html">ISA Operator for Event Queries</a></li>
<li><a href="isa-operator-for-schema-queries.html">ISA Operator for Schema Queries</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The LIKE operator is valid in the WHERE clause and is used to determine whether a given character string matches a specified pattern. For example, the following query returns all instances of Win32_ classes.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM Meta_Class WHERE __Class LIKE &quot;%Win32%&quot;
</code></pre>

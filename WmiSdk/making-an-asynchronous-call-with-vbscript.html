<h1>Making an Asynchronous Call with VBScript</h1>
<p>Making an asynchronous call to a <a href="gloss-w.html"><em>WMI method</em></a> or a <a href="gloss-p.html"><em>provider method</em></a> allows a script to continue executing while objects return to an <a href="swbemsink.html"><strong>SWbemSink</strong></a> object, and are handled by methods such as <a href="swbemsink-onobjectready.html"><strong>SWbemSink.OnObjectReady</strong></a>. However, asynchronous calls are not recommended because the data may not be returned at the same level of security as the call is made.</p>
<p>When using asynchronous sink calls like <a href="swbemsink-onobjectready.html"><strong>SWbemSink.OnObjectReady</strong></a> to get returned data, you can set the following registry value.</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>SOFTWARE</strong>\<strong>Microsoft</strong>\<strong>WBEM</strong>\<strong>CIMOM</strong>\<strong>UnsecAppAccessControlDefault</strong></p>
<p>Setting this registry value ensures authentication of the data objects returned to the sink. If <strong>UnsecAppAccessControlDefault</strong> is set to one (1), then WMI performs access checking of the data return. Access checks verify that the data comes from the correct source. For more information, see <a href="setting-security-on-an-asynchronous-call.html">Setting Security on an Asynchronous Call</a>.</p>
<p>Asynchronous methods with names that end in &quot;Async_&quot; always return immediately after being called so that a program can continue executing. For example, <a href="swbemservices-execquery.html"><strong>SWbemServices.ExecQuery</strong></a> is synchronous and blocks execution until all of the objects are returned. The <a href="swbemservices-execqueryasync.html"><strong>SWbemServices.ExecQueryAsync</strong></a> method is the nonblocking asynchronous version. A more secure way to make the call to <strong>SWbemServices.ExecQuery</strong> nonblocking is by making the call <a href="gloss-s.html"><em>semisynchronously</em></a>. For more information, see <a href="setting-security-on-an-asynchronous-call.html">Setting Security on an Asynchronous Call</a> and <a href="making-a-semisynchronous-call-with-vbscript.html">Making a Semisynchronous Call with VBScript</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>iFlags</em> parameter for asynchronous calls always defaults to zero (0). Asynchronous methods do not supply an <a href="swbemobjectset.html"><strong>SWbemObjectSet</strong></a> collection to the sink subroutine. Instead, the <a href="swbemsink-onobjectready.html"><strong>SWbemSink.OnObjectReady</strong></a> event subroutine in your script or application receives each object as it is provided.</p>
<p>When the original asynchronous call is complete, it calls the <a href="swbemsink-oncompleted.html"><strong>SWbemSink.OnCompleted</strong></a> event of the object sink, and executes the code you place there to process the result of the call.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
An Active Server Page (ASP) as a script host does not support an asynchronous call.</p>

<p>The following procedure describes how to make an asynchronous call by using VBScript.</p>
<p><strong>To make an asynchronous call using VBScript</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Connect to WMI and get an <a href="swbemservices.html"><strong>SWbemServices</strong></a> object.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Set Service = GetObject(&quot;Winmgmts:&quot;)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the object sink using either <a href="/previous-versions//xzysf6hc(v=vs.85)">CreateObject</a> or (for Windows Script Host 2.0 only) the OBJECT tag with an events attribute set to <strong>TRUE</strong>.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Set sink = WScript.CreateObject(&quot;WbemScripting.SWbemSink&quot;,&quot;SINK_&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>-or-</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>&lt;OBJECT progid=&quot;WbemScripting.SWbemSink&quot; ID=&quot;SINK&quot; events=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a subroutine for each event an asynchronous event can trigger. These events are defined as methods on <a href="swbemobject.html"><strong>SWbemObject</strong></a>. For example, WMI makes a callback to <a href="swbemsink-onobjectready.html"><strong>SWbemSink.OnObjectReady</strong></a> as each instance returns.</p>
<p>When you create the subroutine, place code in the subroutine to handle each event when it is received.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Sub SINK_OnCompleted(
      iHResult, 
      objErrorObject, 
      objAsyncContext
      )
    WScript.Echo &quot;Asynchronous operation is done.&quot;
End Sub

Sub SINK_OnObjectReady(objObject, objAsyncContext)
    WScript.Echo (objObject.Name)
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>Examine the <em>iHresult</em> parameter returned by the <a href="swbemsink-oncompleted.html"><strong>OnCompleted</strong></a> event to determine whether or not the asynchronous call is successful, or if an error occurred. If successful, the value passed in the <em>iHresult</em> parameter is equal to zero (0). Any other value may indicate an error, and you should check the values in the error object that is returned in the <em>objErrorObject</em> parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make an asynchronous call and pass the name of your sink in the <em>objWbemSink</em> parameter.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>Service.InstancesOfAsync sink, &quot;Win32_process&quot;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a call that prevents the script from ending before all of the events are received. If your script can run with a screen interface, a simple way to do this is to use a Windows Script Host (WSH) <code>Echo</code> command, which is shown in the following example.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>WScript.Echo &quot;Waiting for instances.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>When you execute this script you may see the first instance return before the <strong>Waiting for instances</strong> message or you may see it after. This is the nature of asynchronous processing. If you close the <strong>Waiting for instances</strong> message box too soon, you may not see all of the instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have results from several different asynchronous calls returning to the same sink, store any necessary distinguishing data in the <em>objWbemAsyncContext</em> context parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When finished with the sink, cancel your asynchronous call with the <a href="swbemsink-cancel.html"><strong>Cancel</strong></a> method.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>objwbemsink.Cancel()
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="swbemsink-cancel.html"><strong>Cancel</strong></a> method instructs WSH to cancel all of the asynchronous calls associated with a given sink object. Thus, you may want to use separate sinks for asynchronous operations that must be independent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release the sink object by assigning the sink object to <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>set objwbemsink= Nothing
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following code example shows an asynchronous query for all the instances of <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-process"><strong>Win32_Process</strong></a> on the local machine. For a semisynchronous version of the same method, see <a href="calling-a-method.html">Calling a Method</a>.</p>
<pre lang="VB"><code>' Create an object sink
set oSink = WScript.CreateObject(&quot;wbemscripting.swbemsink&quot;,&quot;sink_&quot;)
' Connect to WMI and the cimv2 namespace, and obtain
' an SWbemServices object
set oSvc = GetObject(&quot;winmgmts:root\cimv2&quot;)

bdone = false
' Query for all Win32_Process objects
osvc.ExecQueryAsync oSink, &quot;SELECT Name FROM Win32_Process&quot;
' Wait until all instances are returned. 
' The bdone flag prevents the script from exiting until
' the sink.OnCompleted subroutine is executed when
' all the objects are returned.
while not bdone    
    wscript.sleep 1000
wend

' The sink subroutine to handle the OnObjectReady 
' event. This is called as each object returns.
sub sink_OnObjectReady(oInst, octx)
    WScript.Echo &quot;Got Instance: &quot; &amp; oInst.Name
end sub
' The sink subroutine to handle the OnCompleted event.
' This is called when all the objects are returned. 
' The oErr parameter obtains an SWbemLastError object,
' if available from the provider.
sub sink_OnCompleted(HResult, oErr, oCtx)
    WScript.Echo &quot;ExecQueryAsync completed&quot;
    bdone = true
end sub
</code></pre>

<h1>Starting and stopping WMI service</h1>
<p>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) runs as a service with the display name <strong>Windows Management Instrumentation</strong> and the service name <strong>winmgmt</strong>. WMI runs automatically at system startup under the <em>LocalSystem</em> account. If WMI isn't running, it automatically starts when the first management application or script requests connection to a WMI namespace.</p>
<p>Several other services depend on the WMI service, based on the operating system version that the system is running.</p>
<h2>Start winmgmt service</h2>
<p>The following procedure describes how to start the WMI service:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At a command prompt, enter <code>net start winmgmt [/&lt;switch&gt;]</code>.</p>
<p>For more information about the switches that are available, see <a href="winmgmt.html">winmgmt</a>. You use the built-in Administrator account or an account in the Administrators group running with elevated rights to start the WMI service. For more information, see <a href="user-account-control-and-wmi.html">User Account Control and WMI</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other services that are dependent on the WMI service, such as SMS Agent Host or Windows Firewall, don't automatically restart.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Stop winmgmt service</h2>
<p>The following procedure describes how to stop the WMI service:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At a command prompt, enter <code>net stop winmgmt</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other services that are dependent on the WMI service also halt, such as SMS Agent Host or Windows Firewall.</p>
</li>
</ol>

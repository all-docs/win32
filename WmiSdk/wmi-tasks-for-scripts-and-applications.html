<h1>WMI tasks for scripts and applications</h1>
<p>The following sections describe various computer and network administration tasks and provide links to the WMI class or classes used to perform those tasks. For more information, see <a href="creating-a-wmi-application-or-script.html">Creating a WMI Application or Script</a>. For more info about using WMI, see <a href="further-information.html">Further information</a>.</p>
<p>(These resources might not be available in every language or country/region.)</p>
<p>For more information about how to provide data to WMI, see <a href="using-wmi.html">Using WMI</a>, which will reference topics about writing a WMI <a href="gloss-p.html"><em>provider</em></a>.</p>
<p>The operations shown in script examples can be performed by applications in C++ or Visual Basic. For more information, see <a href="creating-a-wmi-application-using-c-.html">Creating a WMI Application Using C++</a> and <a href="wmi-c---application-examples.html">WMI C++ Application Examples</a>.</p>
<p>The following table lists the categories of tasks.</p>

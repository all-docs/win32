<h1>Creating a WMI Application Using C++</h1>
<p>To create an application for WMI using C++: you must initialize COM, access and set WMI protocols, and perform a manual cleanup. However, C++ does have the advantage of flexibility and power. Therefore, while you are better served in using VisualÂ Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) or Windows PowerShell for simple processes, C++ works better for more sophisticated applications and is required for writing <a href="providing-data-to-wmi.html">providers</a>.</p>
<p>The following procedure describes how to create a WMI application.</p>
<p><strong>To create a WMI application</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="initializing-com-for-a-wmi-application.html">Initialize COM</a>.</p>
<p>Because WMI is based on COM technology, you must perform calls to the <a href="/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializeex"><strong>CoInitializeEx</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-coinitializesecurity"><strong>CoInitializeSecurity</strong></a> functions to access WMI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="creating-a-connection-to-a-wmi-namespace.html">Create a connection to a WMI namespace</a>.</p>
<p>By definition, WMI runs in a different process than your application. Therefore, you must create a connection between your application and WMI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="setting-the-security-levels-on-a-wmi-connection.html">Set the security levels on the WMI connection</a>.</p>
<p>To use the connection you create to WMI, you must set the impersonation and authentication levels for your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement the purpose of your application.</p>
<p>WMI exposes a variety of COM interfaces use to access and manipulate data across your enterprise. For more information, see <a href="manipulating-class-and-instance-information.html">Manipulating Class and Instance Information</a>, <a href="receiving-a-wmi-event.html">Receiving a WMI Event</a>, and <a href="com-api-for-wmi.html">COM API for WMI</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the bulk of your WMI client application should exist, such as accessing WMI objects or manipulating data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="cleaning-up-and-shutting-down-a-wmi-application.html">Cleanup and shut down your application</a>.</p>
<p>After you complete your queries to WMI, you should destroy all COM pointers and shut down your application correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>

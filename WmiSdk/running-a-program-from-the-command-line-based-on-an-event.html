<h1>Running a Program from the Command Line Based on an Event</h1>
<p>The <a href="commandlineeventconsumer.html"><strong>CommandLineEventConsumer</strong></a> class runs a specified executable program from a command line when a specified event occurs. This class is a standard event consumer that WMI provides.</p>
<p>When you use <a href="commandlineeventconsumer.html"><strong>CommandLineEventConsumer</strong></a>, you should secure the executable that you want to start. If the executable is not in a secure location or not secured with a strong access control list (ACL), a user without access privileges can replace your executable with a different executable. You can use the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-logicalfilesecuritysetting"><strong>Win32_LogicalFileSecuritySetting</strong></a> or <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/secrcw32prov/win32-logicalsharesecuritysetting"><strong>Win32_LogicalShareSecuritySetting</strong></a> classes to change programmatically the security of a file or share. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/creating-a-security-descriptor-for-a-new-object-in-c--">Creating a Security Descriptor for a New Object in C++</a>.</p>
<p>The basic procedure to use standard consumers is always the same, and is located in <a href="monitoring-and-responding-to-events-with-standard-consumers.html">Monitoring and Responding to Events with Standard Consumers</a>. The following procedure adds to the basic procedure, is specific to the <a href="commandlineeventconsumer.html"><strong>CommandLineEventConsumer</strong></a> class, and describes how to create an event consumer that runs a program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Caution]</p>
<p>The <a href="commandlineeventconsumer.html"><strong>CommandLineEventConsumer</strong></a> class has special security constraints. This standard consumer must be configured by a local member of the Administrators group on the local computer. If you use a domain account to create the subscription, the LocalSystem account must have the necessary permissions on the domain to verify that the creator is a member of the local Administrators group.</p>
<p><a href="commandlineeventconsumer.html"><strong>CommandLineEventConsumer</strong></a> cannot be used to start a process that runs interactively.</p>

<p>The following procedure describes how to create an event consumer that runs a process from a command line.</p>
<p><strong>To create an event consumer that runs a process from a command line</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In the Managed Object Format (MOF) file, create an instance of <a href="commandlineeventconsumer.html"><strong>CommandLineEventConsumer</strong></a> to receive the events you request in the query. For more information, see <a href="designing-managed-object-format--mof--classes.html">Designing Managed Object Format (MOF) Classes</a>.</li>
<li>Create an instance of <a href="--eventfilter.html"><strong>__EventFilter</strong></a> and give it a name.</li>
<li>Create a query to specify the type of event. For more information, see <a href="querying-with-wql.html">Querying with WQL</a>.</li>
<li>Create an instance of <a href="--filtertoconsumerbinding.html"><strong>__FilterToConsumerBinding</strong></a> to associate the filter with the instance of <a href="commandlineeventconsumer.html"><strong>CommandLineEventConsumer</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Compile your MOF file by using <a href="mofcomp.html"><strong>Mofcomp.exe</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following code example creates a new class called &quot;MyCmdLineConsumer&quot; to generate events when an instance of the new class is created at the end of a MOF. The example is in MOF code, but you can create the instances programmatically by using the <a href="scripting-api-for-wmi.html">Scripting API for WMI</a> or the <a href="com-api-for-wmi.html">COM API for WMI</a>.</p>
<p>The following procedure describes how to create a new class called MyCmdLineConsumer.</p>
<p><strong>To create a new class called MyCmdLineConsumer</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create the c:\cmdline_test.bat file with a command that executes a visible program, such as &quot;calc.exe&quot; .</li>
<li>Copy the MOF to a text file and save it with a .mof extension.</li>
<li>In a Command window, compile the MOF file by using the following command: <strong>Mofcomp filename.mof</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The program specified in cmdline_test.bat should execute.</p>

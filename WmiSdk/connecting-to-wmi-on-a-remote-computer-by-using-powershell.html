<h1>Connecting to WMI Remotely with PowerShell</h1>
<p>Windows PowerShell provides a simple mechanism to connect to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) on a remote computer. Remote connections in WMI are affected by the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754274(v=ws.11)">Windows Firewall</a>, DCOM settings, and <a href="/previous-versions/aa905108(v=msdn.10)">User Account Control (UAC)</a>. For more information about configuring remote connections, see <a href="connecting-to-wmi-remotely-starting-with-vista.html">Connecting to WMI Remotely Starting with Windows Vista</a>.</p>
<p>The examples in this topic are based on the VBScripts from <a href="connecting-to-wmi-on-a-remote-computer.html">Connecting to WMI on a Remote Computer</a>. All of the examples in this topic use the <a href="/previous-versions//dd315295(v=technet.10)">Get-WmiObject</a> cmdlet. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions//dd315295(v=technet.10)">Get-WmiObject</a>.</p>
<h2>Windows PowerShell examples</h2>
<p>When creating a connection to a remote computer, a user can specify the connection information such as the remote computer name, credentials, and the authentication level for the connection. The following examples illustrate how to connect to a remote computer by using different sets of credentials and how to access WMI information.</p>
<p>The following Windows PowerShell example shows setting the impersonation level:</p>
<pre lang="PowerShell"><code>
Get-WmiObject -Namespace &quot;root\cimv2&quot; -Class Win32_Process -Impersonation 3 -ComputerName Computer_B
</code></pre>
<p>In the preceding example, the user connects to a remote computer by using the same credentials (domain and user name) that they logged on with. The user also requested to use impersonation. Unlike the original VBScript example, a moniker string is not needed because the impersonation level is set by the &quot;Impersonation&quot; property. By default, the impersonation level is set to 3 (Impersonate).</p>
<p>The example lists all the instances of the <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-process"><strong>Win32_Process</strong></a> class that are running on remote computer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
You should specify the WMI namespace to connect to on the remote computer because it is possible that the default namespace is not the same on different computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The following Windows PowerShell example shows how to connect to a remote computer with different credentials and to set the impersonation level to 3, which is Impersonate:</p>
<pre lang="PowerShell"><code>
$Computer = &quot;atl-dc-01&quot;

Get-WmiObject -Namespace &quot;root\cimv2&quot; -Class Win32_Process -Impersonation 3 -Credential `
FABRIKAM\administrator -ComputerName $Computer
</code></pre>
<p>In the preceding example, the computer name was assigned to the $Computer variable. The user connects to a remote computer by using specific credentials (domain and user name) and requests impersonation for the authentication level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The grave-accent character (`) is used to indicate a line break. It is equivalent to the underscore character (_) in VBScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The following Windows PowerShell example connects to a group of remote computers in the same domain by creating an array of remote computer names and then displaying names of the Plug and Play devicesâ€”instances of <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-pnpentity"><strong>Win32_PnPEntity</strong></a>â€”on each computer:</p>
<pre lang="PowerShell"><code>$ArrComputers = &quot;Computer1&quot;, &quot;Computer2&quot;, &quot;Computer3&quot;
foreach ($Computer in $ArrComputers) 
{
write-host &quot;&quot;
write-host &quot;====================================&quot;
write-host &quot;Computer: $Computer&quot;
write-host &quot;====================================&quot;

write-host &quot;-----------------------------------&quot;
write-host &quot;Win32_PnPEntity instance&quot;
write-host &quot;-----------------------------------&quot;

$ColItems = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnPEntity -Namespace &quot;root\cimv2&quot; -Computer $Computer
$ColItems[0..47] | Format-List Name, Status
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
To run the preceding Windows PowerShell script, you must be an administrator on the remote computers. Also, relating to the preceding example, note the following:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<ul>
<li>The computer names in the array must be enclosed in quotation marks because they are strings.</li>
<li>The objects returned by the <a href="/previous-versions//dd315295(v=technet.10)">Get-WmiObject</a> are assigned to the $ColItems variable.</li>
<li>The range operator [] limited the list of Plug and Play devices to 48 instances. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions//dd347588(v=technet.10)">About_Operators</a>.</li>
<li>The &quot;|&quot; is the pipeline character. The object returned by ColItems is sent to the <a href="/previous-versions//dd347700(v=technet.10)">Format-List</a> cmdlet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following Windows PowerShell example enables you to connect to a remote computer on a different domain. This example also displays the process names for instances of <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-process"><strong>Win32_Process</strong></a> on the remote computer.</p>
<pre lang="PowerShell"><code>$Computer = &quot;FullComputerName&quot; 
$Domain = &quot;DOMAIN&quot;
$Credential = Get-Credential
$ColItems = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Process -Authority &quot;ntlmdomain:$Domain&quot; `
-Credential $Credential -Locale &quot;MS_409&quot; -Namespace &quot;root\cimv2&quot;  -ComputerName $Computer

foreach ($ObjItem in $colItems) 
{
write-host &quot;Process Name:&quot; $ObjItem.name
}
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
To run the preceding Windows PowerShell script, you must be an administrator on the remote computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>In the preceding example, the user connects to a remote computer on a different domain and specifies a preferred locale. The <a href="/previous-versions//dd315327(v=technet.10)">Get-Credential</a> command requests the user's credentials and assigns the credentials to an object. The example also lists the names of instances of the <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-process"><strong>Win32_Process</strong></a> class that are running on the computer.</p>

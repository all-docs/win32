<h1>Describing the LDAP Namespace</h1>
<p>When connecting remotely to an Active Directory server other than the one in your current domain, you must specify the name of a computer that is already a member of the domain belonging to the Active Directory you want.</p>
<p>To remotely connect to a computer that is already a member of the domain belonging to the Active Directory server, type the following command.</p>
<p><strong>\\RemoteComputer\root\directory\LDAP</strong></p>
<p>This example shows that there are two parts that make up a fully qualified namespace name. The first part (\\RemoteComputer) represents the computer that is already a member of the domain belonging to the Active Directory server you want. The second part (\root\directory\LDAP) represents the Active Directory schema in the Directory Services Provider.</p>

<h1>ISA Operator for Data Queries</h1>
<p>Use the ISA operator in the WHERE clause of a data query to request embedded objects in a class hierarchy.</p>
<p>The following example shows the syntax to request embedded objects in a class hierarchy.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM Class WHERE EmbeddedProp ISA &quot;ParentClass&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>The result includes instances of <strong>Class</strong> having embedded objects that are derived from <strong>ParentClass</strong> in the <strong>EmbeddedProp</strong> property. Not every instance of the <strong>Class</strong> object is derived from <strong>ParentClass</strong>, but the result returns the embedded objects that are derived from <strong>ParentClass</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, in the following query, <strong>ClassA</strong> includes the weakly typed <strong>EmbeddedObj</strong> property. The <strong>ClassA</strong> class has ten instances. Five of those instances have embedded objects with a type derived from <strong>ClassZ</strong>. The other five have embedded objects of other types.</p>
<p>The following example shows the query that returns the five instances, which include the objects that are derived from <strong>ClassZ</strong>.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT * FROM ClassA WHERE EmbeddedObj ISA &quot;ClassZ&quot;
</code></pre>

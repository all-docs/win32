<h1>Creating a Managed WMI Client</h1>
<p>The current release of WMI does contain the System.Management namespace, which exposes a number of API's that interact with WMI. However, it is not recommended that you use this namespace.</p>
<p>If you wish to create a managed WMI client, it is recommended that you use the Windows Management Infrastructure (MI). MI is the next-generation version of WMI, and contains full support for managed code. For more information, see <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmi_v2/how-to-implement-a-managed-mi-client">How to Implement a Managed MI Client</a>.</p>

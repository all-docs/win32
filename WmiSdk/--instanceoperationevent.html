<h1>__InstanceOperationEvent class</h1>
<p>The <strong>__InstanceOperationEvent</strong> system class serves as a base class for all intrinsic events that relate to an instance.</p>
<p>The following syntax is simplified from Managed Object Format (MOF) code and includes all inherited properties. Properties are listed in alphabetic order, not MOF order.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>class __InstanceOperationEvent : __Event
{
  uint8  SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR[];
  object TargetInstance;
  uint64 TIME_CREATED;
};
</code></pre>
<h2>Members</h2>
<p>The <strong>__InstanceOperationEvent</strong> class has these types of members:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#properties">Properties</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>The <strong>__InstanceOperationEvent</strong> class has these properties.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Data type: <strong>uint8</strong> array</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Access type: Read-only</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Descriptor used by the event provider to determine which users can receive the event. This property is inherited from <a href="--event.html"><strong>__Event</strong></a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>TargetInstance</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Data type: <strong>object</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Access type: Read-only</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Instance affected by the event. For creation events, this is the newly created instance. For modification events, this is the new version of the changed instance. For deletion events, this is the deleted instance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>TIME_CREATED</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Data type: <strong>uint64</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Access type: Read-only</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unique value that indicates the time at which the event was generated. This is a 64-bit value that represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals after January 1, 1601. The information is in the Coordinated Universal Times (UTC) format. This property is inherited from <a href="--event.html"><strong>__Event</strong></a>.</p>
<p>For more information about using <strong>uint64</strong> values in scripts, see <a href="/windows/desktop/WmiSdk/creating-a-wmi-script">Scripting in WMI</a>.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The <strong>__InstanceOperationEvent</strong> class is derived from <a href="--event.html"><strong>__Event</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Instances of <strong>__InstanceOperationEvent</strong> are not created; only instances of its subclasses are created. The following classes derive from <strong>__InstanceOperationEvent</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="--instancecreationevent.html"><strong>__InstanceCreationEvent</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="--instancemodificationevent.html"><strong>__InstanceModificationEvent</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="--instancedeletionevent.html"><strong>__InstanceDeletionEvent</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Just as there is a WMI class that represents each type of system resource that can be managed using WMI, there is a WMI class that represents each type of WMI event. When an event that can be monitored by WMI occurs, an instance of the corresponding WMI event class is created. A WMI event occurs when that instance is created.</p>
<p>There are three major types of WMI event classes, all of which are derived from the <a href="--event.html"><strong>__Event</strong></a> WMI class: Intrinsic Events, Extrinsic Events, and Timer Events. Intrinsic Events, in turn, are represented by three distinct classes derived from the <strong>__Event</strong> class: <a href="--namespaceoperationevent.html"><strong>__NamespaceOperationEvent</strong></a>, <strong>__InstanceOperationEvent</strong>, and <a href="--classoperationevent.html"><strong>__ClassOperationEvent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Intrinsic Events</p>
<p>Intrinsic events are used to monitor a resource represented by a class in the CIM repository. Each resource is represented by an instance of a class. This means that monitoring a resource using WMI actually involves monitoring the instances that correspond to the resource.</p>
<p>Intrinsic events can also be used to monitor changes to a namespace or class in the repository. However, monitoring changes to namespaces or classes is of limited value to system administrators.</p>
<p>An intrinsic event is represented by an instance of a class derived from __InstanceOperationEvent, __NamespaceOperationEvent, or __ClassOperationEvent. Any changes to instances in WMI are represented by the __InstanceOperationEvent class and the classes derived from it: __InstanceCreationEvent, __InstanceModificationEvent, and __InstanceDeletionEvent.</p>
<p>Monitoring resources using WMI involves monitoring instances and all changes to instances are represented by __InstanceOperationEvent and the classes derived from it. This means that monitoring resources ultimately involves monitoring instances of __InstanceOperationEvent-derived classes.</p>
<p>You register interest in instances of one of these classes by issuing a notification query expressed in WQL. The query uses syntax similar to the following:</p>
<p><code>SELECT * FROM __InstanceOperationEventOrDerivedClass WITHIN PollingInterval WHERE TargetInstance ISA WMIClassName AND TargetInstance.WMIClassPropertyName = Value</code></p>

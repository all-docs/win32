<h1>WmiPerfInst Provider</h1>
<p>Starting with WindowsÂ Vista, the WmiPerfInst provider supplies raw and formatted performance counter data dynamically to WMI <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/performance-counter-classes">Performance Counter Classes</a> derived from <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-perf"><strong>Win32_Perf</strong></a>. This provider replaces the <a href="formatted-performance-data-provider.html">Formatted Performance Data Provider</a>, also known as the &quot;Cooked Counter Provider&quot;, and the <a href="performance-counter-provider.html">Performance Counter Provider</a>.</p>
<p>The WmiPerfInst provider supplies data to the WMI classes that are provided by the <a href="wmiperfclass-provider.html">WMIPerfClass</a> provider. This provider is a bridge between Performance Data Helper (PDH) instances and the WMI performance classes supplied by the WmiPerfClass Provider. When WmiPerfInst receives a query for data, it loads the class and uses the class and property <a href="qualifiers-specific-to-wmi-performance-classes.html">qualifiers</a> to locate the PDH instances. For more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/PerfCtrs/using-the-pdh-functions-to-consume-counter-data">Using the PDH Functions to Consume Counter Data</a>.</p>
<p>It is not recommended that you develop new performance objects by creating a WMI high-performance provider and depend on the <a href="gloss-r.html"><em>ADAP reverse adapter</em></a> process to transfer the data to the performance libraries. The exception is when you are developing a Windows Driver Model driver and want to supply performance data. While the reverse adapter process continues to work for backward compatibility, the recommended method is to use <a href="/windows/desktop/PerfCtrs/performance-counters-portal">Performance Counters Version 6.0</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="--win32provider.html"><strong>__Win32Provider</strong></a> instance name of this provider is &quot;WmiPerfInst&quot;.</p>

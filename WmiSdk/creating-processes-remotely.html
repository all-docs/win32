<h1>Creating Processes Remotely using WMI</h1>
<p>You can use <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/create-method-in-class-win32-process"><strong>Win32_Process.Create</strong></a> to execute a script or application on a remote computer. However, for security reasons, the process cannot be interactive. When <strong>Win32_Process.Create</strong> is called on the local computer, the process can be interactive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
This topic describes the general procedure for creating a remote process with WMI. If you are simply looking to run a script on a remote system, see <a href="connecting-to-wmi-remotely-starting-with-vista.html">Connecting to WMI Remotely Starting with Windows Vista</a>, or <a href="connecting-to-wmi-on-a-remote-computer-by-using-powershell.html">Connecting to WMI on a Remote Computer by Using Windows PowerShell</a>. For more general information on remoting with PowerShell, see <a href="/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands">Running Remote Commands</a>.</p>

<p>The remote process has no user interface but it is listed in the <strong>Task Manager</strong>. A process created locally can run under any account if the account has the <strong>Execute Method</strong> permission for the root\cimv2 namespace. A process created remotely can run under any account if the account has the <strong>Execute Method</strong> and <strong>Remote Enable</strong> permissions for root\cimv2. The <strong>Execute Method</strong> and <strong>Remote Enable</strong> permissions are set in WMI Control in the Control Panel. For more information, see <a href="setting-namespace-security-with-the-wmi-control.html">Setting Namespace Security with the WMI Control</a>.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/create-method-in-class-win32-scheduledjob"><strong>Win32_ScheduledJob.Create</strong></a> to create an interactive process remotely. But processes started by <strong>Win32_ScheduledJob.Create</strong> run under the LocalSystem account that can confer too much privilege.</p>

<h1>Executing Privileged Operations</h1>
<p>Privileged operations require security privileges such as <strong>SeLoadDriverPrivilege</strong> (<strong>wbemPrivilegeLoadDriver</strong> in the <a href="scripting-api-constants.html">Scripting API Constants</a>), a privilege that must be enabled for an account that is loading a device driver. You cannot add privileges to an administrator or user through WMI, you can only enable privileges that the account already has. For a list of privileges, see <a href="privilege-constants.html"><strong>Privilege_Constants</strong></a>.</p>
<p>By default, a local user on a computer can read static data from the <a href="gloss-w.html"><em>WMI repository</em></a>, write to instances supplied by providers, and execute provider methods, unless the provider enforces special security requirements of its own. Only administrators can <a href="connecting-to-wmi-on-a-remote-computer.html">connect to a remote computer</a>, change security descriptors, or change static WMI repository data, such as a WMI class definition. All privileges are enabled for a remote connection. For more information, see <a href="securing-a-remote-wmi-connection.html">Securing a Remote WMI Connection</a>.</p>
<p>The privilege constants for C++ differ from those that are used by automation languages such as Visual Basic. Scripts must use the value of the constant rather than the name. For more information, see <a href="executing-privileged-operations-using-c-.html">Executing Privileged Operations Using C++</a> or <a href="executing-privileged-operations-using-vbscript.html">Executing Privileged Operations Using VBScript</a>.</p>
<p>A common cause of access denied errors when using WMI is the lack of an enabled privilege for operations, such as getting all instances of <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa394225(v=vs.85)"><strong>Win32_NTEventlogFile</strong></a>. Without enabling the <strong>SeSecurity</strong> privilege, you cannot access the Security log file.</p>
<p>The following VBScript code example shows how to set the <strong>SeSecurity</strong> privilege in the moniker string. When used in the moniker, the privilege name in parentheses drops the initial &quot;Se&quot;. For more information, see <a href="constructing-a-moniker-string.html">Constructing a Moniker String</a>.</p>

Set objWMIService = GetObject(&quot;winmgmts:&quot; _
    &amp; &quot;{impersonationLevel=impersonate,(Security)}!\\&quot; _
    &amp; strComputer &amp; &quot;\root\cimv2&quot;)
Set colFiles = objWMIService.ExecQuery _
    (&quot;Select * from Win32_NTEventLogFile &quot; _
    &amp; &quot;Where LogFileName='Security'&quot;)
For Each LogFile in colFiles
Wscript.Echo LogFile.NumberOfRecords

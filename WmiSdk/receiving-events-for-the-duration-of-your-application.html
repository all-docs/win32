<h1>Receiving Events for the Duration of Your Application</h1>
<p>One of the most common ways to receive an event is through a running application, such as a management application that collects and displays events to a user. Such applications are called &quot;temporary&quot; because a temporary consumer does not receive event notifications when shut down.</p>
<p>A temporary consumer calls <a href="swbemservices-execnotificationquery.html"><strong>SWbemServices.ExecNotificationQuery</strong></a> in script or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WbemCli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-execnotificationquery"><strong>IWbemServices.ExecNotificationQuery</strong></a> in C++ to subscribe to events in a namespace. The identity associated with this subscription is the caller.</p>
<p>A temporary event consumer can receive notifications either asynchronously or semisynchronously in both scripts and C++.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
For security reasons, it is important to note that asynchronous event notifications are not recommended. For more information, see <a href="setting-security-on-an-asynchronous-call.html">Setting Security on an Asynchronous Call</a>. Event consumers have special security concerns. For more information, see <a href="securing-wmi-events.html">Securing WMI Events</a>.</p>

<h1>Securing WMI Events</h1>
<p>WMI events are delivered by the <a href="gloss-e.html"><em>event provider</em></a> to a <a href="gloss-t.html"><em>temporary</em></a> or <a href="gloss-p.html"><em>permanent</em></a> consumer. The WMI event system uses the comparison of <a href="gloss-s.html"><em>security descriptors</em></a> on events and user account <a href="gloss-s.html"><em>SIDs</em></a> to control event access.</p>
<p>Events are delivered in the form of an instance of an event class usually, but not necessarily, derived ultimately from <a href="--event.html"><strong>__Event</strong></a>. WMI supplies several general event classes in the <a href="wmi-system-classes.html">WMI System Classes</a>, such as <a href="--instancemodificationevent.html"><strong>__InstanceModificationEvent</strong></a>. Providers may also supply their own event classes. For example, the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/regprov/system-registry-provider">System Registry Provider</a> has event classes that report the change of a registry key or value, such as <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/regprov/registrykeychangeevent"><strong>RegistryKeyChangeEvent</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The following topics supply information about securing delivery of events for providers and receiving events securely for client scripts and applications:</p>

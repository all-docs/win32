<h1>WMI Tasks: Printers and Printing</h1>
<p>WMI tasks for printers and printing manage and obtain data about printers, such as finding or setting the default printer. For other examples, see the TechNet ScriptCenter at <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/default.aspx">https://www.microsoft.com/technet</a>.</p>
<p>The script examples shown in this topic obtain data only from the local computer. For more information about how to use the script to obtain data from remote computers, see <a href="connecting-to-wmi-on-a-remote-computer.html">Connecting to WMI on a Remote Computer</a>.</p>
<p>The following procedure describes how to run a script.</p>
<p><strong>To run a script</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the code and save it in a file with a .vbs extension, such as <em>filename.vbs</em>. Ensure that your text editor does not add a .txt extension to the file.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt window and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.</li>
<li>Type <strong>cscript filename.vbs</strong> at the command prompt.</li>
<li>If you cannot access an event log, check to see if you are running from an Elevated command prompt. Some Event Log, such as the Security Event Log, may be protected by User Access Controls (UAC).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
By default, cscript displays the output of a script in the command prompt window. Because WMI scripts can produce large amounts of output, you might want to redirect the output to a file. Type <strong>cscript filename.vbs &gt; outfile.txt</strong> at the command prompt to redirect the output of the <em>filename.vbs</em> script to <em>outfile.txt</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following table lists script examples that can be used to obtain various types of data from the local computer.</p>

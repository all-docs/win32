<h1>Timer Algorithm Counter Types</h1>
<p>Timer algorithm counter types are based on the amount of increased use of the performance object over a sample period. The counter data is an increasing quantum measure of the total activity for an object up to the time that the sample takes place. The difference between the two samples indicates the total time that the object is active during the sample time period.</p>
<p>Dividing by the sample period results in a proportion of time that the object is active during a time period. Dividing by the number of internal polling interrupts determines the average use between polling samples.</p>
<p>For example, the <strong>AvgDiskSecPerRead</strong> property in the <a href="/previous-versions//aa394308(v=vs.85)"><strong>Win32_PerfRawData_PerfDisk_PhysicalDisk</strong></a> class uses the <strong>PERF_AVERAGE_TIMER</strong> countertype. It calculates the average time in seconds of a read of data from the disk, and requires the base property <strong>AvgDiskSecPerRead_Base</strong>. Unlike <strong>PERF_COUNTER_TIMER</strong>, the average timer base represents an accumulating number of operations, and the counter data is a running time value, which means that when divided by the time base, it yields the total time of all operations in seconds.</p>

<h1>Securing C++ Clients and Providers</h1>
<p>Both C++ providers and client applications must perform many of the same operations to maintain WMI security.</p>
<p>Client applications must set DCOM <a href="setting-the-default-process-security-level-using-c-.html">impersonation</a> and <a href="setting-authentication-in-wmi.html">authentication</a> levels correctly when connecting to WMI. Callbacks from <a href="setting-security-on-an-asynchronous-call.html">asynchronous calls</a> have security risks, so client applications must <a href="performing-access-checks.html">perform access checks</a> to ensure the callback is from a trusted source. Clients need to secure both <a href="securing-wmi-events.html">temporary and permanent event consumers</a>.</p>
<p>A provider may <a href="performing-access-checks.html">perform access checks</a> to ensure that the resources it creates are only accessed by appropriate clients.</p>
<p>Both providers and clients also can set the security on a <a href="setting-the-security-on-iwbemservices-and-other-proxies.html">specific proxy</a> connection. Both can also enable <a href="executing-privileged-operations.html">privileges</a>. An event provider must ensure that the client consumer has privileges to <a href="providing-events-securely.html">receive a requested event</a>.</p>
<p>Either a client or provider may need to make a remote connection that requires a different authentication service, NTLM instead of Kerberos for example.</p>

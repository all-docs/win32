<h1>WMI Classes</h1>
<p>This section provides WMI class and reference page information. For more information about how to retrieve class or instance data, see <a href="manipulating-class-and-instance-information.html">Manipulating Class and Instance Information</a>. The following list lists, describes, and provides links to specific WMI class information. For more information and script code examples of using WMI classes to obtain a variety of operating system and hardware data, see <a href="wmi-tasks-for-scripts-and-applications.html">WMI Tasks for Scripts and Applications</a>. For examples in C++, see <a href="wmi-c---application-examples.html">WMI C++ Application Examples</a>. <a href="connecting-to-wmi-on-a-remote-computer.html">Connecting to WMI on a Remote Computer</a> shows how to obtain remote data. You can also use PowerShell do access WMI objects; for a list of WMI classes that include PowerShell code samples, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tags-cloud.aspx?tag=powershell+code+wmi">here</a>.</p>

<td>Predefined classes that are included in every namespace in the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) core. You can recognize a WMI system class because the name begins with a double underscore (__). These classes provide much of the basic functionality for WMI. The WMI system classes are similar in purpose to the system tables in SQL server.</td>

<td>Other Microsoft classes that offer the means to manipulate several operating system features, such as remote events and policy extensions. The <a href="wmi-troubleshooting.html">WMI Troubleshooting</a> classes are MSFT classes that provide data about WMI operations.</td>

<td><a href="cimclas.html">CIM Classes</a></td>
<td><a href="gloss-c.html"><em>Common Information Model (CIM)</em></a> schema classes. If you want to write your own WMI classes then you can inherit from one or more of these classes. The WMI <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-provider">Win32 Classes</a> inherit from the CIM classes.</td>

<h2>Naming Conventions for WMI Classes and Properties</h2>
<p>Property names must conform to the Managed Object Format (MOF) syntax defined by the Distributed Management Task Force (DTMF). The initial identifier characters must be from the letters a through z and the underscore character (_). All additional characters must be from the letters a through z, the underscore character, and the numerals 0 through 9. For more information, see the Unicode Usage section of the <a href="https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim">CIM Specification Version 2.2</a>.</p>
<p>SQL reserve words should not be used in class and property names. For a complete list of the SQL reserve words and for more information, see the Guidelines section of the <a href="https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim">CIM Specification Version 2.2</a>.</p>
<h2>Document Conventions for a WMI Class Reference Page</h2>
<p>This section identifies and describes the document conventions for a WMI class reference page.</p>
<p>A typical reference page contains a syntax block, methods table, and a properties list.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Syntax block</p>
<p>A simplified version of MOF code that includes the class name, parent class (if any), and class properties, in alphabetical order, with data types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Methods table</p>
<p>If a class has methods, the methods are listed in the table immediately following the syntax block. Each implemented method is linked to a reference page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properties list</p>
<p>Each class property is listed with a data type, access type (read-only or read/write), qualifiers, and a description of the property.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Syntax block</h2>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>class Win32_xyz : CIM_xyz 
{
  uint16 abc  ;
  string def  ;
};
</code></pre>
<h2>Methods table</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Win32_xyz methods</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><em>SomeMethod</em></td>
<td>Brief description of what the method does.</td>

<h2>Properties list</h2>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->abc</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Data type: <strong>uint16</strong></p>
<p>Access type: Shows whether you have read/write or read-only access to this property.</p>
<p>Qualifiers: If present, shows the qualifiers for the property. For example, <strong>Key</strong>, <strong>Override</strong>.</p>
<p>Describes the property and provides inheritance information for the property. For example, this property is inherited from <strong>CIM_<em>xyz</em></strong>. There is a link to the parent class if Microsoft provides an implementation of that class. However, the CIM classes are not available.</p>

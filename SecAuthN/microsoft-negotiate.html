<h1>Microsoft Negotiate</h1>
<p>Microsoft Negotiate is a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security support provider</em></a> (SSP) that acts as an application layer between <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>Security Support Provider Interface</em></a> (<a href="sspi.html">SSPI</a>) and the other SSPs. When an app calls into SSPI to sign-in a network, it can specify an SSP to process the request. If the app specifies Negotiate, Negotiate analyzes the request and picks the best SSP to handle the request based on customer-configured security policy.</p>
<p>Currently, the Negotiate security package selects between <a href="microsoft-kerberos.html">Kerberos</a> and <a href="microsoft-ntlm.html">NTLM</a>. Negotiate selects Kerberos unless one of the following conditions applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can't be used by one of the systems involved in the authentication.</li>
<li>The calling app didn't provide sufficient information to use Kerberos.</li>
</ul>
<p>To allow Negotiate to select the <a href="microsoft-kerberos.html">Kerberos</a> security provider, the client app must provide one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>service principal name</em></a> (SPN).</li>
<li>A user principal name (UPN).</li>
<li>A NetBIOS account name as the target name.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, Negotiate always selects the <a href="microsoft-ntlm.html">NTLM</a> security provider.</p>
<p>A server that uses the Negotiate package is able to respond to client apps that specifically select either the <a href="microsoft-kerberos.html">Kerberos</a> or <a href="microsoft-ntlm.html">NTLM</a> security provider. However, a client app must know that a server supports the Negotiate package to request authentication using Negotiate. A server that doesn't support Negotiate can't always respond to requests from clients that specify Negotiate as the SSP.</p>
<h2>Reasons to Use the Negotiate Package</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allows the system to use the most secure available protocol.</li>
<li>Ensures forward compatibility for the app.</li>
<li>Ensures that the app exhibits behavior that is in accordance with the security policy set by the customer.</li>
</ul>

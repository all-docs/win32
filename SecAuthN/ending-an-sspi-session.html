<h1>Ending an SSPI Session</h1>
<p>After the client and server have finished communicating, both sides call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Sspi/nf-sspi-deletesecuritycontext"><strong>DeleteSecurityContext</strong></a> function with their respective context handles. When the client has finished communicating with any server or has finished using the additional credentials passed to the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-acquirecredentialshandlea"><strong>AcquireCredentialsHandle</strong></a> function, the client must call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Sspi/nf-sspi-freecredentialshandle"><strong>FreeCredentialsHandle</strong></a> function. When the server is ready to shut down and before unloading the DLL, the server must call <strong>DeleteSecurityContext</strong>.</p>

<h1>Schannel Credentials</h1>
<p>Schannel protocols require credentials to authenticate servers and optionally, clients. Server authentication, where the server provides proof of its identity to the client, is required by the Schannel <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security protocols</em></a>. Client authentication may be requested by the server at any time.</p>
<p>Schannel credentials are <a href="../secgloss/x-gly.html"><em>X.509</em></a> certificates. <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>Public</em></a> and <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>private key</em></a> information from certificates is used to authenticate the server and optionally, the client. These keys are also used to provide message <a href="../secgloss/i-gly.html"><em>integrity</em></a> while client and server exchange the information required to generate and exchange <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>session keys</em></a>.</p>

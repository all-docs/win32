<p>For time-outs and logoffs, Winlogon will close the dialog box after the message has been sent. This message is sent so the dialog box operation can respond in a useful manner (for example, by closing itself down if a logoff has occurred).</p>
<p>For input time-outs, the dialog box is closed with the code WLX_DLG_INPUT_TIMEOUT.</p>
<p>For screen saver time-outs, the dialog box is closed with the code WLX_DLG_SCREEN_SAVER_TIMEOUT.</p>
<p>For logoffs, the dialog box operation is closed with the code WLX_DLG_USER_LOGOFF.</p>

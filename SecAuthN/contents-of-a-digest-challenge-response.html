<h1>Contents of a Digest Challenge Response</h1>
<p>The client must send the server a Digest challenge response when it receives a Digest challenge in response to a request for a resource. The client must send the request again, supplying an Authorization header with the challenge response. The following table describes the directives that make up a Digest challenge response.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Directive</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>username</td>
<td>The account name of the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security principal</em></a> requesting the resource.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Realm</td>
<td>The name of the domain that contains the account indicated by username.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nonce</td>
<td>The nonce received in the Digest challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>uri</td>
<td>The Universal Resource Identifier (URI) of the requested resource.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>qop</td>
<td>The <a href="quality-of-protection.html">quality of protection</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nc</td>
<td>The nonce count. The number of times the client has sent a challenge response using the nonce. For more information, see the nonce directive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cnonce</td>
<td>A unique encoded value generated by the client for each challenge response.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>response</td>
<td>A value computed according to the Digest Access specification (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt">RFC 2617</a>). An accurate response is conclusive proof that the user's password is known on the client side.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>algorithm</td>
<td>The algorithm received in the Digest challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>opaque</td>
<td>The opaque value received in the Digest challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(SASL only) cipher</td>
<td>One of the cipher values received in the Digest challenge. For cipher details, see <a href="quality-of-protection-and-ciphers.html">Quality of Protection and Ciphers</a>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>Microsoft Digest supports the following username/Realm forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username Realm</li>
<li>AccountName Domain (flat)</li>
<li>UPN &quot;&quot; (blank)</li>
<li>NetBIOS &quot;&quot; (blank)</li>
</ul>
<p>While uppercase characters are supported, for best performance matching the server's precalculated Digest hash values, the use of lowercase characters is recommended.</p>
<p>The use of precalculated hashes is a new feature that allows system operators to skip the use of reversible encrypted passwords on the domain controller. A precalculated hash is formed for a user when the user's password is changed.</p>
<p>Microsoft Digest generates the Digest challenge response string for client applications. For details, see <a href="generating-the-digest-challenge-response.html">Generating the Digest Challenge Response</a>.</p>

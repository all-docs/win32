<h1>Smart Card Readers</h1>
<p>Readers are standard devices in a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card</em></a> system. They are controlled through drivers, and are introduced to and removed from the system through Plug and Play or through the Control Panel Devices item.</p>
<p>Each reader must be defined for use by the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card subsystem</em></a>. The subsystem is not responsible for any reader not specifically given to it.</p>
<p>Smart card readers can be divided into logical groups called reader groups. These groups can be defined by the subsystem, as well as defined by administrators and users. A reader can belong to more than one reader group</p>
<p>The smart card subsystem defines the following groups.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Group</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>SCard$AllReaders</td>
<td>This group contains all the readers in the system. A new reader given to the smart card subsystem is automatically included in the system-wide reader group, SCard$AllReaders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SCard$DefaultReaders</td>
<td>This default group, one for each <a href="../secgloss/t-gly.html"><em>terminal</em></a>, contains all the readers assigned to the terminal that are not reserved for specific use.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

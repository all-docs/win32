<h1>Registering to Receive Connection Notifications</h1>
<p>After you have created a DLL to receive connection notifications, you must register it with the system. You do this by adding a <strong>REG_EXPAND_SZ</strong> value under the</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>SYSTEM</strong>\<strong>CurrentControlSet</strong>\<strong>Control</strong>\<strong>NetworkProvider</strong>\<strong>Notifyees</strong></p>
<p>key. This value specifies the path to the DLL that implements the <a href="connection-notification-api.html">Connection Notification API</a>.</p>
<p>The value can have any name. All values under the <strong>Notifyees</strong> key are treated as paths to DLLs that are notified of connection events. It is recommended that you use a name that identifies your DLL. This lessens the chance of a name conflict with other connection notification applications.</p>
<p>For more information about how to create an application that receives connection notifications, see <a href="receiving-connection-notifications.html">Receiving Connection Notifications</a>.</p>

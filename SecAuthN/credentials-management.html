<h1>Credentials Management</h1>
<p>Developers who write for Windows can use the Credentials Management API including Credentials Management User Interface (UI) functions to obtain and manage credential information such as user names and passwords. These functions request Windows account information to be used instead of the credentials established while logging on. Such requests typically occur when the logon credentials do not have permissions that are required by the application.</p>
<p>The Credentials Management UI functions provide interfaces with the appearance of the Windows user interface. These functions include customizable options that add user's information to the user's credentials store.</p>
<p>The following topics provide more information about the Credentials Management API:</p>

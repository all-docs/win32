<h1>Winlogon and GINA</h1>
<p><a href="../secgloss/w-gly.html"><em>Winlogon</em></a>, the <a href="../secgloss/g-gly.html"><em>GINA</em></a>, and network providers are the parts of the interactive logon model. The interactive logon procedure is normally controlled by Winlogon, MSGina.dll, and network providers. To change the interactive logon procedure, MSGina.dll can be replaced with a customized GINA DLL.</p>
<p>To work with Winlogon, the GINA, and network providers, you should have a firm knowledge of the Windows security architecture, especially with regard to <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>tokens</em></a>, <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication packages</em></a>, and related matters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
GINA DLLs are ignored in WindowsÂ Vista.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>For information about specific functions and structures, see <a href="authentication-reference.html">Authentication Reference</a>. This reference section includes descriptions of the functions that a GINA DLL must implement, the Winlogon support functions that the GINA DLL can call, and the data structures used to pass information between Winlogon and the GINA.</p>
<p>Sample GINA code can be found in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) Security samples. The samples contain C code for implementing a GINA stub and a GINA hook. For more information about custom GINA DLL development, send an email message to: <a href="mailto:ginareqs@microsoft.com">ginareqs@microsoft.com</a>.</p>
<p>For information about the authentication model supported by Windows and for details about the <a href="../secgloss/l-gly.html"><em>Local Security Authority</em></a> (LSA) services and <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication package</em></a> interfaces, see <a href="lsa-authentication.html">LSA Authentication</a>.</p>
<p>For information about the aspects of the Local Security Authority that relate to the administration of security policy, which includes trust relationships with other computers and domains, assignment of privileges, audit generation control, system accessibility, and other similar topics, see <a href="../secmgmt/lsa-policy.html">LSA Policy</a>.</p>

<h1>Server Continuation</h1>
<p>Based on the return code from a previous call to <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-acceptsecuritycontext"><strong>AcceptSecurityContext (General)</strong></a>, the server can wait for a response from the client and can participate in additional exchanges with the client. To continue the authentication protocol, the server repeats calls to <strong>AcceptSecurityContext (General)</strong>.</p>
<p>The status returned by <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-acceptsecuritycontext"><strong>AcceptSecurityContext (General)</strong></a> is checked to see if the server needs to wait for additional messages from the client. In most authentication protocols, there is a maximum number of exchanges even for mutual authentication. Currently, both the NTLM and <a href="../secgloss/k-gly.html"><em>Kerberos protocols</em></a> do mutual authentication with three exchanges.</p>

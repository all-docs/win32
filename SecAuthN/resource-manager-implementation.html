<h1>Resource Manager Implementation</h1>
<p>The <a href="../secgloss/r-gly.html"><em>resource manager</em></a> runs as a trusted service in a single process. All requests for <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card</em></a> access are made to the resource manager, which routes them to the <a href="../secgloss/r-gly.html"><em>reader</em></a> that contains the targeted card.</p>
<p>Smart cards are often used in conjunction with security and personal privacy. Wherever possible, the resource manager uses the security mechanisms existing within the underlying operating system when accessing a reader or smart card.</p>

<h1>Creating Custom Security Packages</h1>
<h2>SSP Security Packages</h2>
<p>If a custom security support provider (SSP) security package will be used exclusively for client/server security support it can implement the Microsoft <a href="sspi.html">Security Support Provider Interface</a>.</p>
<p>The SampSSP sample shipped with the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) contains a sample SSP security package implementation.</p>
<h2>SSP/AP Security Packages</h2>
<p>Custom <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security support provider</em></a>/<a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>authentication packages</em></a> (SSP/APs) contain security packages that function as authentication packages (APs) and security support providers (SSPs). These packages implement separate APIs to support each role.</p>
<p>Because it functions as an AP, a custom SSP/AP <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security package</em></a> must provide implementations for all of the <a href="authentication-functions.html">Functions Implemented by Authentication Packages</a>.</p>
<p>To provide integrated security support, a custom SSP/AP security package must provide implementations for the <a href="authentication-functions.html">Functions implemented by SSP/APs</a>. <a href="authentication-functions.html">LSA Functions Called by SSP/APs</a> describes the support functions available to the SSP/AP developers that want to interact with the LSA.</p>
<p>SSP/AP security packages, in order to perform as both an AP and an SSP, may execute as part of the operating system and as part of a user application. These two modes of execution are known as LSA mode and user mode, respectively. For details about custom security packages in LSA mode see <a href="lsa-mode-initialization.html">LSA Mode Initialization</a>. For details about user mode, see <a href="user-mode-initialization.html">User Mode Initialization</a>.</p>
<p>If a custom SSP/AP security package offers services for client/server applications it should provide implementations for the functions described in <a href="authentication-functions.html">Functions Implemented by User-mode SSP/APs</a>. <a href="authentication-functions.html">LSA Functions Called By User-mode SSP/APs</a> describes the support functions available to an SSP/AP executing in a client or server process.</p>
<p>For information about registering an SSP/AP DLL, see <a href="registering-ssp-ap-dlls.html">Registering SSP/AP DLLs</a>.</p>

<h1>Writing and Installing a Security Support Provider</h1>
<p>The design of SSPI enables additional SSPs to be written and added to the system. An <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>SSP</em></a> specific to a security model can be developed with relative ease or great complexity, depending on the level of integration with the operating system. A client SSP that allows connections to a new type of server could be developed very quickly, whereas a full SSP that provides local impersonation would require more effort.</p>
<p>SSPs are installed by updating a <strong>REG_SZ</strong> value in the registry, located as follows:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>System</strong>\<strong>CurrentControlSet</strong>\<strong>Control</strong>\ Â Â Â <strong>SecurityProviders</strong> = *Provider1.dll, Provider2.dll,*â€¦<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Data type</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A single DLL can contain multiple SSPs.</p>

title: InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel) function (Sspi.h)
ms.topic: reference
ms.date: 03/15/2023</h2>
<h1>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel) function</h1>
<p>The <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> function initiates the client-side, outbound <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a> from a credential handle. The function is used to build a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a> between the client application and a remote peer. <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> returns a token that the client must pass to the remote peer, which the peer in turn submits to the local security implementation through the <a href="acceptsecuritycontext--schannel.html">AcceptSecurityContext (Schannel)</a> call. The token generated should be considered opaque by all callers.</p>
<p>Typically, the <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> function is called in a loop until a sufficient <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a> is established.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre lang="C++"><code>SECURITY_STATUS SEC_Entry InitializeSecurityContext(
  _In_opt_    PCredHandle    phCredential,
  _In_opt_    PCtxtHandle    phContext,
  _In_opt_    SEC_CHAR       *pszTargetName,
  _In_        ULONG          fContextReq,
  _In_        ULONG          Reserved1,
  _In_        ULONG          TargetDataRep,
  _In_opt_    PSecBufferDesc pInput,
  _In_        ULONG          Reserved2,
  _Inout_opt_ PCtxtHandle    phNewContext,
  _Inout_opt_ PSecBufferDesc pOutput,
  _Out_       PULONG         pfContextAttr,
  _Out_opt_   PTimeStamp     ptsExpiry
);
</code></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p><em>phCredential</em> <code>[in, optional]</code></p>
<p>A handle to the credentials returned by <a href="acquirecredentialshandle--schannel.html">AcquireCredentialsHandle (Schannel)</a>. This handle is used to build the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a>. The <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> function requires at least OUTBOUND credentials on the first call. On subsequent calls, this can be <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p><em>phContext</em> <code>[in, optional]</code></p>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="sspi-handles.html">CtxtHandle</a> structure. On the first call to <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong>, this pointer is <code>NULL</code>. On future calls, this parameter is a pointer to the handle to the partially formed context returned in the <em>phNewContext</em> parameter by the first call to this function.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!WARNING]
Do not use the same context handle in concurrent calls to <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong>. The API implementation in the security service providers is not thread-safe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>pszTargetName</em> <code>[in, optional]</code></p>
<p>A pointer to a null-terminated string that uniquely identifies the target server. Schannel uses this value to verify the server certificate. Schannel also uses this value to locate the session in the session cache when reestablishing a connection. The cached session is used only if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The target name is the same.</li>
<li>The cache entry has not expired.</li>
<li>The application process that calls the function is the same.</li>
<li>The logon session is the same.</li>
<li>The credential handle is the same.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>fContextReq</em> <code>[in]</code></p>
<p>Bit flags that indicate requests for the context. Not all packages can support all requirements. Flags used for this parameter are prefixed with ISC_REQ_, for example, ISC_REQ_DELEGATE. This parameter can be one or more of the following attributes flags.</p>

<p>The requested attributes may not be supported by the client. For more information, see the <em>pfContextAttr</em> parameter.</p>
<p>For further descriptions of the various attributes, see <a href="context-requirements.html">Context Requirements</a>.</p>
<p><em>Reserved1</em> <code>[in]</code></p>
<p>This parameter is reserved and must be set to zero.</p>
<p><em>TargetDataRep</em> <code>[in]</code></p>
<p>This parameter is not used with Schannel. Set it to zero.</p>
<p><em>pInput</em> <code>[in, optional]</code></p>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/ns-sspi-secbufferdesc">SecBufferDesc</a> structure that contains pointers to the buffers supplied as input to the package. Unless the client context was initiated by the server, the value of this parameter must be <code>NULL</code> on the first call to the function. On subsequent calls to the function or when the client context was initiated by the server, the value of this parameter is a pointer to a buffer allocated with enough memory to hold the token returned by the remote computer.</p>
<p>On calls to this function after the initial call, there must be two buffers. The first has type <strong>SECBUFFER_TOKEN</strong> and contains the token received from the server. The second buffer has type <strong>SECBUFFER_EMPTY</strong>; set both the <strong>pvBuffer</strong> and <strong>cbBuffer</strong> members to zero.</p>
<p><em>Reserved2</em> <code>[in]</code></p>
<p>This parameter is reserved and must be set to zero.</p>
<p><em>phNewContext</em> <code>[in, out, optional]</code></p>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="sspi-handles.html">CtxtHandle</a> structure. On the first call to <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong>, this pointer receives the new context handle. On the second call, <em>phNewContext</em> can be the same as the handle specified in the <em>phContext</em> parameter. <em>phNewContext</em> should never be <code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p><em>pOutput</em> <code>[in, out, optional]</code></p>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/ns-sspi-secbufferdesc">SecBufferDesc</a> structure that contains pointers to the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/ns-sspi-secbuffer">SecBuffer</a> structure that receives the output data. If a buffer was typed as SEC_READWRITE in the input, it will be there on output. The system will allocate a buffer for the security token if requested (through ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY) and fill in the address in the buffer descriptor for the security token.</p>
<p>If the ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY flag is specified, the Schannel SSP will allocate memory for the buffer and put the appropriate information in the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/ns-sspi-secbufferdesc">SecBufferDesc</a>. In addition, the caller must pass in a buffer of type <strong>SECBUFFER_ALERT</strong>. On output, if an alert is generated, this buffer contains information about that alert, and the function fails.</p>
<p><em>pfContextAttr</em> <code>[out]</code></p>
<p>A pointer to a variable to receive a set of bit flags that indicate the <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.md#_security_attribute_gly">attributes</a> of the established context. For a description of the various attributes, see <a href="context-requirements.html">Context Requirements</a>.</p>
<p>Flags used for this parameter are prefixed with ISC_RET, such as ISC_RET_DELEGATE. For a list of valid values, see the <em>fContextReq</em> parameter.</p>
<p>Do not check for security-related attributes until the final function call returns successfully. Attribute flags that are not related to security, such as the ASC_RET_ALLOCATED_MEMORY flag, can be checked before the final return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Particular context attributes can change during negotiation with a remote peer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>ptsExpiry</em> <code>[out, optional]</code></p>
<p>A pointer to a <a href="timestamp.html">TimeStamp</a> structure that receives the expiration time of the context. It is recommended that the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security package</a> always return this value in local time. This parameter is optional and <code>NULL</code> should be passed for short-lived clients.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The caller is responsible for determining whether the final context attributes are sufficient. If, for example, confidentiality was requested, but could not be established, some applications may choose to shut down the connection immediately.</p>
<p>If attributes of the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a> are not sufficient, the client must free the partially created context by calling the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-deletesecuritycontext">DeleteSecurityContext</a> function.</p>
<p>The <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> function is used by a client to initialize an outbound context.</p>
<p>For a two-leg <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a>, the calling sequence is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client calls the function with <em>phContext</em> set to <code>NULL</code> and fills in the buffer descriptor with the input message.</li>
<li>The <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security package</a> examines the parameters and constructs an opaque token, placing it in the TOKEN element in the buffer array. If the <em>fContextReq</em> parameter includes the ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY flag, the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security package</a> allocates the memory and returns the pointer in the TOKEN element.</li>
<li>The client sends the token returned in the <em>pOutput</em> buffer to the target server. The server then passes the token as an input argument in a call to the <a href="acceptsecuritycontext--schannel.html">AcceptSecurityContext (Schannel)</a> function.</li>
<li><a href="acceptsecuritycontext--schannel.html">AcceptSecurityContext (Schannel)</a> may return a token, which the server sends to the client for a second call to <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> if the first call returned SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED.</li>
</ol>
<p>For multiple-leg <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a>s, such as mutual authentication, the calling sequence is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client calls the function as described earlier, but the package returns the SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED success code.</li>
<li>The client sends the output token to the server and waits for the server's reply.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of the server's response, the client calls <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> again, with <em>phContext</em> set to the handle that was returned from the last call. The token received from the server is supplied in the <em>pInput</em> parameter.</li>
<li>Do not use the <em>phContext</em> value in concurrent calls to <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong>. The implementation in the security providers is not thread-safe.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the server has successfully responded, the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security package</a> returns SEC_E_OK and a secure session is established.</p>
<p>If the function returns one of the error responses, the server's response is not accepted, and the session is not established.</p>
<p>If the function returns SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED, SEC_I_COMPLETE_NEEDED, or SEC_I_COMPLETE_AND_CONTINUE, steps 2 and 3 are repeated.</p>
<p>To initialize a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security context</a>, more than one call to this function may be required, depending on the underlying authentication mechanism as well as the choices specified in the <em>fContextReq</em> parameter.</p>
<p>The <em>fContextReq</em> and <em>pfContextAttributes</em> parameters are bitmasks that represent various context attributes. For a description of the various attributes, see <a href="context-requirements.html">Context Requirements</a>. The <em>pfContextAttributes</em> parameter is valid on any successful return, but only on the final successful return should you examine the flags that pertain to security aspects of the context. Intermediate returns can set, for example, the ISC_RET_ALLOCATED_MEMORY flag.</p>
<p>If the ISC_REQ_USE_SUPPLIED_CREDS flag is set, the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security package</a> must look for a SECBUFFER_PKG_PARAMS buffer type in the <em>pInput</em> input buffer. This is not a generic solution, but it allows for a strong pairing of <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security package</a> and application when appropriate.</p>
<p>If ISC_REQ_ALLOCATE_MEMORY was specified, the caller must free the memory by calling the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-freecontextbuffer">FreeContextBuffer</a> function.</p>
<p>For example, the input token could be the challenge from a LAN Manager. In this case, the output token would be the NTLM-encrypted response to the challenge.</p>
<p>The action the client takes depends on the return code from this function. If the return code is SEC_E_OK, there will be no second <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> call, and no response from the server is expected. If the return code is SEC_I_CONTINUE_NEEDED, the client expects a token in response from the server and passes it in a second call to <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong>. The SEC_I_COMPLETE_NEEDED return code indicates that the client must finish building the message and call the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-completeauthtoken">CompleteAuthToken</a> function. The SEC_I_COMPLETE_AND_CONTINUE code incorporates both of these actions.</p>
<p>If <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> returns success on the first (or only) call, then the caller must eventually call the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-deletesecuritycontext">DeleteSecurityContext</a> function on the returned handle, even if the call fails on a later leg of the authentication exchange.</p>
<p>The client may call <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> again after it has completed successfully. This indicates to the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html">security package</a> that a reauthentication is wanted.</p>
<p>Kernel mode callers have the following differences: the target name is a <a href="../secgloss/u-gly.html">Unicode</a> string that must be allocated in virtual memory by using <a href="/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc">VirtualAlloc</a>; it must not be allocated from the pool. Buffers passed and supplied in <em>pInput</em> and <em>pOutput</em> must be in virtual memory, not in the pool.</p>
<p>If the function returns SEC_I_INCOMPLETE_CREDENTIALS, check that you specified a valid and trusted certificate in your credentials. The certificate is specified when calling the <a href="acquirecredentialshandle--schannel.html">AcquireCredentialsHandle (Schannel)</a> function. The certificate must be a client authentication certificate issued by a certification authority (CA) trusted by the server. To obtain a list of the CAs trusted by the server, call the <a href="querycontextattributes--schannel.html">QueryContextAttributes (Schannel)</a> function and specify the SECPKG_ATTR_ISSUER_LIST_EX attribute.</p>
<p>After a client application receives an authentication certificate from a CA that is trusted by the server, the application creates a new credential by calling the <a href="acquirecredentialshandle--schannel.html">AcquireCredentialsHandle (Schannel)</a> function and then calling <strong>InitializeSecurityContext (Schannel)</strong> again, specifying the new credential in the <em>phCredential</em> parameter.</p>

<h1>Security Support Provider/Authentication Packages</h1>
<p>The Windows operating system supports authentication using <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security packages</em></a> that function as both <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security support providers</em></a> and as <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication packages</em></a>. Security packages provide the logon process support services of a Windows authentication package and also provide authentication services to applications by implementing a set of functions that are mapped to the <a href="sspi.html">Security Support Provider Interface</a> (SSPI).</p>
<p>A security package that functions as an authentication package and implements the functionality required by <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>SSPI</em></a> is called a security support provider/authentication package (SSP/AP).</p>
<p>For more information about security packages, see <a href="ssp-packages-provided-by-microsoft.html">SSP Packages Provided by Microsoft</a>. For information about developing custom SSP/APs, see <a href="custom-security-packages.html">Custom Security Packages</a>.</p>

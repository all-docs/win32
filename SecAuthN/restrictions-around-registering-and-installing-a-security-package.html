<h1>Restrictions around Registering and Installing a Security Package</h1>
<p>The removal, replacement, or wrapping of inbox Security Packages (for example, Kerberos or NTLM) is not a supported action in Windows, and as of January 10, 2017, it is prevented. Third party Security Packages (SSPs/APs) can be added; however, Windows does not support the removal of preconfigured SSPs/APs. Specifically, editing the <strong>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages</strong> registry setting has never been supported.</p>
<p>Starting in WindowsÂ 8.1, customers who want to provide additional functionality can add their Security Packages using the registry setting <strong>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages</strong> (<a href="registering-ssp-ap-dlls.html">Registering SSP/AP DLLs</a>) and the associated registry setting <strong>SecurityProviders</strong> (<a href="writing-and-installing-a-security-support-provider.html">Writing and Installing a Security Support Provider</a>), if applicable. Furthermore, the purpose of <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.md#_security_security_package_gly">Security Packages</a> is to implement new <em>security protocols</em> which can be in the form of a security support provider (SSP) or an <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.md#_security_authentication_package_gly">authentication package</a> (AP). The purpose of an SSP is to provide <em>authenticated connection</em>, <em>message integrity</em>, and <em>message encryption services</em> that are not already supported in the system, while an AP is used to add new <em>authentication logic</em> used to determine whether to permit a user to log on.</p>
<p>Microsoft is invested in customer security, and is trying to ensure that critical processes such as SSPs and APs are not easily removable from the system. Hence, the <strong>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages</strong> registry setting was restricted starting in WindowsÂ 8.1 in order to prevent changes to it. In order to facilitate third party Security Packages, <strong>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages</strong> was made the designated setting for custom SSPs/APs. It is further recommended that any functionality in custom SSPs/APs that is outside the scope of Security Packages defined by Microsoft be removed from such custom SSPs/APs, and that inbox Security Packages are not removed by any product.</p>

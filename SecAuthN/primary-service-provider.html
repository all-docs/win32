<h1>Primary Service Provider</h1>
<p>Each <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card</em></a> known to the system may have a registered COM interface listed as its primary service provider. When you access a <em>smart card</em> through COM, this <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>primary service provider</em></a> supplies the control interfaces to the card. This allows card services to be exposed to a wide range of programming environments, including Java and the Microsoft Visual Basic development system.</p>

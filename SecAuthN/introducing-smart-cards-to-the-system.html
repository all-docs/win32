<h1>Introducing Smart Cards to the System</h1>
<p>Before the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card subsystem</em></a> can find a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card</em></a>, the smart card must be introduced to the system. This is typically done with a smart card setup tool provided by the card manufacturer. The tool could come as a program on a floppy disk (with the smart card), an ActiveX control available on a website, and so on.</p>
<p>The setup tool must provide the following pieces of information about the card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>ATR string</em></a>, and an optional mask to use as an aid in identifying the card.</li>
<li>A list of smart card interfaces supported by the card.</li>
<li>A display name for the card, to be used in identifying the card to the user. In most cases, the user will supply this to the setup tool.</li>
<li>The <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>primary service provider</em></a> associated with the card (optional), to be used when accessing the card through COM interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify setup tools, and to ensure the integrity of the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>smart card database</em></a>, the smart card subsystem provides the following two functions. <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winscard/nf-winscard-scardintroducecardtypea"><strong>SCardIntroduceCardType</strong></a> introduces a smart card into the database and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winscard/nf-winscard-scardforgetcardtypea"><strong>SCardForgetCardType</strong></a> removes it from the database.</p>

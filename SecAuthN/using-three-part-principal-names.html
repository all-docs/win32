<h1>Using Three Part Principal Names</h1>
<p>When creating a security support provider (SSP) security package, you should not allow the domain joined client to authenticate to a domain controller by using a two part service provider name (SPN) of the following form.</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>A client should always authenticate by specifying the domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>A domain joined client that logs on with a two part SPN may be able to impersonate the domain controller. If you allow two part SPNs, you should create a log entry that contains enough information to enable the administrator to identify the caller.</p>

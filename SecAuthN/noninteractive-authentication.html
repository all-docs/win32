<h1>Noninteractive Authentication</h1>
<p>Noninteractive authentication can only be used after an <a href="interactive-authentication.html">interactive authentication</a> has taken place. During noninteractive authentication, the user does not input <a href="../secgloss/l-gly.html"><em>logon data</em></a>, instead, previously established <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>credentials</em></a> are used.</p>
<p>Noninteractive authentication is performed when an application uses the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>Security Support Provider Interface</em></a> (SSPI) and a security package to establish a secure network connection. Noninteractive authentication is the mechanism at work when a user connects to multiple machines on a network without having to re-enter logon information for each machine. For example, if an application needs to open a secure folder on a remote machine and the application user is already interactively logged on to a domain account, the application does not require the user to supply logon data again. Instead, the application can request a noninteractive authentication by using SSPI to pass the previously established security information to a security package. The security package then uses LSA functions to check the <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>credentials</em></a>. The following diagram illustrates this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="images/lsasspi2.png" alt="noninteractive authentication" /></p>
<p>In the preceding diagram, the client application initiates a call to SSPI to request an authenticated network connection. SSPI passes the client's request to a security package for processing. The security package authenticates the user by calling the <a href="../secgloss/l-gly.html"><em>Local Security Authority</em></a> (LSA) and specifying an <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication package</em></a> and providing the user's existing credentials.</p>
<p>The authentication result is passed from the <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication package</em></a>, through the LSA, to the <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security package</em></a>, and finally to SSPI. SSPI notifies the client application about the outcome of the request.</p>
<p>For more information about SSPI, see <a href="sspi.html">Security Support Provider Interface</a>.</p>

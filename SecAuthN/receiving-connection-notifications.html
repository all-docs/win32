<h1>Receiving Connection Notifications</h1>
<p>Some applications need to receive notification of connection events, either before the event, just after it occurs, or both. You can create a DLL to receive advance and after-the-fact notification of connection events.</p>
<p>An example of an application that needs to receive advance notification of a connection event is the Remote Access Service (RAS). RAS needs to be informed before a connection is made because it may be necessary to establish a modem connection before making the network connection.</p>
<p>Similarly, applications may need to clean up resources after the connection is made, therefore requiring a post-connection notification.</p>
<p>Applications interested in receiving advance and after-the-fact notification of connection events must supply a DLL that exports two functions, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Npapi/nf-npapi-addconnectnotify"><strong>AddConnectNotify</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Npapi/nf-npapi-cancelconnectnotify"><strong>CancelConnectNotify</strong></a>.</p>
<p>After you implement these functions, you must register your DLL as described in <a href="registering-to-receive-connection-notifications.html">Registering to Receive Connection Notifications</a>.</p>

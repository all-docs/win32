<h1>Registering SSP/AP DLLs</h1>
<p>After developing a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security support provider</em></a>/<a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication package</em></a> dynamic-link library (SSP/AP DLL) containing one or more custom <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security packages</em></a>, you must register it. To do so, add the name of your custom SSP/AP DLL to the data of the following registry value:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>System</strong>\<strong>CurrentControlSet</strong>\<strong>Control</strong>\<strong>Lsa</strong>\<strong>Security Packages</strong></p>
<p>The data for this registry value is a list of the names of SSP/AP DLLs, without the &quot;.dll&quot; extension. The data type for this list is <strong>REG_MULTI_SZ</strong> so there must be a null character ('\0') between each DLL name in the list.</p>
<p>Typically, SSP/AP DLLs are stored in the %systemroot%/system32 directory. If this is the path to your custom SSP/AP DLL then do not include the path as part of the DLL name. If, however, the DLL is in a different path, include the complete path to the DLL in the name.</p>
<p>Each time the system starts, the LSA loads the SSP/AP DLLs in this list and performs the initialization sequence described in <a href="lsa-mode-initialization.html">LSA-Mode Initialization</a>.</p>
<h3>Registering a custom security package as the default TLS SSP</h3>
<p>After developing a custom TLS security support provider and registering it as described above, you must also register it as the â€œdefault TLS SSP.â€ To do so, populate the package name of your custom SSP to the data of the following registry value:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>System</strong>\<strong>CurrentControlSet</strong>\<strong>Control</strong>\<strong>Lsa</strong>\<strong>Default TLS SSP</strong></p>
<p>The data for this registry value is the package name of SSP, not the dll name. The data type for this is <strong>REG_SZ</strong>.</p>
<p>User mode applications which use â€œdefault TLS SSPâ€ will use the default registered here. Kernel mode applications or user mode applications which use â€œMicrosoft Unified Security Protocol Providerâ€ or other specific TLS SSP names will not be impacted by this change.</p>

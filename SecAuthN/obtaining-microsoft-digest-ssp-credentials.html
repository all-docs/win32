<h1>Obtaining Microsoft Digest SSP Credentials</h1>
<p>User <a href="../secgloss/c-gly.html"><em>credentials</em></a> are required by Microsoft Digest; both client and server must present valid credentials before they can establish a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security context</em></a> for message exchange. Credentials handles are used to obtain and present credentials.</p>
<p>Because the credential handle is used to store configuration information, the same handle cannot be used for both client-side and server-side operations. This means that applications that support both client and server connections must obtain a minimum of two credentials handles.</p>
<p>To get a handle to the credentials required by Microsoft Digest, call the <a href="/windows/win32/api/sspi/nf-sspi-acquirecredentialshandlea"><strong>AcquireCredentialsHandle</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>The following C language examples demonstrate obtaining credentials.</p>

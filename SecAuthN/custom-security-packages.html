<h1>Custom Security Packages</h1>
<p>To implement new security protocols that are integrated with the Windows Server and Windows operating systems, use the custom security package API and the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>Local Security Authority</em></a> (LSA) functions.</p>
<p>The custom security package API supports combined development of custom <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security support providers</em></a> (SSPs), which provide <a href="noninteractive-authentication.html">Noninteractive Authentication</a> services and secure message exchange to client/server applications, with the development of custom <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>authentication packages</em></a>, which provide services for applications that perform <a href="interactive-authentication.html">Interactive Authentication</a>. These services, when combined in a single package, are called a security support provider/authentication package (SSP/AP).</p>
<p>As with Microsoft-provided security packages, users of the custom security package access interactive authentication services using the <a href="authentication-functions.html">LSA Logon Functions</a>. Noninteractive authentication and message protection services can be accessed directly using <a href="sspi.html">Security Support Provider Interface</a> (SSPI).</p>
<p>The security packages deployed in SSP/APs are fully integrated with the LSA. Using the LSA support functions available to custom security packages, developers can implement advanced security features such as token creation, <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>supplemental credentials</em></a> support, and pass-through authentication. For a list of these support functions, see <a href="authentication-functions.html">LSA Functions Called by Authentication Packages</a>. For information about how to implement custom security packages, see <a href="creating-custom-security-packages.html">Creating Custom Security Packages</a>.</p>

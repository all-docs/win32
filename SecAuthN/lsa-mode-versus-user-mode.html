<h1>LSA Mode vs. User Mode</h1>
<p>When an SSP/AP <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security package</em></a> is functioning as an <a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication package</em></a>, it is loaded into the process space of the <a href="../secgloss/l-gly.html"><em>Local Security Authority</em></a> (LSA) and is said to be in LSA mode. Logon applications access authentication package functionality using the <a href="authentication-functions.html">LSA Logon Functions</a>. Developers can use LSA support functions available only to LSA-mode security packages to implement more sophisticated authentication packages than previously supported.</p>
<p>When a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security package</em></a> provides security services to a client/server application, it is loaded into the client and server processes and is said to be in user mode. Client/server applications access the security package's security support services using Microsoft <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>Security Support Provider Interface</em></a> (SSPI).</p>
<p>LSA support for SSP/APs includes functions that the LSA-mode and user-mode instances of a security package can use to communicate. Additionally, the user-mode instance of a security package can delegate selected requests for information to the LSA-mode instance of the package.</p>
<p>For details about how security packages are initialized for each mode, see <a href="lsa-mode-initialization.html">LSA-mode Initialization</a> and <a href="user-mode-initialization.html">User-mode Initialization</a>.</p>

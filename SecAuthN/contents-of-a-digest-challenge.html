<h1>Contents of a Digest Challenge</h1>
<p>The size of a Digest Access challenge must be less than 2048 bytes. The following example shows a challenge assigned to the character string szChallenge.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>szChallenge = &quot;realm=\&quot;Microsoft_Example_Forest\&quot;,&quot;;
algorithm = &quot;MD5-sess\&quot;, qop=\&quot;auth\&quot;, nonce=\&quot;0123456789abcdef\&quot;&quot;;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The challenge string is enclosed in double quotes and contains embedded double quotes. Embedded double quotes must be preceded (escaped) with a backslash (\).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>A Digest challenge can contain the following directives.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Directive</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>realm</td>
<td>An implementation-defined hint to the client about which <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly"><em>credentials</em></a> are required. The client should display this information to the user if it is prompting for credentials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>algorithm</td>
<td>Microsoft Digest supports MD5 and MD5-Sess. For optimal performance, use MD5-Sess.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>qop</td>
<td>This directive can be set to auth, auth-int, or auth-conf. For more information, see <a href="quality-of-protection-and-ciphers.html">Quality of Protection and Ciphers</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>nonce</td>
<td>A unique encoded value generated by the server for each challenge. This value must not be altered by the client.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>opaque</td>
<td>Contains a reference for the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security context</em></a> that is being established. For more information, see <a href="maintaining-the-security-context-between-connections.html">Maintaining the Security Context Between Connections</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cipher(SASL only)</td>
<td>The list of ciphers that the server supports. This element can be present in a Digest SASL challenge only if the qop directive specifies auth-conf. For more information, see <a href="quality-of-protection-and-ciphers.html">Quality of Protection and Ciphers</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>charset</td>
<td>This directive can be set to utf-8 if the server can process UTF-8â€“encoded user names and realms. If the client understands the charset directive, it can respond by using UTF-8â€“encoded values.</td>
</tr>

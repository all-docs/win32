<h1>SSP/APs vs. SSPs</h1>
<p><a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>Security packages</em></a> are deployed in one of the following types of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#sspaps-vs-ssps">SSP/APs</a></li>
<li><a href="#sspaps-vs-ssps">SSPs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether a security package is in a security support provider/<a href="../secgloss/a-gly.html"><em>authentication package</em></a> (SSP/AP) or a <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security support provider</em></a> (SSP) DLL is determined by the types of security services it provides and the extent to which it requires integration with the <a href="../secgloss/l-gly.html"><em>Local Security Authority</em></a> (LSA). These differences also determine the API implemented in a custom security package.</p>
<h2>SSP/APs</h2>
<p>An SSP/AP is a DLL that contains one or more <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>Security packages</em></a> and can function as an SSP for client/server applications and as an <a href="authentication-packages.html">authentication package</a> for logon applications. To function in both of these roles, SSP/APs are loaded into the LSA process space at system startup and can be loaded into client/server application processes as well.</p>
<p>Custom SSP/AP security packages must implement both the <a href="authentication-functions.html">Functions Implemented by User-mode SSP/APs</a>, and <a href="authentication-functions.html">Functions Implemented by SSP/APs</a>. These function implementations can make use of LSA support functions to offer advanced security features such as token creation, <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>supplemental credentials</em></a> support, and pass-through authentication.</p>
<p>If a custom SSP/AP security package provides the full range of message <a href="../secgloss/i-gly.html"><em>integrity</em></a> and privacy functions, it will also implement the <a href="authentication-functions.html">Functions Implemented by User-mode SSP/APs</a>.</p>
<h2>SSPs</h2>
<p>An SSP is a DLL that contains one or more security packages that provide authenticated connection, message integrity, and message encryption services to client/server applications. SSPs implement <a href="sspi.html">Security Support Provider Interface</a> (SSPI) functions. Applications can access the security packages in an SSP by calling the SSPI functions directly. SSPs are loaded into the client and server processes; they are not integrated with the LSA.</p>

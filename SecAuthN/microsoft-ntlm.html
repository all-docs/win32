<h1>Microsoft NTLM</h1>
<p>Windows Challenge/Response (NTLM) is the authentication protocol used on networks that include systems running the Windows operating system and on stand-alone systems.</p>
<p>The Microsoft <a href="../secgloss/k-gly.html"><em>Kerberos</em></a> <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security package</em></a> adds greater security than NTLM to systems on a network. Although Microsoft <em>Kerberos</em> is the protocol of choice, NTLM is still supported. NTLM must also be used for logon authentication on stand-alone systems. For more information about Kerberos, see <a href="microsoft-kerberos.html">Microsoft Kerberos</a>.</p>
<p>NTLM credentials are based on data obtained during the interactive logon process and consist of a domain name, a user name, and a one-way <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> of the user's password. NTLM uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol to authenticate a user without sending the user's password over the wire. Instead, the system requesting authentication must perform a calculation that proves it has access to the secured NTLM credentials.</p>
<p>Interactive NTLM authentication over a network typically involves two systems: a client system, where the user is requesting authentication, and a domain controller, where information related to the user's password is kept. Noninteractive authentication, which may be required to permit an already logged-on user to access a resource such as a server application, typically involves three systems: a client, a server, and a domain controller that does the authentication calculations on behalf of the server.</p>
<p>The following steps present an outline of NTLM noninteractive authentication. The first step provides the user's NTLM credentials and occurs only as part of the interactive authentication (logon) process.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(Interactive authentication only) A user accesses a client computer and provides a domain name, user name, and password. The client computes a cryptographic <a href="../secgloss/h-gly.html"><em>hash</em></a> of the password and discards the actual password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client sends the user name to the server (in <a href="../secgloss/p-gly.html"><em>plaintext</em></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server generates a 8-byte random number, called a <em>challenge</em> or <a href="../secgloss/n-gly.html"><em>nonce</em></a>, and sends it to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The client encrypts this challenge with the hash of the user's password and returns the result to the server. This is called the <em>response</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server sends the following three items to the domain controller:</p>
<ul>
<li>User name</li>
<li>Challenge sent to the client</li>
<li>Response received from the client</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The domain controller uses the user name to retrieve the hash of the user's password from the Security Account Manager database. It uses this password hash to encrypt the challenge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The domain controller compares the encrypted challenge it computed (in step 6) to the response computed by the client (in step 4). If they are identical, authentication is successful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your application should not access the NTLM <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security package</em></a> directly; instead, it should use the <a href="../secgloss/n-gly.html"><em>Negotiate</em></a> security package. Negotiate allows your application to take advantage of more advanced <a href="../secgloss/s-gly.html"><em>security protocols</em></a> if they are supported by the systems involved in the authentication. Currently, the Negotiate security package selects between <a href="../secgloss/k-gly.html"><em>Kerberos</em></a> and NTLM. Negotiate selects Kerberos unless it cannot be used by one of the systems involved in the authentication.</p>

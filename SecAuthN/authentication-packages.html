<h1>Authentication Packages</h1>
<p><a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/a-gly"><em>Authentication packages</em></a> are contained in dynamic-link libraries. The <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>Local Security Authority</em></a> (LSA) loads authentication packages by using configuration information stored in the registry. Loading multiple authentication packages permits the LSA to support multiple logon processes and multiple <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security protocols</em></a>.</p>
<p>Logon processes use authentication packages to analyze logon data. New logon processes are added to a system by adding a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/g-gly"><em>GINA</em></a> to collect the required logon data and, if needed, by adding a new authentication package to analyze the data.</p>
<p>Security protocols are implemented by authentication packages. An authentication package analyzes logon data by following the rules and procedures set forth in a security protocol.</p>
<p>Authentication packages are responsible for the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyzing logon data to determine whether a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security principal</em></a> is allowed to log on to a system.</li>
<li>Establishing a new <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>logon session</em></a> and creating a unique <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>logon identifier</em></a> for the successfully authenticated principal.</li>
<li>Passing security information to the LSA for the principal's security token.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user attempts an interactive logon, the LSA calls an authentication package to determine whether to permit the user to log on. MSV1_0, for example, is an authentication package installed with the Microsoft Windows operating system. The MSV1_0 package accepts a user name and a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/h-gly"><em>hashed</em></a> password. It looks up the user name and hashed password combination in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database. If the logon data matches the stored <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly"><em>credentials</em></a>, the authentication package permits the logon to succeed.</p>
<p>After successfully authenticating a <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security principal's</em></a> credentials, an authentication package is responsible for creating a new LSA logon session for the principal and allocating the <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/l-gly"><em>logon identifier</em></a> that uniquely identifies the logon session. The authentication package may associate credential information with the logon session for subsequent authentication requests. For example, the MSV1_0 authentication package (provided by Microsoft) associates the user account name and a hash of the user's password with each logon session.</p>
<p>The authentication package also provides a set of <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>security identifiers</em></a> (SIDs) and other information appropriate for inclusion in the security token created by the LSA. This token will represent the principal's security <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly"><em>context</em></a> for access to Windows operations.</p>
<p>After a logon session is created and associated with a principal, subsequent authentication requests made on behalf of the principal are handled differently than the initial logon. The authentication package does not create a new logon session nor return information for creating a token. The authentication package can, however, associate <a href="/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly"><em>supplemental credentials</em></a> obtained during a subsequent authentication with the principal's existing logon session. Supplemental credentials are obtained when access to a requested resource requires information beyond the credentials established by the initial logon. For example, when a logged-on user requests a Novell network logon, a Novell-specific authentication package can be called and Novell-specific credentials can be authenticated and associated with the logon session. These credentials can be referenced by a Novell redirector (by way of the Novell authentication package) when the user accesses the Novell network.</p>

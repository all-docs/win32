<h1>Recognizing a Request to Renegotiate a Connection</h1>
<p>The <a href="decryptmessage--general.html"><strong>DecryptMessage (General)</strong></a> function traps requests for renegotiation coming from the message sender. It notifies your application by decrypting the message data and returning the SEC_I_RENEGOTIATE value.</p>
<p>Your application must handle such requests by calling <a href="acceptsecuritycontext--general.html"><strong>AcceptSecurityContext (General)</strong></a> (servers) or <a href="initializesecuritycontext--general.html"><strong>InitializeSecurityContext (General)</strong></a> (clients) and passing the contents of SECBUFFER_EXTRA returned from DecryptMessage in the SECBUFFER_TOKEN. After this initial call returns a value, proceed as though your application were creating a new connection.</p>

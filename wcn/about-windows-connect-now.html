<h1>About Windows Connect Now</h1>
<p>Windows Connect Now (WCN) provides a simple and secure mechanism for network access points and devices (like printers, camera, and PCs) to connect and exchange settings. This API is the Microsoft implementation of the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)/Wi-Fi Simple Configuration (WSC) protocol, which was created by the Wi-Fi Alliance as a solution for home networking and small businesses. This technology is not intended for enterprise scenarios.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The specification name changed between version 1.0h and version 2. The version 1.0h specification was named Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). Starting with version 2 specification, the specification is named Wi-Fi Simple Configuration (WSC). In our documentation, the terms WPS and WSC are used interchangeably unless noted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Windows Connect Now enables applications to search for WCN-capable devices using the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fundisc/fd-portal">Function Discovery API</a>. The scope of a search can be narrowed down to a specific SSID, state, category, or even broadened to include all WCN-capable devices. Once devices are located, the WCN API allows communication with the WCN-capable device in order to facilitate configuration or connectivity.</p>

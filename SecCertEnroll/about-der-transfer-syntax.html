<h1>DER Transfer Syntax</h1>
<p>Applying an encoding rule to the data structures described by an abstract syntax provides a transfer syntax that governs how bytes in a stream are organized when sent between computers. The transfer syntax used by Distinguished Encoding Rules always follows a <em>Tag, Length, Value</em> format. The format is usually referred to as a TLV triplet in which each field (T, L, or V) contains one or more bytes.</p>
<p><img src="images/der-tlv-basic.png" alt="der type, length, and value (tlv) triplet" /></p>
<p>The <em>Tag</em> field specifies the type of the data structure being sent, the <em>Length</em> field specifies the number of bytes of content being transferred, and the <em>Value</em> field contains the content. Note that the <em>Value</em> field can be a triplet if it contains a constructed data type as shown by the following illustration.</p>

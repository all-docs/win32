<h1>Mapping Xenroll.dll to CertEnroll.dll</h1>
<p>Prior to WindowsÂ Vista, the Certificate Enrollment Control was implemented in Xenroll.dll. The Xenroll.dll library has been removed from the operating system and replaced by CertEnroll.dll.</p>
<p>Xenroll attempted to implement two parallel sets of interfaces. <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-icenroll"><strong>ICEnroll</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-icenroll2"><strong>ICEnroll2</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-icenroll3"><strong>ICEnroll3</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-icenroll4"><strong>ICEnroll4</strong></a> were Automation-compliant and compatible with scripting languages. The corresponding interfacesâ€”<a href="/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-ienroll"><strong>IEnroll</strong></a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-ienroll2"><strong>IEnroll2</strong></a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/xenroll/nn-xenroll-ienroll4"><strong>IEnroll4</strong></a>â€”could not be scripted but were more convenient for C++ programmers. As they evolved, the two sets of interfaces did not remain synchronized. In particular, the set of dual interfaces represented most recently by <strong>ICEnroll4</strong> defines only a subset of the functionality defined by <strong>IEnroll4</strong>.</p>
<p>CertEnroll.dll implements a larger and more structured set of Automation-compliant COM interfaces. The following topics discuss how Xenroll.dll maps to CertEnroll.dll for different types of functionality.</p>

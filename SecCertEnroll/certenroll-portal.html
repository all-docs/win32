<h1>Certificate Enrollment API</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Certificate Enrollment API can be used to create a client application to request a certificate and install a certificate response. This API is implemented in CertEnroll.dll beginning with Windows Vista; it replaces Xenroll.dll.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>The Certificate Enrollment API is for use by developers of applications that will enable users to create, request, and retrieve certificates over media, such as the Internet or an intranet, that are not inherently secure. Developers should be familiar with the C and C++ programming languages, the Component Object Model (COM), and the Windows-based programming environment. Although not required, an understanding of cryptography and public key infrastructure is advised.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>The Certificate Enrollment API is supported beginning with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.</p>

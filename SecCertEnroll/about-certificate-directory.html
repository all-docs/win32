<h1>Certificate Directory</h1>
<p>A Windows public key infrastructure (PKI) saves certificates on the server that hosts the certification authority (CA) and on the local computer or device. CA storage is typically referred to as the certificate database, and local storage is known as the certificate store.</p>
<h2>Certificate Database</h2>
<p>When you add Certificate Services on a Windows server and configure a CA, a certificate database is created. By default, the database is contained in the <em>%SystemRoot%</em>\System32\Certlog folder, and the name is based on the CA name with an .edb extension. The database can contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issued certificates</li>
<li>Revoked certificates</li>
<li>Archived private keys</li>
<li>Certificate requests</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot use the Certificate Enrollment API to manipulate the database. The enrollment process automatically creates the necessary entries.</p>
<h2>Certificate Stores</h2>
<p>Microsoft Certificate Services copies issued certificates and pending or rejected requests to local computers and devices. The storage location is called the certificate store and consists of the following logical stores.</p>

<h1>Certificate Chain</h1>
<p>A certificate chain is a hierarchal collection of certificates that leads from the end user or computer back to a root of trust, typically the root certification authority (CA) of an organization. Because all parties presumably trust the root certificate, a party can gain trust in an end-entity certificate by verifying the certificate chain. Verification typically requires establishing that each certificate in the chain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is signed by the public key in the prior certificate.</li>
<li>Has not expired.</li>
<li>Has not been revoked.</li>
<li>Conforms to the policies specified by prior certificates.</li>
</ul>

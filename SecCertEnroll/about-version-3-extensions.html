<h1>Version 3 Extensions</h1>
<p>An X.509 version 3 certificate contains the fields defined in version 1 and version 2 and adds certificate extensions. The ASN.1 syntax of certificate extensions is shown in the following example.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Extensions (beginning with version 3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Extensions ::= SEQUENCE OF Extension

Extension ::= SEQUENCE 
{
  Id                  OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
  critical            BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  extnValue           OCTET STRING
}
</code></pre>
<p>The standard version 3 extensions and their object identifiers (OIDs) are listed in the following table. Microsoft supports these and includes additional custom extensions. For more information, see <a href="extensions.html">Extensions</a>.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Authority Key Identifier(2.5.29.35)</td>
<td>Identifies the certification authority (CA) public key that corresponds to the CA private key used to sign the certificate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Basic Constraints(2.5.29.19)</td>
<td>Specifies whether the entity can be used as a CA and, if so, the number of subordinate CAs that can exist beneath it in the certificate chain.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Certificate Policies(2.5.29.32)</td>
<td>Specifies the policies under which the certificate has been issued and the purposes for which it can be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CRL Distribution Points(2.5.29.31)</td>
<td>Contains the URI of the base <a href="/windows/win32/SecGloss/c-gly"><em>certificate revocation list</em></a> (CRL).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enhanced Key Usage(2.5.29.46)</td>
<td>Specifies the manner in which the public key contained in the certificate can be used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Issuer Alternative Name(2.5.29.8)</td>
<td>Specifies one or more alternative name forms for the issuer of the certificate request.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Key Usage(2.5.29.15)</td>
<td>Specifies restrictions on the operations that can be performed by the public key contained in the certificate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name Constraints(2.5.29.30)</td>
<td>Specifies the namespace within which all subject names in a certificate hierarchy must be located. The extension is used only in a CA certificate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Policy Constraints(2.5.29.36)</td>
<td>Constrains path validation by prohibiting policy mapping or by requiring that each certificate in the hierarchy contain an acceptable policy identifier. The extension is used only in a CA certificate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Policy Mappings(2.5.29.33)</td>
<td>Specifies the policies in a subordinate CA that correspond to policies in the issuing CA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Private Key Usage Period(2.5.29.16)</td>
<td>Specifies a different validity period for the private key than for the certificate with which the private key is associated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Subject Alternative Name(2.5.29.17)</td>
<td>Specifies one or more alternative name forms for the subject of the certificate request. Example alternative forms include email addresses, DNS names, IP addresses, and URIs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Subject Directory Attributes(2.5.29.9)</td>
<td>Conveys identification attributes such as the nationality of the certificate subject. The extension value is a sequence of OID-value pairs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Subject Key Identifier(2.5.29.14)</td>
<td>Differentiates between multiple public keys held by the certificate subject. The extension value is typically a SHA-1 hash of the key.</td>
</tr>

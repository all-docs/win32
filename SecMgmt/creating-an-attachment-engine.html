<h1>Creating an Attachment Engine</h1>
<p>An attachment engine is a DLL that processes service-specific configuration and analysis requests. In other words, it handles the processing that cannot be handled by the standard Security Configuration tool set.</p>
<p>To create an attachment engine, you must implement the following three functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="scesvcattachmentanalyze.html"><strong>SceSvcAttachmentAnalyze</strong></a>, which computes the difference between the service's configuration and the configuration stored in the security database. These differences are written to the security database. For more information, see <a href="implementing-scesvcattachmentanalyze.html">Implementing SceSvcAttachmentAnalyze</a>.</li>
<li><a href="scesvcattachmentconfig.html"><strong>SceSvcAttachmentConfig</strong></a>, which configures the service as specified in the snap-in user interface. For more information, see <a href="implementing-scesvcattachmentconfig.html">Implementing SceSvcAttachmentConfig</a>.</li>
<li><a href="scesvcattachmentupdate.html"><strong>SceSvcAttachmentUpdate</strong></a>, which updates the base configuration and configuration analysis for the service in the security database. For more information, see <a href="implementing-scesvcattachmentupdate.html">Implementing SceSvcAttachmentUpdate</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Security Configuration tool set implements a set of support functions that your application can call to query and set information in the security database. For more information, see <a href="management-functions.html">Attachment Callback Functions</a>.</p>
<p>After you create an attachment engine DLL, you must register it with the Security Configuration tool set. This process is described in <a href="registering-an-attachment-engine.html">Registering an Attachment Engine</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to creating an attachment engine, you must also create an attachment snap-in extension. The snap-in extension provides a user interface for service-specific tasks. When the user specifies a new configuration using a snap-in extension, the request is passed to the appropriate attachment engine. The engine then connects to the service and changes its configuration. If you do not implement a snap-in extension, users will have no way to change the service configuration or analysis. For more information on how to create an attachment snap-in extension, see <a href="creating-an-attachment-snap-in-extension.html">Creating an Attachment Snap-in Extension</a>.</p>

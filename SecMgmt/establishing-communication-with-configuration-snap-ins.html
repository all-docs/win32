<h1>Establishing Communication with Configuration Snap-ins</h1>
<p>After your attachment snap-in extension has added itself to the Services node, it should establish communication with the Security Configuration snap-in. This is necessary because the attachment snap-in extension gets its data, as well as any changes made by the user, from the Security Configuration snap-in. This can be done as described in the following procedure.</p>
<p><strong>To establish communication with the Security Configuration snap-ins</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Obtain the configuration file name using the CCF_SCESVC_ATTACHMENT clipboard format, which returns the configuration file name as a <strong>PWSTR</strong>.</p>
<p>If the attachment is inserted under a configuration type node, the attachment needs to know which configuration it is. (It communicates this information to the Security Configuration snap-ins during interface initialization.) In this case, use the following code.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>PWSTR * TemplateName = ExtractTemplateFromDataObject(lpDataObject);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up the context with the Security Configuration snap-ins. After the configuration name is known, or if the service node is an analysis node, the attachment snap-in extension must call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Scesvc/nf-scesvc-iscesvcattachmentdata-initialize"><strong>ISceSvcAttachmentData::Initialize</strong></a> to set up the context, as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>LPSCESVCATTACHMENTPERSISTINFO pSceInfo;

    HRESULT hr = ((LPSCESVCATTACHMENTPERSISTINFO)this)-&gt;
            QueryInterface(IID_ISceSvcAttachmentPersistInfo,
            (void**)&amp;pSceInfo);

    if ( SUCCEEDED(hr) )
    {

        hr = m_pSceData-&gt;Initialize(strServiceName, TemplateName,
                pSceInfo, &amp;ThisHandle);
        // Continue processing (not shown).
    }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
When you have finished using the handle returned by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Scesvc/nf-scesvc-iscesvcattachmentdata-initialize"><strong>ISceSvcAttachmentData::Initialize</strong></a>, close the handle by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Scesvc/nf-scesvc-iscesvcattachmentdata-closehandle"><strong>ISceSvcAttachmentData::CloseHandle</strong></a> function. This is typically done when the user closes the MMC console.</p>

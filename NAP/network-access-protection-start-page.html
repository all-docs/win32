<h1>Network Access Protection</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The Network Access Protection platform is not available starting with Windows 10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Network Access Protection (NAP) is a set of operating system components that provide a platform for protected access to private networks. The NAP platform provides an integrated way of evaluating the system health state of a network client that is attempting to connect to or communicate on a network and restricting the access of the network client until health policy requirements have been met.</p>
<p>NAP is an extensible platform that provides an infrastructure and an API set for adding components that store, report, validate, and correct a computer's system health state. By itself, the NAP platform does not provide components to accumulate and evaluate attributes of a computer's health state. Other components, known as system health agents (SHAs) and system health validators (SHVs), provide network policy validation and network policy compliance.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>NAP is designed to be extensible. It can interoperate with any vendor software that provides SHAs and SHVs or that recognizes its published API set. NAP helps provide a solution for the following common scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the health and status of roaming laptops.</li>
<li>Ensure the health of desktop computers.</li>
<li>Verify the compliance and health of computers in remote offices.</li>
<li>Determine the health of visiting laptops.</li>
<li>Verify the compliance and health of unmanaged home computers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>The NAP API is designed for C/C++ developers. For the NAP enforcement methods, programmers should be familiar with networking protocols and technologies such as Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), virtual private networks (VPNs), the IEEE 802.1X standard for wired and wireless access, and Internet Protocol security (IPsec).</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>The NAP platform requires NAP infrastructure servers running Windows Server 2008 or later and NAP clients running Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3), Windows Vista, or later operating systems. For specific information about which operating systems support a particular programming element, refer to the Requirements sections of the NAP APIs in the NAP Reference documentation.</p>

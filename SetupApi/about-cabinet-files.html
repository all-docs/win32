<h1>About Cabinet Files</h1>
<p>A cabinet is a single file, usually suffixed with .CAB, that stores compressed files in a file library. A compressed file can be spread over several cabinet files. During installation, the setup application decompresses the files stored in a cabinet and copies them to the user's system.</p>
<p>If cabinet files are used, the setup functions use the name of the cabinet as the tag file for the source disk it resides on.</p>

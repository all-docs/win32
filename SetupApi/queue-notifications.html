<h1>Queue Notifications</h1>
<p>After a queue is committed by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupcommitfilequeuea"><strong>SetupCommitFileQueue</strong></a>, it will begin to process the queued operations. At each step, the queue sends a notification to the callback routine specified in the call to <strong>SetupCommitFileQueue</strong>.</p>
<p>Following is the syntax that <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupcommitfilequeuea"><strong>SetupCommitFileQueue</strong></a> uses to send a notification to the callback routine.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>MsgHandler(          //the specified callback routine
    Context,         //context used by the callback routine
    Notification,    //queue notification code
    Param1,          //additional notification information
    Param2               //additional notification information
);
</code></pre>
<p>The values of <em>Param1</em> and <em>Param2</em> contain additional information relevant to the notification being sent to the callback routine. Each notification, its <em>Param1</em> and <em>Param2</em> values, and how the default queue callback routine handles that notification, is described in detail in <a href="file-queue-notifications.html">File Queue Notifications</a>.</p>

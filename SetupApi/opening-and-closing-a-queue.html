<h1>Opening and Closing a Queue</h1>
<p>Before you can queue file operations, you must open a file queue. Calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupopenfilequeue"><strong>SetupOpenFileQueue</strong></a> function returns a handle to a queue file. This handle is used by subsequent queue functions to reference the open queue and add operations to it or scan it.</p>
<p>After all the specified file operations have been queued and committed, you must call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupclosefilequeue"><strong>SetupCloseFileQueue</strong></a> function to release resources allocated during the call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupopenfilequeue"><strong>SetupOpenFileQueue</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Setupapi/nf-setupapi-setupclosefilequeue"><strong>SetupCloseFileQueue</strong></a> function does not commit the file queue. Any operations that are uncommitted when <strong>SetupCloseFileQueue</strong> is called will not be performed.</p>

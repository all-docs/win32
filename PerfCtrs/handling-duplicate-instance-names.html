<h1>Handling Duplicate Instance Names</h1>
<p>Although providers are strongly encouraged to use unique instance names, not all providers do. The convention for displaying duplicate instance names is to append a <code>#</code> character and a serial number to the instance name, except for the first occurrence of the name. For example, if there are three instances of <code>svchost</code> in a sample, the three names are displayed as <code>svchost</code>, <code>svchost#1</code>, and <code>svchost#2</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this convention does not completely resolve the issue. Serial numbers are assigned based on the order in which a particular instance name appears in a sample, and this order may be inconsistent from sample to sample. For example, sample A might see <code>svchost</code> (PID 100), <code>svchost#1</code> (PID 200), and <code>svchost#2</code> (PID 300). Then if the svchost with PID 100 shuts down, the next sample would see <code>svchost</code> (PID 200) and <code>svchost#1</code> (PID 300). Basic matching logic would try to match sample A's <code>svchost#1</code> statistics (from PID 200) against sample B's <code>svchost#1</code> statistics (from PID 300), resulting in invalid results for sample B. Errors occur when a new non-unique instance shows up in a sample or when a non-unique instance stops showing up in a sample (unless the added/removed instance was the last one).</p>
<h2>Process counterset</h2>
<p>This issue is especially problematic for the <code>Process</code> counterset because it uses only the process's EXE name as the instance name even though the EXE name is not unique. The default behavior of the <code>Process</code> counterset on Windows cannot be changed due to compatibility issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP]
Windows 11 and later include the new <code>Process V2</code> counterset. The <code>Process V2</code> counterset includes the process ID (PID) in the instance name which avoids the name duplication issue of the <code>Process</code> counterset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can alter the behavior of the <code>Process</code> and <code>Thread</code> countersets to use unique instance names by setting the <code>ProcessNameFormat</code> or <code>ThreadNameFormat</code> registry values under the <code>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Perfproc\Performance</code> registry key.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!CAUTION]
Enabling unique instance names for the <code>Process</code> counterset may cause some programs to behave incorrectly, since many programs expect the non-unique naming pattern. For example, a program that is looking for an instance with a specific well-known EXE name will no longer be able to find that instance after enabling unique instance names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The registry type for these values is <code>REG_DWORD</code>. Setting the value to <code>2</code> appends the process identifier (PID) to the process instance name and the thread identifier (TID) to the thread instance name. To disable this feature, set the value to 1 or delete the value.</p>

<h1>Deleting Performance Counters</h1>
<p>To remove your application's performance counters from the system, perform the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <strong>unlodctr</strong> tool included with the computer to remove the counter related data from the registry. Note that the application's <strong>Performance</strong> key must exist for the <strong>unlodctr</strong> tool to succeed. For details, see <a href="removing-counter-names-and-descriptions-from-the-registry.html">Removing Counter Names and Descriptions from the Registry</a>.</li>
<li>Delete the <strong>Performance</strong> and <strong>Linkage</strong> keys under the application's <strong>Services</strong> key. To delete these keys, use either the Regedt32.exe utility or call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winreg/nf-winreg-regdeletekeya"><strong>RegDeleteKey</strong></a>.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Providing Counter Data Using a Performance DLL</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
Due to significant performance and reliability limitations, the method for providing performance counter data that this topic describes may be altered or unavailable in the future. Instead, Microsoft recommends that you use the method described in <a href="providing-counter-data-using-version-2-0.html">Providing Counter Data Using Version 2.0</a> for creating new performance counters, and that you migrate existing performance counters to use that method as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A service, driver, or application that wants to provide counter data can write a performance DLL to provide the data. When a consumer queries performance data, the system loads the provider DLL into the consumer's process and calls the provider to collect the data. For details on writing the performance DLL, see <a href="creating-a-performance-extension-dll.html">Creating a Performance Extension DLL</a>.</p>
<p>The system uses the registry to determine which provider to call. For information on registering your provider and the counters that it supports, see <a href="adding-performance-counters.html">Adding Performance Counters</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]
Performance DLLs are not supported on Windows OneCore. If writing a component that must run on Windows OneCore, use the method described in <a href="providing-counter-data-using-version-2-0.html">Providing Counter Data Using Version 2.0</a>.</p>

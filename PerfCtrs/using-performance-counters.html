<h1>Using Performance Counters</h1>
<p>Performance counter <strong>consumers</strong> are software components that collect and make use of performance counter data. Example consumers provided by Microsoft include Performance Monitor (perfmon.exe), Resource Monitor (resmon.exe), Log Manager (logman.exe) and typeperf.exe. Third-party software components may also collect performance data via performance collection APIs or via WMI performance counter classes.</p>
<p>Performance counter <strong>providers</strong> are software components that publish performance counter data. Performance counters can be provided by operating system components, device drivers, and services. Many performance counters are provided as part of the Windows operating system. Additional counters may be provided by third-party software components via the performance counter provider APIs.</p>

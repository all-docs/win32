<h1>Determining Whether a Counter Is Located on a Computer</h1>
<p>To determine if a counter is installed on a particular computer, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Pdh/nf-pdh-pdhvalidatepatha"><strong>PdhValidatePath</strong></a> with the fully qualified counter path. The function returns ERROR_SUCCESS if the counter is located on the specified computer.</p>
<p><a href="/windows/desktop/api/Pdh/nf-pdh-pdhvalidatepatha"><strong>PdhValidatePath</strong></a> validates the entire path; therefore, if any object, instance, or counter in the path does not exist, the return value indicates so. <strong>PdhValidatePath</strong> verifies the specified counter path in this order: computer, performance object, instance, and counter.</p>

<h1>Device Management</h1>
<p>Device management provides a way to uniformly notify all applications and system features of changes that may affect their operation or access to resources. Applications and the system use and process device events to take advantage of new resources when they become available and to prevent loss of data when existing resources become unavailable.</p>

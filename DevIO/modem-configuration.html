<h1>Modem Configuration</h1>
<p>Modem configuration functions enable you to configure a modem before making a connection. An application can set modem options and determine the features of a modem without using commands specific to any modem device. Following are the general features an application may set before making a call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary mode of operation (synchronous, asynchronous, and whether error control is enabled).</li>
<li>V.42 error control (defined by CCITT recommendation V.42), including specific parameters. CCITT stands for the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee.</li>
<li>V.42bis (defined by CCITT recommendation V.42bis) and MNP5 data compression.</li>
<li>Time-out options, including call setup, inactivity, and buffered data delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before setting a modem's configuration, an application should determine the capabilities of the modem device by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-getcommproperties"><strong>GetCommProperties</strong></a> function. This function fills in a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/ns-winbase-commprop"><strong>COMMPROP</strong></a> structure. This structure contains both a general portion, which applies to all communications devices, and a portion that is specific to each provider subtype. For modem devices, the provider-specific portion of the <strong>COMMPROP</strong> structure is a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mcx/ns-mcx-modemdevcaps"><strong>MODEMDEVCAPS</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>An application can get and set the current configuration of a modem by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-getcommconfig"><strong>GetCommConfig</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-setcommconfig"><strong>SetCommConfig</strong></a> functions, both of which use a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/ns-winbase-commconfig"><strong>COMMCONFIG</strong></a> structure. This structure contains both a general portion, which applies to all communications devices, and a portion that is specific to each provider subtype. For modem devices, the provider-specific portion of the <strong>COMMCONFIG</strong> structure is a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mcx/ns-mcx-modemsettings"><strong>MODEMSETTINGS</strong></a> structure.</p>
<p>After configuring a modem, an application can use the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI) to actually establish a connection.</p>
<p>The modem configuration functions do not provide for long-term management and maintenance of a modem. Modem service providers should supply modem configuration dialog boxes for this purpose.</p>

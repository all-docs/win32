<h1>Communications Errors</h1>
<p>There are other circumstances where a read or write operation can be completed with fewer than the requested number of characters, even though a time-out has not occurred. Following are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some drivers support the use of special characters, which complete a read operation immediately with only the characters that have been read up to the point when they are received.</li>
<li>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-purgecomm"><strong>PurgeComm</strong></a> function can be called to prematurely terminate pending read or write operations. This function can also delete the contents of the output or input buffers, or both.</li>
<li>If a communications error occurs during a read or write operation, all I/O operations on the communications resource are terminated. Break conditions, parity errors, or framing errors are examples of such errors. When an error occurs, the process must call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winbase/nf-winbase-clearcommerror"><strong>ClearCommError</strong></a> function to clear the error flag before it can begin additional I/O operations. <strong>ClearCommError</strong> reports the specific error that occurred and the current status of the device.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Overlapped Operations</h1>
<p>Overlapped operations enable a thread to perform a time-consuming I/O operation in the background, leaving the thread free to perform other tasks. To enable overlapped I/O operations on a communications resource, the thread must specify the <strong>FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED</strong> flag in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea"><strong>CreateFile</strong></a> function when the handle is opened. To run the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile"><strong>ReadFile</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefile"><strong>WriteFile</strong></a> function as an overlapped operation, the calling thread must specify a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped"><strong>OVERLAPPED</strong></a> structure. The <strong>OVERLAPPED</strong> structure must contain a handle to a manual-reset (not an auto-reset) event object. The system sets the state of the event object to not-signaled when a call to the I/O function returns before the operation has been completed. The system sets the state of the event object to signaled when the operation has been completed. The thread uses a wait function to check the current state of the event object or to wait for its state to be signaled.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfileex"><strong>ReadFileEx</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-writefileex"><strong>WriteFileEx</strong></a> functions can be performed only as overlapped operations. The calling thread specifies a pointer to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/minwinbase/nc-minwinbase-lpoverlapped_completion_routine"><strong>FileIOCompletionRoutine</strong></a> function, which is performed when the overlapped operation is completed. The completion routine is executed only if the calling thread performs an alertable operation.</p>
<p>For more information about event objects, wait functions, alertable waits, and completion routines, see <a href="/windows/desktop/Sync/about-synchronization">About Synchronization</a>.</p>

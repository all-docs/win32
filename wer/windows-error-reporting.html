<h1>Windows Error Reporting</h1>
<p>The error reporting feature enables users to notify Microsoft of application faults, kernel faults, unresponsive applications, and other application specific problems. Microsoft can use the error reporting feature to provide customers with troubleshooting information, solutions, or updates for their specific problems. Developers can use this infrastructure to receive information that can be used to improve their applications.</p>
<p>Users can enable error reporting through the Windows user interface. They can choose to report errors for specific applications. Administrators can override these settings using Group Policy.</p>
<p>Developers can register with <a href="../appxpkg/windows-desktop-application-program.html">Windows Desktop Application Program</a> to get information about the problems customers are experiencing with their applications and help customers fix these problems. Developers can also use <a href="/windows/desktop/Recovery/application-recovery-and-restart-portal">Application Recovery and Restart</a> to ensure that customers do not lose data when their application crashes and allow users to quickly return to their tasks.</p>

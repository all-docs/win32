<td><a href="text-formatting-and-layout.html">Text Formatting and Layout</a></td>
<td><a href="direct-write-portal.html">DirectWrite</a> provides two interfaces for formatting text: <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextformat"><strong>IDWriteTextFormat</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextlayout"><strong>IDWriteTextLayout</strong></a>. <strong>IDWriteTextFormat</strong> describes only the format for text and is used in cases when an entire string is to be the same font size, style, weight and so on. On the other hand, <strong>IDWriteTextLayout</strong> encapsulates both a text string and the formatting for specified ranges of the string. This document describes each interface and their uses. For more information about the creation and methods of these interfaces, see the <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextformat"><strong>IDWriteTextFormat</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritetextlayout"><strong>IDWriteTextLayout</strong></a> reference pages.</td>

This is the font collection that is most frequently used. However some applications have to use fonts that are not installed on the system, such as from included font files or font files embedded in the application.  If the fonts that you want are not in the system font collection, you can create a custom font collection derived from <a href="/windows/win32/api/dwrite/nn-dwrite-idwritefontcollection"><strong>IDWriteFontCollection</strong></a>.</td>

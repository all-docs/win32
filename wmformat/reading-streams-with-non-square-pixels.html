<h1>Reading Streams with Non-Square Pixels</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Reader applications that need to correctly handle non-square pixels should examine both the stream-level attributes in the ASF header and the data unit extensions on each sample. There are two cases when the output rectangle must be adjusted to compensate for non-square pixels.</p>
<p>When the source content has been captured from a device such as a DV (digital video) camera with non-square pixels in its CCD, a reader application must adjust its video output rectangle so that the image displays correctly on a computer monitor with square pixels.</p>
<p>When your reader application outputs video that will be played back on an NTSC television, for example through an S-Video out connection on the video card, you must adjust the video rectangle so that the image displays correctly on the television's non-square pixels.</p>

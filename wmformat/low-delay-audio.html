<h1>Low-Delay Audio</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Low-delay audio is an encoding mode that produces compressed audio with a smaller buffer-window setting than other modes. This is useful for streams that need to be switched quickly during playback. The typical scenario for this feature is a streamed presentation that includes the ability to arbitrarily switch content, like changing the channel of a television.</p>
<p>When you use a low-delay audio format, the latency for switching content is drastically reduced compared to other audio formats. Latency is also reduced for live broadcasts when you use low-delay formats.</p>
<p>This feature is supported by the Windows Media Audio 9.1 and Windows Media Audio 9.1 Professional codecs. Low-delay formats are available only for constant bit rate encoding (both one-pass and two-pass).</p>

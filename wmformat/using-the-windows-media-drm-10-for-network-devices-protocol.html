<h1>Using the Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices Protocol</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The Windows Media Format SDK provides some features to support the secure network device protocol, Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices. This protocol defines the messages sent between a digital media playback device, such as a set-top video player, and the computer that serves data to the device. The media data sent between server and device is encrypted to protect it from interception.</p>
<p>The communication between your application and devices that support Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices can use whatever networking protocols you prefer. The Windows Media Format SDK does not provide any objects that perform the network communications for you. Instead, the objects of this SDK process some Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices messages after your application has received them.</p>
<p>The features that support Windows Media DRM 10 for Network Devices are device registration, proximity detection, and converting DRM-protected files. These features are described in the following sections.</p>

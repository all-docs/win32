<h1>To Get Reader Performance Statistics</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>When reading files locally with the asynchronous reader, it is not necessary to check the performance of reading operations. If your application is reading from a streaming source however, performance statistics can be very important. Your application can respond to changes in playback performance to ensure the best possible end-user experience.</p>
<p>The performance information you can retrieve from the reader includes the following statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current bandwidth of the connection.</li>
<li>The number of packets received from the server.</li>
<li>The number of lost packets that were recovered.</li>
<li>The number of lost packets that were not recovered.</li>
<li>The percentage of the total number of packets sent that have been received.</li>
</ul>
<p>To get reader performance statistics, perform the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before starting playback, create a <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wm_reader_statistics"><strong>WM_READER_STATISTICS</strong></a> structure. You must set the <strong>cbSize</strong> member to sizeof(WM_READER_STATISTICS).</li>
<li>Obtain a pointer to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/wmsdkidl/nn-wmsdkidl-iwmreaderadvanced"><strong>IWMReaderAdvanced</strong></a> interface of the reader object by calling <strong>IWMReader::QueryInterface</strong>.</li>
<li>During playback, make calls to <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmreaderadvanced-getstatistics"><strong>IWMReaderAdvanced::GetStatistics</strong></a> frequently to monitor performance. Pass your <strong>WM_READER_STATISTICS</strong> structure with each call and examine the appropriate members.</li>
</ol>

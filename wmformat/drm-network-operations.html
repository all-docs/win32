<h1>DRM Network Operations</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Several DRM-related operations require your application to connect to a service running on a network. These operations include individualization, license acquisition, license revocation, and license backup and restoration.</p>
<p>As with any network transaction, your application should account for a variety of difficulties when including features that require network operations. Your application should track the status of the operation to whatever extent is possible for the specific feature, usually by handling status messages. You should provide feedback to the user about status. If an operation fails on the first try, you should give the user the opportunity to retry. In many cases, the first attempt encounters difficulty, but a subsequent try completes without error.</p>

<h1>DRM Individualization</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>Owners of protected content may require users to upgrade some of the digital rights management (DRM) components included in the Windows Media Format SDK before accessing their content. If a user accepts the upgrade, an individualized version of a security file (one unique to their computer) will be downloaded from a Microsoft Web site. If the user declines the upgrade, they will not be able to access the content; however, they will still be able to access unprotected content and protected content that does not require the upgrade. Performing a security upgrade helps increase the level of protection offered by DRM.</p>
<p>Individualization can be done either at setup time or when an application first encounters a protected ASF file that requires it. Because this process modifies a user's system components, the application must notify the user and obtain their informed consent before performing the upgrade. Microsoft Windows Media Player, for example, shows a dialog box with the following text:</p>
<p><strong>Security Upgrade Required</strong></p>
<p><strong>The owner of the protected content you are trying to access requires you to first upgrade some of the Microsoft digital rights management (DRM) components on your computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Click OK to upgrade your DRM components.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you click OK, a unique identifier and a DRM security file are sent to a Microsoft service on the Internet. The file is replaced with a customized version that contains your unique identifier. This increases the level of protection provided by DRM.</strong></p>
<p>Any application that supports individualization should use the same or similar wording. For more information on Microsoft's Privacy Policy, see the <a href="privacy-statement.html">Privacy Statement</a> section of this documentation.</p>

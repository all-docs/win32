<h1>License Pre-Delivery</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>License pre-delivery is the process used to pull licenses to a client computer preemptively. A common scenario for using pre-delivery is when a user subscribes to a music service. Without delivering licenses before they are needed, the user would have to wait for license acquisition for each new song.</p>
<p>Because pre-delivery is not done as a response to attempted access, it is typically performed only by the content owner. That is, you can only pre-deliver licenses for content that you control. The pre-delivery process is a coordination between a client component and a license server built by using the objects of the Windows Media Digital Rights Management SDK.</p>
<p>License pre-delivery is similar to <a href="non-silent-license-acquisition.html">Non-Silent License Acquisition</a>. Follow the same steps, except that you don't have a DRM header to pass to <a href="iwmdrmlicensemanagement-acquirelicense.html"><strong>IWMDRMLicenseManagement::AcquireLicense</strong></a>. The method will generate a challenge that is not content-specific that you can send to your license server.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use the <a href="/previous-versions//bb676133(v=technet.10)">Windows Media Rights Manager</a> to pre-deliver licenses.</p>

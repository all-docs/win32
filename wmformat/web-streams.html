<h1>Web Streams</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>A Web stream is like a file stream in that it contains data files. In a Web stream, these files are typically HTML pages and associated graphics in GIF or JPEG format.</p>
<p>Web streams can be particularly useful for ASF files that are used as presentations. Prior to the support of Web streams, presentations would have URLs in script streams within a file so that a Web page would load at a predetermined time. The difficulty was that network congestion could cause delays and create a poor viewing experience.</p>
<p>With Web streams, the constituent parts of Web pages can be included in the ASF file as a stream. As the files are received, they can be cached so that, when the command to display (or render) a URL is delivered, they can be instantly accessed by a browser. This enables smooth, consistent playback. The render command is delivered in the Web stream itself, not as a script command in a separate stream.</p>
<p>It is recommended that Web streams created by using the Windows Media Format 9 Series SDK, or later be given the version number 1. This value is specified in the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/ns-wmsdkidl-wmt_webstream_format"><strong>WMT_WEBSTREAM_FORMAT</strong></a> structure in the <strong>wVersion</strong> member. The SDK itself does nothing to enforce this version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
When connecting to live broadcast streams that have Web streams, it is possible that the user may receive a render command before the specified file is actually in the local cache. Unless your application handles this condition, the browser will display a &quot;Page not found&quot; error.</p>

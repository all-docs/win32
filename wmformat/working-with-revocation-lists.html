<h1>Working with Revocation Lists</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>To respond to security breaches and to ensure that player applications known to be broken or compromised cannot play or use protected files, each license that is issued contains a revocation list. A revocation list contains the application certificates of all those player applications known to be broken or corrupted. When a new license is received, the DRM component of the player application checks for a revocation list. If one is found that is newer than the one currently on the computer, the newer list is stored. The next time the consumer plays a protected ASF file, the DRM component compares the player application to the revocation list. If the player application is revoked, the DRM component sends an error message to the application.</p>
<p>Player applications can receive a revocation error message in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>The error message is received after the application calls the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmdrmreader-acquirelicense"><strong>IWMDRMReader::AcquireLicense</strong></a> method for a protected file. The call fails with the <strong>HRESULT</strong> code NS_E_DRM_APPCERT_REVOKED, which is supplied to the <strong>OnStatus</strong> callback function with WMT_ACQUIRE_LICENSE status. If this <strong>HRESULT</strong> code is ignored, errors will continue to occur.</li>
<li>The error message is received when the application creates the DRM-enabled reader and calls the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmreader-open"><strong>IWMReader::Open</strong></a> method for a protected file. The call fails with the <strong>HRESULT</strong> code NS_E_DRM_APPCERT_REVOKED, which is supplied to the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/Wmsdkidl/nf-wmsdkidl-iwmstatuscallback-onstatus"><strong>IWMStatusCallback::OnStatus</strong></a> callback method with WMT_OPENED status. When a player application receives this error message, the application should notify end users and provide a way for them to restore functionality to their player. For example, the application can open a URL where end users can download an upgrade for the compromised application.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> DRM is not supported by the x64-based version of this SDK.</p>

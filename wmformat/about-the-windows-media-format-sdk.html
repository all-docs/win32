<h1>About the Windows Media Format SDK</h1>
<p>[The feature associated with this page, <a href="/windows/win32/wmformat/windows-media-format-11-sdk">Windows Media Format 11 SDK</a>, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/source-reader">Source Reader</a> and <a href="/windows/win32/medfound/sink-writer">Sink Writer</a>. <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use <strong>Source Reader</strong> and <strong>Sink Writer</strong> instead of <strong>Windows Media Format 11 SDK</strong>, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]</p>
<p>The MicrosoftÂ® Windows MediaÂ® Format Software Development Kit (SDK) enables developers to create applications that manipulate digital media stored in files conforming to the Advanced Systems Format (ASF) file structure. The ASF structure is a versatile container format for arbitrary <a href="wmformat-glossary.html"><em>streaming</em></a> media. For more information about the structure of ASF files, see <a href="overview-of-the-asf-format.html">Overview of the ASF Format</a>.</p>
<p>This SDK also provides support for encoding and decoding audio and video content using the Windows Media codecs. Each codec (compressor/decompressor) is optimized to get the best quality for a specific type of content. For more information about the supported codecs, see <a href="codec-features.html">Codec Features</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to general file format support and codec integration, the Windows Media Format SDK provides objects for editing descriptive information about digital media. File reading and metadata support is also included for MP3 files, enabling you to create more flexible applications.</p>

<h1>Sample Desktop Application</h1>
<p>The Windows Media Device Manager ships with a sample desktop application called wmdmapp. This application has a graphical user interface that allows you to browse connected devices, create playlists on the device, and drag media files to the device.</p>
<p>This sample application consists of two pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>wmdapp.exe, an executable that displays a window and performs most of the user interface and basic functionality of the program, and</li>
<li>proghelp.dll, a helper DLL that performs utility functions for the application. You must register this DLL after building the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>To compile the sample application, you can use Visual Studio. The following section describes how this is done:</p>

</ul>
<p>After compiling the project, register the proghelp.dll file. To register this DLL, open a command prompt and browse to the directory containing this DLL and type <code>regsvr32 proghelp.dll</code>.</p>

<h1>Tools for Development</h1>
<p>This section describes the various certificates and keys, libraries, and SDKs you will need to program using the Windows Media Device Manager SDK.</p>
<p>Certificates and Keys</p>
<p>The Windows Media Device Manager SDK ships with a test key/certificate pair (in the key.c file) that can be used by an application or a service provider to use Windows Media Device Manager methods on unprotected content. This key/certificate pair allows the application or service provider to use most of the Windows Media Device Manager functionality.</p>
<p>However, to develop an application or service provider that can handle DRM-protected content, you must request one or more certificates (each with a key) from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default">Windows Media Licensing Page</a>. Certificates are required for the following applications or objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service Providers that handle DRM-protected content require a Windows Media Device Manager Service Provider Certificate (and key)</li>
<li>Applications that transfer DRM-protected content require a Windows Media Device Manager Transfer Certificate (and key)</li>
<li>Applications that play DRM-protected content require a DRM Certificate (and key).</li>
<li>License metering components require a metering certificate. This is provided by a license metering service built on the Windows Media Rights Manager SDK, which can be requested on the Windows Media Licensing Page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Libraries and Headers</p>
<p>In addition to the libraries and headers mentioned in <a href="required-library-and-header-files-for-an-application.html">Required Library and Header Files for an Application</a> or <a href="required-libraries-and-headers-for-a-service-provider.html">Required Libraries and Headers for a Service Provider</a>, any application or plug-in that formerly linked to WMDRMSDK.lib to call Windows Media Format SDK functions should now instead link to WMDRMSDKStub.Lib. This library file is used to access DRM-protected files. You can request this library from the Windows Media Licensing Page as well.</p>
<p>Related SDKs</p>
<p>The following Microsoft SDKs provide elements you may need in designing solutions for portable media devices.</p>

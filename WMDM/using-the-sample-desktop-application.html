<h1>Using the Sample Desktop Application</h1>
<p>The sample desktop application is a basic two-paned window somewhat like Windows Explorer. It allows you to browse the contents of a device, using a tree view display of folders in the left pane, and files in the right pane. The root of each folder tree is logically considered a different device, although some devices might represent themselves as several objects (one for each root storage). To read the basic properties of either a folder or a file, right-click the object and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>You can delete files on the device by selecting a file in the right pane and selecting <strong>Delete</strong> on the <strong>File</strong> menu. To add media files to the device, you can drag files from the desktop onto the right pane of the program. Note that files must be of a media format supported by the device; files of unacceptable formats (non-media files such as .txt files, or media formats not supported by the device) will not be sent to the device. (Note that this restriction is the program's; Windows Media Device Manager enables you to send any file to a device if the device will accept it.)</p>
<p>To capture callback events sent to the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/mswmdm/nn-mswmdm-iwmdmoperation"><strong>IWMDMOperation</strong></a> interface, you must check the &quot;Use Operation Interface&quot; option in the <strong>Options</strong> menu.</p>
<p>The <strong>Options</strong> menu also enables you to choose whether to use several more advanced interfaces with features supported by advanced devices.</p>
<p>The <strong>Containers</strong> menu has options to allow you to create a playlist or an album. To create a playlist, select one or more songs on the device and click <strong>Create Playlist</strong> on the <strong>Containers</strong> menu. This feature only works on MTP devices, because the code only supports the creation of an &quot;virtual&quot; playlist file. (A virtual playlist is a playlist that is specified only by metadata values, rather than by a physical file, for example a WPL file.) The device must support empty playlists to use this feature.</p>
<p>To create an album (a playlist with an associated image), select one or more songs on the device and click <strong>Create Album</strong> on the <strong>Containers</strong> menu. A dialog box allows you to browse to a picture file on your computer to associate with the album. Similarly to the way it creates playlists, the application creates an &quot;empty&quot; album file; if the device does not support empty albums, this feature will not work.</p>

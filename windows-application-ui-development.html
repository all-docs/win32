<td><a href="./dlgbox/dialog-boxes.html">Dialog Boxes</a></td>
<td>A dialog box is a temporary window an application creates to retrieve user input. An application typically uses dialog boxes to prompt the user for additional information for menu items.

<td><a href="./menurc/resources.html">Menus and Other Resources</a></td>
<td>A resource is binary data that you can add to the executable file of a Windows-based application. A resource can be either standard or defined. The data in a standard resource describes an icon, cursor, menu, dialog box, bitmap, enhanced metafile, font, accelerator table, message-table entry, string-table entry, or version information. An application-defined resource, also called a custom resource, contains any data required by a specific application.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="./hidpi/high-dpi-desktop-application-development-on-windows.html">High DPI</a></td>
<td>Writing a DPI-aware application is the key to making a UI look consistently good across a wide variety of high-DPI display settings. An application that is not DPI-aware but is running on a high-DPI display setting can suffer from many visual artifacts, including incorrect scaling of UI elements, clipped text, and blurry images. By adding support in your application for DPI awareness, you guarantee that the presentation of your application's UI is more predictable, making it more visually appealing to users.</td>

<td>The Windows Animation Manager (Windows Animation) enables rich animation of user interface elements. It is designed to simplify the process of adding animation to an application's user interface and to enable developers to implement animations that are smooth, natural, and interactive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="./controls/window-controls.html">Windows Controls</a></td>
<td>A control is a child window that an application uses in conjunction with another window to enable user interaction. Controls provide the user a way to view and edit text, choose options, choose commands, initiate actions, and view status.</td>

<tr>
<td><a href="./windowsribbon/-uiplat-windowsribbon-entry.html">Windows Ribbon Framework</a></td>

The Ribbon framework is composed of a ribbon command bar that exposes the major features of an application through a series of tabs at the top of an application window, and a context menu system.</td>

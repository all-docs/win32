<h1>About BITS</h1>
<p>Use Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download files from or upload files to HTTP web servers or SMB file servers.</p>
<p>BITS continues to transfer files after an application exits as long as the user who initiated the transfer remains logged on and a network connection is maintained. BITS will not force a network connection. BITS resumes transfers after a network connection that had been lost is reestablished or after a user who had logged off logs back in. For more information, see <a href="users-and-network-connections.html">Users and Network Connections</a>.</p>
<p>BITS is mindful of the current network cost and congestion so that a background job interferes as little as possible with the user's foreground experience. BITS uses idle <a href="network-bandwidth.html">network bandwidth</a> to transfer the files and will increase or decrease the rate at which files are transferred based on the amount of idle network bandwidth available. If a network application begins to consume more bandwidth, BITS decreases its transfer rate to preserve the user's interactive experience. BITS uses app-specified <a href="how-to-block-a-bits-job-from-downloading-over-an-expensive-connection.html">transfer policies</a> to prevent files from transferring on costed network connections.</p>
<p>BITS is also mindful of power usage. Starting with the Windows 10 May 2019 Update, BITS will transfer files when the machine is in <a href="/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/modern-standby">Modern Standby</a> mode and the machine is plugged in.</p>
<p>The BITS application can use the different BITS <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Bits/ne-bits-bg_job_priority">priority levels</a> to let BITS intelligently pick which transfer jobs to run. Higher priority jobs preempt lower priority jobs. Jobs at the same priority level share transfer time, which prevents a large job from blocking small jobs in the transfer queue. Lower priority jobs do not receive transfer time until all higher priority jobs are complete or in an error state.</p>
<p>BITS uses Windows BranchCache for peer caching. For more information, see the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-7/dd755969(v=ws.10)">BranchCache Overview</a>.</p>
<p>Universal Windows Platform (UWP) developers should use the <a href="/uwp/api/Windows.Networking.BackgroundTransfer">Windows.Networking.BackgroundTransfer</a> API and not the BITS API.</p>
<p>There are three types of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Bits/ne-bits-bg_job_type"><strong>transfer jobs</strong></a>. A download job downloads files to the client, an upload job uploads a file to the server, and an upload-reply job uploads a file to the server and receives a reply file from the server application.</p>

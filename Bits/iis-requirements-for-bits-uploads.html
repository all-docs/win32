<h1>IIS Requirements for BITS Uploads</h1>
<p>For uploads, BITS requires IIS 6.0 on Windows ServerÂ 2003, and IIS 7.0 on Windows ServerÂ 2008; BITS does not support IIS 5.1 on WindowsÂ XP. The IIS virtual directory must be enabled for uploads and have the BITS IIS extensions configured.</p>
<p><strong>Core installations of Windows Server:</strong> BITS IIS extensions are not supported.</p>
<p>On Windows ServerÂ 2008, use the <strong>Server Manager</strong> to install the BITS Server Extensions feature. From <strong>Server Manager</strong>, click <strong>Features</strong> in the left pane. In the <strong>Add Features Wizard</strong>, check BITS Server Extensions. Note that the IIS 6 Management Compatibility roles must be installed.</p>
<p>On Windows ServerÂ 2003, use the <strong>Windows Components Wizard</strong> to install the BITS server extension. From <strong>Control Panel</strong>, select <strong>Add or Remove Programs</strong>. Then, select <strong>Add/Remove Windows Components</strong> to display the <strong>Windows Components Wizard</strong>. The BITS server extension is a subcomponent of Internet Information Services (IIS) which is a sub-component of Web Application Server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If the IISAdmin service is restarted, the IIS worker process must be recycled before the BITS service can resume uploads. The IIS worker process can be manually recycled by using the <strong>IISReset.exe</strong> command line utility.</p>

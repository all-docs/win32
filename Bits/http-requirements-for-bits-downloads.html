<h1>HTTP Requirements for BITS Downloads</h1>
<p>BITS supports HTTP and HTTPS downloads and uploads and requires that the server supports the HTTP/1.1 protocol. For downloads, the HTTP server's <strong>Head</strong> method must return the file size and its <strong>Get</strong> method must support the Content-Range and Content-Length headers. As a result, BITS only transfers static file content and generates an error if you try to transfer dynamic content, unless the ASP, ISAPI, or CGI script supports the Content-Range and Content-Length headers.</p>
<p>BITS can use an HTTP/1.0 server as long as it meets the <strong>Head</strong> and <strong>Get</strong> method requirements.</p>
<p>To support downloading ranges of a file, the server must support the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow MIME headers to include the standard Content-Range and Content-Type headers, plus a maximum of 180 bytes of other headers.</li>
<li>Allow a maximum of two CR/LFs between the HTTP headers and the first boundary string.</li>
</ul>

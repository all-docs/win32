<h1>BITS Request Packets</h1>
<p>Request packets describe client requests. There can be only one outstanding request at any given time; you must receive an <a href="bits-response-packets.html">Ack</a> for the current request from the server before sending another request.</p>
<p>The following table lists the request packets sent to the BITS server for upload and upload-reply jobs. The table lists the packets in the typical sequence they are sent to the server.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Request packet</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="ping.html">Ping</a></td>
<td>Establishes a connection and negotiates security with the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="create-session.html">Create-Session</a></td>
<td>Requests an upload session with the BITS server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="fragment.html">Fragment</a></td>
<td>Sends a fragment of the file to the BITS server. The number of fragment requests sent depends on the fragment size you choose and the size of the upload file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="close-session.html">Close-Session</a></td>
<td>Ends the file upload session with the BITS server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="cancel-session.html">Cancel-Session</a></td>
<td>Ends the file upload session with the BITS server. Typically, you send the Cancel-Session packet if the user canceled the job.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The Ping packet is optional. Instead of sending a Ping packet, you can use the Create-Session packet to establish a connection and negotiate security. However, it is more efficient to use the Ping packet for this purpose.</p>

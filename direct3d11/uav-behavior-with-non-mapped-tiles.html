<h1>UAV behavior with non-mapped tiles</h1>
<p>Behavior of unordered access view (UAV) reads and writes depends on the level of hardware support. For a breakdown of requirements, see overall read and write behavior for <a href="tiled-resources-features-tiers.html">Tiled resources features tiers</a>. This section summarizes the ideal behavior.</p>
<p>Shader operations that read from a non-mapped tile in a UAV return 0 in all non-missing components of the format, and the default for missing components.</p>
<p>Shader operations that attempt to write to a non-mapped tile cause nothing to be written to the non-mapped area (while writes to a mapped area proceed). This ideal definition for write handling is not required by <a href="tier-2.html">Tier 2</a>; writes to non-mapped tiles can end up in a cache that subsequent reads could pick up.</p>

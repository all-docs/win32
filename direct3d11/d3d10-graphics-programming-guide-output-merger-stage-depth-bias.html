<h1>Depth Bias</h1>
<p>Polygons that are coplanar in 3D space can be made to appear as if they are not coplanar by adding a z-bias (or depth bias) to each one.</p>
<p>This is a technique commonly used to ensure that shadows in a scene are displayed properly. For instance, a shadow on a wall will likely have the same depth value as the wall. If an application renders a wall first and then a shadow, the shadow might not be visible, or depth artifacts might be visible.</p>
<p>An application can help ensure that coplanar polygons are rendered properly by adding the bias (from the <strong>DepthBias</strong> member of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11_1/ns-d3d11_1-cd3d11_rasterizer_desc1"><strong>D3D11_RASTERIZER_DESC1</strong></a>) to the z-values that the system uses when rendering the sets of coplanar polygons. Polygons with a larger z value will be drawn in front of polygons with a smaller z value.</p>
<p>There are two options for calculating depth bias.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the depth buffer currently bound to the output-merger stage has a <strong>UNORM</strong> format or no depth buffer is bound, the bias value is calculated like this:</p>
<pre><code>Bias = (float)DepthBias * r + SlopeScaledDepthBias * MaxDepthSlope;
</code></pre>
<p>where <em>r</em> is the minimum representable value &gt; 0 in the depth-buffer format converted to <strong>float32</strong>. The <strong>DepthBias</strong> and <strong>SlopeScaledDepthBias</strong> values are <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11_1/ns-d3d11_1-cd3d11_rasterizer_desc1"><strong>D3D11_RASTERIZER_DESC1</strong></a> structure members. The <strong>MaxDepthSlope</strong> value is the maximum of the horizontal and vertical slopes of the depth value at the pixel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a floating-point depth buffer is bound to the output-merger stage the bias value is calculated like this:</p>
<pre><code>Bias = (float)DepthBias * 2**(exponent(max z in primitive) - r) +
            SlopeScaledDepthBias * MaxDepthSlope;
</code></pre>
<p>where <em>r</em> is the number of mantissa bits in the floating point representation (excluding the hidden bit); for example, 23 for <strong>float32</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The bias value is then clamped like this:</p>
<pre><code>if(DepthBiasClamp &gt; 0)
    Bias = min(DepthBiasClamp, Bias)
else if(DepthBiasClamp &lt; 0)
    Bias = max(DepthBiasClamp, Bias)
</code></pre>
<p>The bias value is then used to calculate the pixel depth.</p>
<pre><code>if ( (DepthBias != 0) || (SlopeScaledDepthBias != 0) )
    z = z + Bias
</code></pre>
<p>Depth-bias operations occur on vertices after clipping, therefore, depth-bias has no effect on geometric clipping. The bias value is constant for a given primitive and is added to the z value for each vertex before interpolator setup. When you use <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro.html">feature levels</a> 10.0 and higher, all bias calculations are performed using 32-bit floating-point arithmetic. Bias is not applied to any point or line primitives, except for lines drawn in wireframe mode.</p>
<p>One of the artifacts with shadow buffer based shadows is shadow acne, or a surface shadowing itself due to minor differences between the depth computation in a shader, and the depth of the same surface in the shadow buffer. One way to alleviate this is to use <strong>DepthBias</strong> and <strong>SlopeScaledDepthBias</strong> when rendering a shadow buffer. The idea is to push surfaces out enough while rendering a shadow buffer so that the comparison result (between the shadow buffer z and the shader z) is consistent across the surface, and avoid local self-shadowing.</p>
<p>However, using <strong>DepthBias</strong> and <strong>SlopeScaledDepthBias</strong> can introduce new rendering problems when a polygon viewed at an extremely sharp angle causes the bias equation to generate a very large z value. This in effect pushes the polygon extremely far away from the original surface in the shadow map. One way to help alleviate this particular problem is to use <strong>DepthBiasClamp</strong>, which provides an upper bound (positive or negative) on the magnitude of the z bias calculated.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
For <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-devices-downlevel-intro.html">feature levels</a> 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, <strong>DepthBiasClamp</strong> is not supported.</p>

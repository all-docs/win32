<h1>Multiple-Pass Rendering</h1>
<p>Multiple-pass rendering is a process in which an application traverses its scene graph multiple times in order to produce an output to render to the display. Multiple-pass rendering improves performance because it breaks up complex scenes into tasks that can run concurrently.</p>
<p>To perform multiple-pass rendering, you create a deferred context and command list for each additional pass. While the application traverses the scene graph, it records commands (for example, rendering commands such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-draw"><strong>Draw</strong></a>) into a deferred context. After the application finishes the traversal, it calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-finishcommandlist"><strong>FinishCommandList</strong></a> method on the deferred context. Finally, the application calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-executecommandlist"><strong>ExecuteCommandList</strong></a> method on the immediate context to execute the commands in each command list.</p>
<p>The following pseudocode shows how to perform multiple-pass rendering:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>{
 ImmCtx-&gt;SetRenderTarget( pRTViewOfResourceX );
 DefCtx1-&gt;SetTexture( pSRView1OfResourceX );
 DefCtx2-&gt;SetTexture( pSRView2OfResourceX );

 for () // Traverse the scene graph.
  {
    ImmCtx-&gt;Draw(); // Pass 0: immediate context renders primitives into resource X.

    // The following texturing by the deferred contexts occurs after the 
    // immediate context makes calls to ExecuteCommandList. 
    // Resource X is then comletely updated by the immediate context. 
    DefCtx1-&gt;Draw(); // Pass 1: deferred context 1 performs texturing from resource X.
    DefCtx2-&gt;Draw(); // Pass 2: deferred context 2 performs texturing from resource X.
      }

  // Create command lists and record commands into them.
  DefCtx1-&gt;FinishCommandList( &amp;pCL1 ); 
  DefCtx2-&gt;FinishCommandList( &amp;pCL2 );

  ImmCtx-&gt;ExecuteCommandList( pCL1 ); // Execute pass 1.
  ImmCtx-&gt;ExecuteCommandList( pCL2 ); // Exeucte pass 2.
}
</code></pre>

<p>[!Note]<br />
The immediate context modifies a resource, which is bound to the immediate context as a render target view (RTV); in contrast, each deferred context simply uses the resource, which is bound to the deferred context as a shader resource view (SRV). For more information about immediate and deferred contexts, see <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-render-multi-thread-render.html">Immediate and Deferred Rendering</a>.</p>

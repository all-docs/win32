<h1>Vertex-shader stage</h1>
<p>The vertex-shader (VS) stage processes vertices from the input assembler, performing per-vertex operations such as transformations, skinning, morphing, and per-vertex lighting. Vertex shaders always operate on a single input vertex and produce a single output vertex. The vertex-shader stage must always be active for the pipeline to execute. If no vertex modification or transformation is required, a pass-through vertex shader must be created and set to the pipeline.</p>
<h2>The Vertex-shader</h2>
<p>Each vertex shader input vertex can be comprised of up to 16 32-bit vectors (up to 4 components each) and each output vertex can be comprised of as many as 16 32-bit 4-component vectors. All vertex-shaders must have a minimum of one input and one output, which can be as little as one scalar value.</p>
<p>The vertex-shader stage can consume two system generated values from the input assembler: VertexID and InstanceID (see <a href="/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-semantics#system-value-semantics">System-value semantics</a>). Since VertexID and InstanceID are both meaningful at a vertex level, and IDs generated by hardware can only be fed into the first stage that understands them, these ID values can only be fed into the vertex-shader stage.</p>
<p>Vertex shaders are always run on all vertices, including adjacent vertices in input primitive topologies with adjacency. The number of times that the vertex-shader has been executed can be queried from the CPU using the VSInvocations pipeline statistic.</p>
<p>A vertex-shader can perform load and texture sampling operations where screen-space derivatives are not required (using HLSL intrinsic functions: <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-to-sample">Sample (DirectX HLSL Texture Object)</a>, <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-to-samplecmplevelzero">SampleCmpLevelZero (DirectX HLSL Texture Object)</a>, and <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-to-samplegrad">SampleGrad (DirectX HLSL Texture Object)</a>).</p>

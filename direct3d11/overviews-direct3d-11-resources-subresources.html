<h1>Subresources (Direct3D 11 Graphics)</h1>
<p>This topic describes texture subresources, or portions of a resource.</p>
<p>Direct3D can reference an entire resource or it can reference subsets of a resource. The term subresource refers to a subset of a resource.</p>
<p>A buffer is defined as a single subresource. Textures are a little more complicated because there are several different texture types (1D, 2D, etc.) some of which support mipmap levels and/or texture arrays. Beginning with the simplest case, a 1D texture is defined as a single subresource, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/d3d10-1d-texture.png" alt="illustration of a 1d texture" /></p>
<p>This means that the array of texels that make up a 1D texture are contained in a single subresource.</p>
<p>If you expand a 1D texture with three mipmap levels, it can be visualized like the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/d3d10-resource-texture1d.png" alt="illustration of a 1d texture with three mipmap levels" /></p>
<p>Think of this as a single texture that is made up of three subresources. A subresource can be indexed using the level-of-detail (LOD) for a single texture. When using an array of textures, accessing a particular subresource requires both the LOD and the particular texture. Alternately, the API combines these two pieces of information into a single zero-based subresource index, as shown in the following illustration.</p>

<h2>Selecting Subresources</h2>
<p>Some APIs access an entire resource (for example the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-copyresource"><strong>ID3D11DeviceContext::CopyResource</strong></a> method), others access a portion of a resource (for example the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-updatesubresource"><strong>ID3D11DeviceContext::UpdateSubresource</strong></a> method or the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-copysubresourceregion"><strong>ID3D11DeviceContext::CopySubresourceRegion</strong></a> method). The methods that access a portion of a resource generally use a view description (such as the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_tex2d_array_dsv"><strong>D3D11_TEX2D_ARRAY_DSV</strong></a> structure) to specify the subresources to access.</p>
<p>The illustrations in the following sections show the terms used by a view description when accessing an array of textures.</p>
<h3>Array Slice</h3>
<p>Given an array of textures, each texture with mipmaps, an <em>array slice</em> (represented by the white rectangle) includes one texture and all of its subresources, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/d3d10-resource-array-slice.png" alt="illustration of an array slice" /></p>
<h3>Mip Slice</h3>
<p>A <em>mip slice</em> (represented by the white rectangle) includes one mipmap level for every texture in an array, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/d3d10-resource-mip-slice.png" alt="illustration of a mip slice" /></p>
<h3>Selecting a Single Subresource</h3>
<p>You can use these two types of slices to choose a single subresource, as shown in the following illustration.</p>
<p><img src="images/d3d10-resource-subresources-1.png" alt="illustration of choosing a subresource by using an array slice and a mip slice" /></p>
<h3>Selecting Multiple Subresources</h3>
<p>Or you can use these two types of slices with the number of mipmap levels and/or number of textures, to choose multiple subresources, as shown in the following illustration.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_render_target_view_desc"><strong>render-target view</strong></a> can only use a single subresource or mip slice and cannot include subresources from more than one mip slice. That is, every texture in a render-target view must be the same size. A <a href="/windows/desktop/api/d3d11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_shader_resource_view_desc"><strong>shader-resource view</strong></a> can select any rectangular region of subresources, as shown in the figure.</p>

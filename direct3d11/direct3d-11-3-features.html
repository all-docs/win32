<td><a href="conservative-rasterization.html">Conservative Rasterization</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Conservative rasterization adds some certainty to pixel rendering, which is helpful in particular to collision detection algorithms.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="default-texture-mapping.html">Default Texture Mapping</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The use of default texture mapping reduces copying and memory usage while sharing image data between the GPU and the CPU. However, it should only be used in specific situations. The standard swizzle layout avoids copying or swizzling data in multiple layouts.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="rasterizer-order-views.html">Rasterizer Order Views</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Rasterizer ordered views (ROVs) allow pixel shader code to mark UAV bindings with a declaration that alters the normal requirements for the order of graphics pipeline results for UAVs. This enables Order Independent Transparency (OIT) algorithms to work, which give much better rendering results when multiple transparent objects are in line with each other in a view. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="shader-specified-stencil-reference-value.html">Shader Specified Stencil Reference Value</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Enabling pixel shaders to output the Stencil Reference Value, rather than using the API-specified one, enables a very fine granular control over stencil operations.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="typed-unordered-access-view-loads.html">Typed Unordered Access View Loads</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Unordered Access View (UAV) Typed Load is the ability for a shader to read from a UAV with a specific DXGI_FORMAT.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="unified-memory-architecture.html">Unified Memory Architecture</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Querying for whether Unified Memory Architecture (UMA) is supported can help determine how to handle some resources.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="volume-tiled-resources.html">Volume Tiled Resources</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Volume (3D) textures can be used as tiled resources, noting that tile resolution is three-dimensional.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

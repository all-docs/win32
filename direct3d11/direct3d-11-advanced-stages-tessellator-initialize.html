<h1>How To: Initialize the Tessellator Stage</h1>
<p>In general, tessellation expands the compact, user-defined, model of a patch into geometry that contains a programmable amount of detail. The geometry is typically a set of triangles that represents detailed surface geometry. This topic shows how to initialize the tessellator stage.</p>
<p>The tessellator stage is the second of three stages that work together to tessellate or tile a surface. The first stage is the hull-shader stage; it operates once per patch and configures how the next stage (the fixed function tessellator) behaves. A hull shader also generates user-defined outputs such as output-control points and patch constants that are sent past the tessellator directly to the third stage, the domain-shader stage. A domain shader is invoked once per tessellator-stage point and evaluates surface positions.</p>
<p>The tessellator stage is a fixed function stage, there is no shader to generate, and no state to set. It receives all of its setup state from the hull-shader stage; once the hull-shader stage has been initialized, the tessellator stage is automatically initialized.</p>
<p><strong>To initialize the tessellator stage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initialize the hull-shader stage using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11devicecontext-hssetshader"><strong>ID3D11DeviceContext::HSSetShader</strong></a>.</p>
<pre><code>void HSSetShader(
  ID3D11HullShader *pHullShader,  
  ID3D11ClassInstance *const *ppClassInstances,
  UINT NumClassInstances
);
</code></pre>
<p><em>ppClassInstances</em> is a pointer to an array of shader interfaces, represented by <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nn-d3d11-id3d11classinstance"><strong>ID3D11ClassInstance</strong></a> pointers and the number of interfaces, represented by <em>NumClassInstances</em>. If not used, these parameters can be set to <strong>NULL</strong> and 0 respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the hull-shader stage is initialized, you should also initialize the domain-shader stage.</p>

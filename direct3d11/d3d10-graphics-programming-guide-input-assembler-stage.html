<h1>Input-Assembler Stage</h1>
<p>The Direct3D 10 and higher API separates functional areas of the pipeline into stages; the first stage in the pipeline is the input-assembler (IA) stage.</p>
<p>The purpose of the input-assembler stage is to read primitive data (points, lines and/or triangles) from user-filled buffers and assemble the data into primitives that will be used by the other pipeline stages. The IA stage can assemble vertices into several different <a href="d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-primitive-topologies.html">primitive types</a> (such as line lists, triangle strips, or primitives with adjacency). New primitive types (such as a line list with adjacency or a triangle list with adjacency) have been added to support the geometry shader.</p>
<p>Adjacency information is visible to an application only in a geometry shader. If a geometry shader were invoked with a triangle including adjacency, for instance, the input data would contain 3 vertices for each triangle and 3 vertices for adjacency data per triangle.</p>
<p>When the input-assembler stage is requested to output adjacency data, the input data must include adjacency data. This may require providing a dummy vertex (forming a degenerate triangle), or perhaps by flagging in one of the vertex attributes whether the vertex exists or not. This would also need to be detected and handled by a geometry shader, although culling of degenerate geometry will happen in the rasterizer stage.</p>
<p>While assembling primitives, a secondary purpose of the IA is to attach <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-semantics">system-generated values</a> to help make shaders more efficient. System-generated values are text strings that are also called semantics. All three shader stages are constructed from a common shader core, and the shader core uses system-generated values (such as a primitive id, an instance id, or a vertex id) so that a shader stage can reduce processing to only those primitives, instances, or vertices that have not already been processed.</p>
<p>As shown in the <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3d10/d3d10-graphics-programming-guide-pipeline-stages">pipeline-block diagram</a>, once the IA stage reads data from memory (assembles the data into primitives and attaches system-generated values), the data is output to the <a href="/previous-versions//bb205146(v=vs.85)">vertex shader stage</a>.</p>

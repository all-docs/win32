<h1>Pipeline access to tiled resources</h1>
<p>Tiled resources can be used in shader resource views (SRV), render target views (RTV), depth stencil views (DSV) and unordered access views (UAV), as well as some bind points where views aren't used, such as vertex buffer bindings. For the list of supported bindings, see <a href="tiled-resource-creation-parameters.html">Tiled resource creation parameters</a>. Copy* operations also work on tiled resources.</p>
<p>If multiple tile coordinates in one or more views is bound to the same memory location, reads and writes from different paths to the same memory will occur in a non-deterministic and non-repeatable order of memory accesses.</p>
<p>If all tiles behind a memory access footprint from a shader are mapped to unique tiles, behavior is identical on all implementations to the surface having the same memory contents in a non-tiled fashion.</p>
<p>This section provides more info about pipeline access to tiled resources.</p>

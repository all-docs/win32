<h1>Tier 1</h1>
<p>This section describes tier 1 support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware at feature level 11.0 minimum.</li>
<li>No quilting support.</li>
<li>No Texture1D or Texture3D support.</li>
<li>No 2, 8 or 16 sample multisample antialiasing (MSAA) support. Only 4x is required, except no 128 bpp formats.</li>
<li>No standard swizzle pattern (layout within 64KB tiles and tail mip packing is up to the hardware vendor).</li>
<li>Limitations on how tiles can be accessed when there are duplicate mappings, described in <a href="tile-access-limitations-with-duplicate-mappings-.html">Tile access limitations with duplicate mappings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations affecting tier 1 only</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tiled resources can have <strong>NULL</strong> mappings but reading from them or writing to them produces undefined results, including device removed. Applications can get around this by mapping a single dummy page to all the empty areas. Take care if you write and render to a page that is mapped to multiple render target locations because the order of writes will be undefined.</li>
<li>Shader instructions for clamping LOD and mapped status feedback are not available. For more info, see <a href="hlsl-tiled-resources-exposure.html">HLSL tiled resources exposure</a>.</li>
<li>Alignment constraints for standard tile shapes: It is only guaranteed that mips (starting from the finest) whose dimensions are all multiples of the standard tile size support the standard tile shapes and can have individual tiles arbitrarily mapped/unmapped. The first mipmap in a tiled resource that has any dimension not a multiple of standard tile size, along with all coarser mipmaps, can have a non-standard tiling shape, fitting into N 64KB tiles for this set of mips at once (N reported to the application). These N tiles are considered packed as one unit, which must be either fully mapped or fully unmapped by the application at any given time, though the mappings of each of the N tiles can be at arbitrarily disjoint locations in a tile pool.</li>
<li>Tiled resources with any mipmaps not a multiple of standard tile size in all dimensions are not allowed to have an array size larger than 1.</li>
<li>In order to switch between referencing tiles in a tile pool via a <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-resources-buffers.html">Buffer</a> resource to referencing the same tiles via a <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-resources-textures.html">Texture</a> resource, or vice-versa, the most recent call to <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11_2/nf-d3d11_2-id3d11devicecontext2-updatetilemappings"><strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11_2/nf-d3d11_2-id3d11devicecontext2-copytilemappings"><strong>CopyTileMappings</strong></a> that defines mappings to those tile pool tiles must be for the same resource dimension (Buffer versus Texture*) as the resource dimension that will be used to access the tiles. Otherwise, behavior is undefined including the chance of device reset. So, for example, calling <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> to define tile mappings for a Buffer, then <strong>UpdateTileMappings</strong> to the same tiles in the tile pool via a <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/sm5-object-texture2d"><strong>Texture2D</strong></a> resource, then accessing the tiles via the Buffer is invalid. Work-around operations are to either redefine tile mappings for a resource when switching between Buffer and Texture (or vice versa) sharing tiles or just never sharing tiles in a tile pool between Buffer resources and Texture resources.</li>
<li>Min/Max reduction filtering is not supported. For info about Min/Max reduction filtering, see <a href="tiled-resources-texture-sampling-features.html">Tiled resources texture sampling features</a>.</li>

<h1>Tile pool creation</h1>
<p>A tile pool is created via the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-createbuffer"><strong>ID3D11Device::CreateBuffer</strong></a> API by passing the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_resource_misc_flag"><strong>D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_TILE_POOL</strong></a> flag in the <strong>MiscFlags</strong> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_buffer_desc"><strong>D3D11_BUFFER_DESC</strong></a> structure that the <em>pDesc</em> parameter points to.</p>
<p>Applications can create one or more tile pools per Direct3D device. The total size of each tile pool is restricted to Direct3DÂ 11's resource size limit, which is roughly 1/4 of graphics processing unit (GPU) RAM.</p>
<p>A tile pool is made of 64KB tiles, but the operating system (display driver) manages the entire pool as one or more allocations behind the scenesâ€”the breakdown is not visible to applications. Tiled resources define content by pointing at tiles within a tile pool. Unmapping a tile from a tiled resource is done by pointing the tile to <strong>NULL</strong>. Such unmapped tiles have rules about the behavior of reads or writes. For info, see <a href="hazard-tracking-versus-tile-pool-resources.html">Hazard tracking versus tile pool resources</a>.</p>

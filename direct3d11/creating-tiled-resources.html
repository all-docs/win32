<h1>Creating tiled resources</h1>
<p>Tiled resources are created by specifying the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_resource_misc_flag"><strong>D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_TILED</strong></a> flag when you create a resource.</p>
<p>Restrictions on when you can use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/ne-d3d11-d3d11_resource_misc_flag"><strong>D3D11_RESOURCE_MISC_TILED</strong></a> to create a resource are described in <a href="tiled-resource-creation-parameters.html">Tiled resource creation parameters</a>.</p>
<p>A non-tiled resource's storage is allocated in the graphics system when the resource is created. For example, when you call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/D3D11/nf-d3d11-id3d11device-createtexture2d"><strong>ID3D11Device::CreateTexture2D</strong></a> to create an array of 2D textures, the graphics system allocates storage for those 2D textures. When a tiled resource is created, the graphics system doesn't allocate the storage for the resource contents. Instead, when an application creates a tiled resource, the graphics system makes an address space reservation for the tiled surface's area only, and then allows the mapping of the tiles to be controlled by the application. The &quot;mapping&quot; of a tile is simply the physical location in memory that a logical tile in a resource points to (or <strong>NULL</strong> for an unmapped tile). Don't confuse this concept with the notion of mapping a Direct3D resource for CPU access, which despite using the same name is completely independent. You will be able to define and change the mapping of each tile individually as needed, knowing that all tiles for a surface don't need to be mapped at a time, thereby making effective use of the amount of memory available.</p>
<p>This section provides more info about how to create tiled resources.</p>

<h1>Buffer tiling</h1>
<p>A <a href="overviews-direct3d-11-resources-buffers.html">Buffer</a> resource is divided into 64KB tiles, with some empty space in the last tile if the size is not a multiple of 64KB.</p>
<p>Structured buffers must have no constraint on the stride to be tiled. But possible performance optimizations in hardware for using <a href="/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/sm5-object-structuredbuffer"><strong>StructuredBuffers</strong></a> can be sacrificed by making them tiled in the first place.</p>

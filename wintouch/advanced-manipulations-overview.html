<h1>Advanced Manipulations Overview</h1>
<p>This section explains advanced manipulations for applications.</p>
<p>For usability purposes, you may want to add complex manipulations to your application so that objects can be manipulated with a fine degree of granularity. The following sections describe advanced manipulations.</p>
<h3>Advanced Expansion</h3>
<p>The following illustration shows two interpretations of expansion.</p>
<p><img src="images/expansion.png" alt="illustration showing simple expansion around an object's center point, and advanced expansion around the center point of the manipulation" /></p>
<p>In example A, the simple expansion example, the object is expanded around its center point. In example B, the object is expanded around the center point of the manipulation.</p>
<h3>Advanced Rotation</h3>
<p>The following illustration shows two interpretations of rotation.</p>
<p><img src="images/rotation.png" alt="illustration showing two types of single-finger rotation: around the center or around the edge, with the edge involving both rotation and translation" /></p>
<p>In example A, the simple rotation example, the object is rotated around its center point. In example B, the object is rotated around the center point of the manipulation. For more information on complex rotation, see the <a href="advanced-rotation.html">Advanced Rotation</a> section.</p>
<h2>Advanced Translation</h2>
<p>The following illustration shows two interpretations of translation.</p>
<p><img src="images/translation.png" alt="illustration showing simple translation, in which an object is moved without rotation, and advanced translation, which involves moving and rotation" /></p>
<p>In example A, the simple translation example, the object is moved without rotation. In example B, the object is rotated during the translation depending on where the object contact point is. If you enable single-finger rotation as described in <a href="single-finger-rotation.html">Single-Finger Rotation</a>, you can enable complex translation.</p>

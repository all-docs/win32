<h1>Manipulations</h1>
<p>This section explains object manipulation for Windows Touch.</p>
<h2>Manipulation Overview</h2>
<p>A convenient way to think about manipulations is to consider them a superset of gestures. What you can do with gestures, you can do with more flexibility and with finer precision by using manipulations. The difference between manipulations and gestures is best demonstrated with a simple example. You can expand an object and at the same time translate it using manipulations; with gestures, you can do only one at a time. This ability to manipulate an object in real time makes applications more intuitive to users by enabling a more realistic experience.</p>
<p>The Manipulation APIs are used to simplify transformation operations on objects for touch-enabled applications. Manipulations are performed in WindowsÂ 7 through the manipulations COM object. By using manipulations, developers can more easily support inertia (object physics) and can easily perform transformations on objects in a way that is consistent with other applications. The following sections explain various ways that you can perform manipulations.</p>

<h1>Writing an Event Reference Page</h1>
<p>Use event reference pages (ERPs) to describe how to solve a problem that is detected by the expert. Because ERPs consist of HTML text, you can use any HTML editor or text editor to create one.</p>
<p>The Network Monitor Event browser pane that displays the ERP supports all the functionality of Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 and later. Embed any supported controls or scripted language in your ERP to display information or launch other functionality from your ERP. For example, you can create a control that sends e-mail to network operations.</p>

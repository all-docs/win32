<h1>Monitor Architecture</h1>
<p>The following figure shows the relationship between <a href="m.html"><em>monitors</em></a> and other components of the Network Monitor architecture.</p>
<p><img src="images/nmarch2.png" alt="relationship between monitors and other components of network monitor" /></p>
<p>The network traffic is collected (as individual frames) from the NDIS driver. The Network Monitor driver (Nmnt.sys) then routes the frames to a network packet provider (NPP), which in turn captures the data in real-time mode. The NPP is a collection of COM interfaces used to capture data. In this case, the <a href="irtc.html"><strong>IRTC</strong></a> interface is used to perform a real-time capture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
The NPP is used for delayed and real-time captures. For delayed captures used by experts and parsers, the <a href="idelaydc.html"><strong>IDelaydC</strong></a> interface is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The monitor then examines the captured data in real-time mode, detecting specific network conditions and generating events as required.</p>
<p>Three other components are used by monitor applications: the Monitor Control Tool, the Monitor Control Service (MCSVC), and the Event Viewer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Monitor Control Tool is used to manage your monitor applications. This includes configuring and running all your monitor applications.</li>
<li>The Monitor Control Service (MCSVC) fires events, provides a communications link to WMI for event viewing, and coordinates the processing of monitor operations.</li>
<li>The Event Viewer displays the events fired by the Monitor Control Service.</li>
</ul>

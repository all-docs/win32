<h1>Monitor Configuration (Network Monitor)</h1>
<p>Monitors can be configured using the Network Monitor UI. End-users can pass configuration criteria to your monitor using an HTML form stored as an HTM file in the following sub folder of your installed Network Monitor SDK.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>%SystemRoot%\System32\Npp\Monitors
</code></pre>
<p>When an end user selects the <strong>Set Monitor Configuration</strong> button, the browser generates an HTML <strong>POST</strong> message, which includes the names and values for all the HTML form elements.</p>
<p>When the MCSVC calls the <a href="imonitor-doconfigure.html">IMonitor::DoConfigure</a> method, the <em>pConfiguration</em> parameter points to the data from the POST message. The following example code provides an example of POST message data:</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>ConfigString=&quot;FilePath=c%3A%5Ccaptures&amp;StartingNumber=50 \ 
    &amp;EndingNumber=256&amp;MaximumNumberEver=10000 \ 
    &amp;TimeBetweenNotification=120&amp;\
    Addresses=157.54.23.23%0D%0A157.54.23.22% 0D%0A
</code></pre>
<p>This data is passed in as a long ASCII string. The string looks peculiar, both for its length and the appearance of sections such as %3A%5C and %0D%0A. This peculiarity is caused by HTML, which requires that a method put all possible ANSI, DBCS, and Unicode strings into an ASCII format. For example, the <strong>DoConfigure</strong> method inserts certain characters such as the ampersand (&amp;) in front of each variable name to identify it as a variable name. The %3A%5C is an encoded form of the colon character, and %0D%0A indicates a carriage return/linefeed pair. The following example code provides the resulting HTML code as interpreted by the monitor.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>FilePath = c:\captures
StartingNumber=50
EndingNumber = 256
MaximumNumberEver = 10000
TimeBetweenNotification = 120
Addresses= {157.54.23.23, 157.54.23.22}
</code></pre>

<h1>Building an Expert</h1>
<p>This topic describes how to build a generic expert that ships with the Network Monitor SDK.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Before creating the following code examples, install the Network Monitor SDK and initialize the MySetEnv.bat file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p><strong>To build a generic expert</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open a Network Monitor command prompt and navigate to the \Experts subdirectory; for example, C:\Program Files\NetMonSDK2\Experts.</li>
<li>Type <strong>xcopy /e /s /v Blrplate MyExpert</strong>; then, when prompted, type <strong>D</strong>.</li>
<li>Move to the \MyExpert subdirectory.</li>
<li>Type <strong>ren Blrplate*.* MyExpert*.*</strong>. Ensure that all files are properly renamed. Verify the file names by comparing the files in the \Experts\Blrplate subdirectory.</li>
<li>Edit the Makefile by replacing all occurrences of <strong>Blrplate</strong> with <strong>MyExpert</strong>.</li>
<li>Edit both .cpp files by replacing all occurrences of <strong>Blrplate</strong> with <strong>MyExpert</strong>. Be aware that the dialog box identifier in Config.cpp must be capitalized (for example, <strong>MYEXPERT</strong>).</li>
<li>Edit MyExpert.h by replacing all occurrences of <strong>Blrplate</strong> with <strong>MyExpert</strong>.</li>
<li>Edit Resrc1.h by renaming <strong>BLRPLATE</strong> to <strong>MYEXPERT</strong>. (Remember, <strong>MYEXPERT</strong> must be capitalized).</li>
<li>Edit the MyExpert.rc file by renaming <strong>IDD_BLRPLATE_CONFIG_DIALOG</strong> to <strong>IDD_MYEXPERT_CONFIG_DIALOG</strong>.</li>
<li>Type <strong>nmake</strong> to build the DLL file. To verify the build, change directory to the \Obj subdirectory and verify that the file exists. For more information, see <a href="viewing-expert-dll-properties.html">Viewing Expert DLL Properties</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the build is complete, you will have an expert DLL that you can test and deploy with Network Monitor.

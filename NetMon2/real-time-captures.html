<h1>Real-Time Captures</h1>
<p>Monitors receive captured network frames in real-time mode. The frames are captured by a <a href="n.html"><em>network packet provider</em></a> (NPP) using the provider's <a href="irtc.html">IRTC</a> COM interface, and passed on to the monitor in one of the monitor's two execution threads.</p>
<p>Monitors can limit the number of frames they have to process by passing a <a href="c.html"><em>capture filter</em></a> to the NPP that is supplying the frames. Typically, a specific monitor is designed to watch for specific types of traffic, such as HTTP, RIPX, or SMB. Unlike experts, which use sophisticated parsers to select the information to be analyzed, a monitor must examine each frame for the conditions it was designed to detect. The reason behind this frame-by-frame approach is performance. A monitor must process its frames quickly enough so that it does not fall behind the driver supplying the frames to the NPP. Otherwise, data will be lost.</p>

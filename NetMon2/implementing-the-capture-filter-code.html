<h1>Implementing the Capture Filter Code</h1>
<p>After you determine how to organize your filter through a <a href="capturefilter.html"><strong>CAPTUREFILTER</strong></a> structure, you must allocate and fill in the structure, which is then passed to the Network Monitor driver through a configuration BLOB.</p>
<p>Direct NPP users add the capture filter to the configuration BLOB that is passed to <strong>Connect</strong>, <a href="configure.html"><strong>Configure</strong></a>, or both. For a list of COM interfaces that you can use to communicate with the NPP, see <a href="npp-interfaces.html">NPP Interfaces</a>.</p>

<h1>Network Monitor Architecture</h1>
<p>The Network Monitor architecture can be separated into two sets of programming concepts, those related to <a href="e.html"><em>expert</em></a> and <a href="p.html"><em>parser</em></a> development and those related to <a href="m.html"><em>monitor</em></a> development.</p>
<p>Although both use the same components to capture the network traffic, they each use different interfaces to capture the data and different components to analyze what was captured.</p>

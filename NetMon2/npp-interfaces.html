<h1>NPP Interfaces</h1>
<p>Network packet providers (NPPs) provide COM interfaces that are called by NPP applications, and Network Monitor. When you call <a href="createnppinterface.html">CreateNPPInterface</a>, remember that each NPP is represented as a single in-process COM object. Applications can instantiate any number of NPP objects. However, each instantiated object must use oneâ€”and only oneâ€”of the five NPP interfaces.</p>
<p>Note also that different NPP interfaces provide network data in various forms. For example, Network Monitor uses the <strong>IDelaydC</strong> interface to capture network traffic and save it to a capture file; while monitors use the <strong>IRTC</strong> interface to capture real time network traffic. The following table describes Network Monitor NPP interfaces.</p>
<table>

<th>Interface</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="idelaydc.html">IDelaydC</a></td>
<td>Captures network traffic that is stored in a capture file. This interface is used by Network Monitor and NPP applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="iesp.html">IESP</a></td>
<td>Captures network traffic that is stored in a capture file and provides enhanced statistics in a special ESP file format. This interface is used by NPP applications</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="irtc.html">IRTC</a></td>
<td>Captures real time network traffic and triggers events when they occur. This interface is used by <a href="m.html"><em>monitors</em></a> and NPP applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="istats.html">IStats</a></td>
<td>Retrieves statistics as raw data rather than frames. This interface is used by NPP applications such as <a href="p.html"><em>Perfmon</em></a>.</td>
</tr>

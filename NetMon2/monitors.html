<h1>Monitors</h1>
<p>A monitor is a dynamic-link library (DLL) that examines real-time captures of network traffic. It searches for pre-defined conditions and then generates events when those conditions are detected. For example, an event may be fired when a network break-in is attempted, when a rogue workstation is handing out IP addresses, or when a router fails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If you need to perform detailed analyses on network data that requires a post-capture analysis, you must use <a href="e.html"><em>expert</em></a> and <a href="p.html"><em>parser</em></a> applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The <a href="m.html"><em>Monitor Control Service</em></a> (MCSVC) provides the framework for managing your monitors. It provides functions to load the monitor DLLs, and a communications interface to the Monitor Control Tool so that you can create, configure, start, stop, and disable multiple instances of your monitors.</p>
<p>Monitors run in two threads of execution. The MCSVC provides the first thread, which provides direct control of the monitor. The second thread is provided by the <a href="n.html"><em>network packet provider</em></a> (NPP), which provides a way to pass the captured network data, statistics, and the status of the capture from the NPP back to the monitor.</p>
<p>More than one instance of the same monitor can exist for each run-time NPP interface used to capture data.</p>

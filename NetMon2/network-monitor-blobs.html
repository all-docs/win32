<h1>Network Monitor BLOBs</h1>
<p>The Network Monitor binary large object (BLOB) is a generic data structure that contains configuration and location information of network interface cards (NICs). Use BLOBs to represent NICs and to filter entries in a list of NICs. BLOBS can also contain application-specific data without affecting the other data that they hold. BLOB implementation is opaque to all levels that must access BLOBs with BLOB APIs.</p>
<h2>BLOB Structure</h2>
<p>A BLOB can be considered as a hierarchical tree used to designate strings. This tree has three layers: Owner, Category, and Tag. Owner is a string that indicates, in general, who reads an entry. The Category is also a string, which designates a general functional grouping of tags under the owner. The Tag is the actual name of the entry.</p>
<p>The structural characteristics of BLOBs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>BLOB helpers within one process are protected from one another by a mutex built into each BLOB.</li>
<li>Each BLOB has an internal version number so that the helpers can handle both present and future BLOB forms. Version conflicts may occur if you send a BLOB to another computer via a remote procedure call.</li>
<li>The BLOB itself is a pointer to a void. Be aware that applications should allocate BLOBs with the <strong>const</strong> modifier to avoid altering the contents.</li>
<li>Each of the designators, as well as their values, are strings. Be aware that the strings returned by <strong>GetString</strong> functions are actually pointers into the BLOB and should not be changed. For this reason, these strings must be specified as <strong>const char</strong>**pX* to keep applications from accidentally changing them.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, all parameters with the <strong>const</strong> designator encourage the caller to refrain from changing the values rather than prohibit the helper functions from changing them. In fact, the helper functions will usually change those values.</p>

<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>A large number of resources were created. Although Direct2D has no upper bound on the number of available resources (except memory), the debug layer issues this informational message when it encounters 1001 live objects, 2001 live objects, or 3001 live objects etc, because this might indicate a leak in the application.</p>

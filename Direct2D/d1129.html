<h1>D1129: DXGI Format Incompatible With Alpha Mode</h1>
<p>The combination of alpha mode and DXGI format supplied are not compatible with one another.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>For Direct2D operations which use a surface format and alpha mode, there are cases in which the surface format and the alpha mode do not agree. For example, a surface format such as DXGI_FORMAT_A8_UNORM would not make sense to be used with IGNORE alpha, since it renders only to an alpha channel. Additionally, straight alpha is not supported with some DXGI_FORMATs, but premultiplied alpha is.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>See <a href="supported-pixel-formats-and-alpha-modes.html">Supported Pixel Formats and Alpha Modes</a> for guidance concerning which format combinations are supported and which are not. Modify the application to use a supported format combination.</p>

<h1>D1181: EndDraw Incorrect State</h1>
<p>EndDraw was called, but the rendertarget was not in a valid state. This may result from calling EndDraw without a matching BeginDraw.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>The application made multiple calls to EndDraw without calling BeginDraw on the same target. While using Direct2D, applications should match each call to EndDraw with a prior call to BeginDraw. Alternatively, this message may occur if the target is in an erroneous state and was not renderable.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Ensure that each call to BeginDraw is matched with a subsequent EndDraw. When submitting commands to a target using Flush or EndDraw, verify that the returned result is S_OK before attempting to use the target again.</p>

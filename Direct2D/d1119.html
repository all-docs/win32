<h1>D1119: Bitmap Bound As Target</h1>
<p>A drawing operation failed because the target bitmap and a source bitmap were the same.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>A likely cause of this message is that the application attempted a drawing operation where the same bitmap was used for both the source and target. Semantically, this is possible for interoperated Direct3D textures with both BIND_SHADER_RESOURCE and BIND_RENDER_TARGET.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Ensure that the application does not attempt to use its target bitmap as the source of a drawing operation, including effects. In some cases, this message may indicate that the application set its device contextâ€™s target to a different bitmap than intended.</p>

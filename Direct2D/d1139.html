<h1>D1139: Unused Stroke Width</h1>
<p>A stroke transform type of HAIRLINE was specified, but the stroke width supplied was not 1. The stroke width will be ignored.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>The application drew a primitive using an ID2D1StrokeStyle with D2D1_STROKE_TRANSFORM_TYPE_HAIRLINE, but the stroke width used in that draw call was not 1. When the hairline attribute is specified, it, in fact, overrides the stroke width, fixing it at 1.0 device-dependent units, regardless of scale transform or DPI choice.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>When the HAIRLINE attribute is set on an ID2D1StrokeStyle, the application should use a stroke width of 1.0 units.</p>

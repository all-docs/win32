<h1>D1249: Inaccessible Target</h1>
<p>An attempt to draw to an inaccessible target has been detected.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>An attempt to draw to an inaccessible target has been detected. One reason a target may be inaccessible is if it was created from a shared texture and the texture was not acquired.</p>

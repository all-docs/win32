<h1>D1203: CopyFromBitmap With Multisampled Source</h1>
<p>CopyFromBitmap was used with a multisampled source bitmap. The call will still be issued, but the copied result will may not represent the multisample pattern expected.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>The application interoperated a multisampled Direct3D texture as a Direct2D bitmap, and called CopyFromBitmap on the bitmap.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Avoid interoperating multisampled textures as bitmaps if CopyFromBitmap functionality is important. The copied result may not represent the multisample pattern expected.</p>

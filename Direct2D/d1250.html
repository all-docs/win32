<h1>D1250: Inaccessible Source</h1>
<p>An attempt to draw from an inaccessible bitmap has been detected.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>An attempt to draw from an inaccessible source has been detected. One reason a source may be inaccessible is if it was created from a shared texture and the texture was not acquired.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Make sure all bitmaps are accessible before drawing them with Direct2D.</p>

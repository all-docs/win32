<h1>D1160: Cycle In Graph</h1>
<p>An attempt was made to draw an image graph with a cycle in it.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>Direct2D allows applications to construct effect graphs for flexibility in effect behavior. Applications should not, however, create an effect graph which contains a cycle. For example, consider an effect graph contains with nodes A, B, and C: it is invalid to link A to B, then B to C, then C to A as well. Direct2D will identify cyclic effect graphs and report an error; the debug layer will output this message.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>To avoid this message, refrain from creating effect graphs which have a cycle. Design effect graphs effectively, including at least one node which acts as output only.</p>

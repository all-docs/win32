<h1>D1137: Unclosed Command List</h1>
<p>A command list was referenced that had either not been populated or had not been unset from the device context.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>This message may occur during an attempt to draw or stream a command list before its ID2D1CommandList::Close operation was called. Direct2D does not consider a command list to be valid until it has been populated; using the Close method indicates that a command list is finished being populated. If the application will use the command list for a drawing operation, the device context it uses must not have the command list set as its target.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Before attempting to use a command list, call its ID2D1CommandList::Close method. If the command list will be drawn using ID2D1DeviceContext::DrawImage or as the source of an image brush, ensure that the command list is not the current target of the corresponding device context.</p>

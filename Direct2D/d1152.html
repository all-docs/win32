<h1>D1152: Command List Closed Twice</h1>
<p>An attempt was made to close a command list for a second time.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>After populating a command list, it need only be closed once. Direct2D considers subsequent calls to ID2D1CommandList::Close to be an error.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>To avoid this message, ensure that a command list is only closed once. If an application uses callbacks or recursive code paths to interact with command lists, ensure that its behavior is correct.</p>

<h1>D1150: Unsupported Mip Level Selection</h1>
<p>The IDXGISurface2 supplied has multiple mip levels, but mip level selection is not supported on this device level (D3D9).</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>Interopped Direct3D textures may be mip-mapped; Direct2D will only operate on one mip level at a time. Other mip levels of the parent texture will be not be affected or rendered to by Direct2D. However, feature level 9 devices do not support mip level selection and cannot use this interoperability feature.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>For applications which are expected to run properly on feature level 9 devices, consider modifying the rendering logic to avoid the need to interoperate mipmapped textures. If possible, interoperate an intermediate instead. To minimize the effects of working around this limitation, the application may choose to implement this as a feature level 9-specific fallback path.</p>

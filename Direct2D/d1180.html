<h1>D1180: BeginDraw Incorrect State</h1>
<p>BeginDraw was called multiple times, without a corresponding call to EndDraw.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>The application made multiple calls to BeginDraw without calling EndDraw on the same target. While using Direct2D, applications should match each call to BeginDraw with a subsequent EndDraw. Alternatively, this message may occur if the target is in an erroneous state, and the BeginDraw call did not allow the target to be renderable.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Ensure that each call to BeginDraw is matched with a subsequent EndDraw. When submitting commands to a target using Flush or EndDraw, verify that the returned result is S_OK before attempting to use the target again.</p>

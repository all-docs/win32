<h1>D1251: D3D State Issue</h1>
<p>The state of the Direct3D device changed when Direct2D was still using it. This may be indicative of a threading violation because only one thread may use the device at a time.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>The application may be using a single threaded D2D Factory on two different threads at the same time.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Make sure that the application is properly respecting Direct2D's threading policies.</p>

<h1>D1148: Invalid Operation On Closed Print Control</h1>
<p>Direct2D Print: <a href="/windows/win32/api/d2d1_1/nf-d2d1_1-id2d1printcontrol-addpage"><strong>AddPage</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/win32/api/d2d1_1/nf-d2d1_1-id2d1printcontrol-close"><strong>Close</strong></a> is called after <a href="/windows/win32/api/d2d1_1/nn-d2d1_1-id2d1printcontrol"><strong>ID2D1PrintControl</strong></a> was closed</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>This message may occur if an application calls ID2D1PrintControl::AddPage on a print control which has been closed. Direct2D considers print control objects to be unchangeable after they are closed, in a similar manner as path geometries and command lists.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Ensure that the application does not attempt to add pages to a closed print control. Modify application logic so that all required pages are sent to a print control before it is closed.</p>

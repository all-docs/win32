<h1>D1233: BeginDraw Invalid From Previous Error</h1>
<p>BeginDraw was called but will be ignored because the device context is in an invalid state.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>The application called BeginDraw, but the device context was in an invalid state from a previous operation.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>Ensure that the application responds appropriately to errors returned by Flush or EndDraw, recreating its device as necessary. If a command caused a device context to be in an invalid state, the corresponding Flush or EndDraw will return an error.</p>

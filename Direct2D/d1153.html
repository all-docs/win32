<h1>D1153: Closed Command Lists Cannot Be Set As Targets</h1>
<p>An attempt was made to set a closed command list on a target.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Possible Causes</h2>
<p>After a command list has been closed, an application should not attempt to set it as a target. Direct2D considers this call to ID2D1DeviceContext::SetTarget to be an error because a command listâ€™s content cannot change after it has been closed. Setting a command list as a target indicates an intent to render to it.</p>
<h2>Possible Fixes</h2>
<p>To address this message, do not call ID2D1DeviceContext::SetTarget with a command list that has been closed. If it is necessary to use a command list with new, different content, create a new command list.</p>

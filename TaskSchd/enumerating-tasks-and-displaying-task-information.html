<h1>Enumerating Tasks and Displaying Task Information</h1>
<p>Displaying information about a task, such as the task name, state, or the last time the task was run, is done by enumerating through running tasks or the tasks in a task folder and displaying the desired information.</p>
<h2>Accessing Properties of Registered Tasks</h2>
<p>To display a registered task's property value, you must connect to the Task Scheduler service, and then get an instance of the task folder that contains the tasks you want information about. You then get a collection of all the registered tasks in the task folder. Then you enumerate through each registered task and get and display a property value for each task.</p>
<h2>Accessing Properties of Running Tasks</h2>
<p>To display a running task's property value, you must connect to the Task Scheduler service, and then get a collection of all the running tasks (including or excluding hidden tasks). Then you enumerate through each running task and get and display a property value for each task.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following examples enumerate tasks and display the name and state of the tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="displaying-task-names-and-state--scripting-.html">Displaying Task Names and States (Scripting)</a></li>
<li><a href="displaying-task-names-and-state--c---.html">Displaying Task Names and State (C++)</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Starting an Executable Weekly</h1>
<p>Writing a task that starts an executable on a weekly basis is done by defining a weekly trigger and an executable action.</p>
<h2>Weekly Triggers</h2>
<p>Weekly triggers use their start boundary to activate the trigger and to specify the time of day that the task is run. When the trigger is activated, the trigger also specifies when the task is run during the week and if the task runs every week, every other week, every third week, and so on.</p>
<h2>Weekly Trigger Examples</h2>
<p>The following examples show how to create tasks that start Notepad on a weekly basis.</p>

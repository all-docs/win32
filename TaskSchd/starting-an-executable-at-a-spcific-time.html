<h1>Starting an Executable at a Specific Time</h1>
<p>Writing a task that starts an executable at a specific time is done by defining a time trigger and an executable action.</p>
<h2>Start Boundary</h2>
<p>It is important to note that a time trigger is different from other time-based triggers in that it is fired when the trigger is activated by its start boundary. Other time-based triggers are activated by their start boundary, but they do not start performing their actions (in this case starting an executable) until a scheduled date is reached.</p>
<h2>Time Trigger Examples</h2>
<p>The following examples start Notepad 30 seconds after the task is activated:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="time-trigger-example--c---.html">Time Trigger Example (C++)</a></li>
<li><a href="time-trigger-example--scripting-.html">Time Trigger Example (Scripting)</a></li>
<li><a href="time-trigger-example--xml-.html">Time Trigger Example (XML)</a></li>
</ul>

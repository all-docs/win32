<h1>Idle Triggers for Task Scheduler 1.0</h1>
<p>An idle trigger is an event-based trigger that is fired a specific number of times after the computer becomes idle. There are multiple conditions that define when a computer becomes idle, such as when no keyboard or mouse input occurs.</p>
<p>Idle triggers are created by specifying TASK_EVENT_TRIGGER_ON_IDLE in the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mstask/ne-mstask-task_trigger_type"><strong>TASK_TRIGGER_TYPE</strong></a> member of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mstask/ns-mstask-task_trigger"><strong>TASK_TRIGGER</strong></a> structure. The idle trigger is fired when the system becomes idle for the amount of time that is specified by the idle wait time of the work item.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
When TASK_EVENT_TRIGGER_ON_IDLE is specified, the <strong>wStartHour</strong>, <strong>wStartMinute</strong>, and <strong>Type</strong> members of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mstask/ns-mstask-task_trigger"><strong>TASK_TRIGGER</strong></a> structure are ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>You can set the idle wait time of a work item by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mstask/nf-mstask-ischeduledworkitem-setidlewait"><strong>IScheduledWorkItem::SetIdleWait</strong></a> method. This method sets the amount of time (in minutes) that the system must remain idle before the trigger is fired and the work item is executed.</p>
<p>To retrieve the idle time of a task, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Mstask/nf-mstask-ischeduledworkitem-getidlewait"><strong>IScheduledWorkItem::GetIdleWait</strong></a> method.</p>

<h1>Interoperability With Other Windows Features</h1>
<p>The <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ms684146(v=vs.85)">Distributed Transaction Coordinator</a> (DTC) enables <em>distributed transactions</em>, or transactions that are under the control of multiple resource managers on one or more systems. KTM and DTC work closely together to accomplish this.</p>
<p>COM+ exposes a declarative model for transactional programming. In other words, the programmer declares the extent to which an object can take advantage of transactions, and the COM+ runtime manages the transactions on the object's behalf. For example, an object can be declared to participate in a transaction only if one already exists, to require a transaction (one is created if it does not already exist), to require a new transaction (one is created regardless of whether one already exists), or is not transactional. These declaratively-managed transactions are automatically used on database connections created by COM+ objects that are executing in the context of a transaction.</p>

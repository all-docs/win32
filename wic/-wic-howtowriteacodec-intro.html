<h1>Introduction (How to Write a WIC-Enabled Codec)</h1>
<p>The Windows Imaging Component (WIC) is an extensible platform for digital imaging on the WindowsÂ Vista and WindowsÂ 7 operating systems. WIC is also available on WindowsÂ XP and Windows ServerÂ 2003, either as part of Microsoft .NET FrameworkÂ 3.0 or as a separate component that you can redistribute. Any application using the WIC can access, display, process, and print images in any image format that provides a WIC-enabled codec, using a single set of consistent interfaces that eliminate the need for specialized knowledge of specific formats.</p>
<p>The WindowsÂ Vista Explorer, WindowsÂ Vista Photo Gallery, Live Photo Gallery, and WindowsÂ 7 Photo Viewer are built on WIC. After a WIC-enabled codec is installed on a WindowsÂ Vista or WindowsÂ 7 system, the operating system provides the same level of support for the associated image format as for the standard image formats that ship with the platform. Because you write the codec for your own image format, you can ensure consistent quality wherever your image format is used, and you get the benefits of full platform support.</p>

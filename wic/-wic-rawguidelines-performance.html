<h1>Performance (Windows Imaging Component)</h1>
<p>The Microsoft goal is that the performance of RAW processing through the Windows Imaging Component (WIC) interface be equivalent to industry-leading RAW processing tools and applications. To provide performance guidance, a set of comprehensive tests comparing the performance of popular RAW workflow tools was performed. The tests included both Windows and Apple Macintosh operating system versions of RAW processing products, sample RAW files from current single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras, and a series of functions that represent common workflow steps.</p>
<p>Based on these results, Microsoft suggests the following recommendations to partners for RAW processing performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseline performance should be equal to or better than the processing times of current manufacturer-supplied RAW processing applications and tools.</li>
<li>Optimal performance targets should match or exceed the highest performing application without any sacrifice in quality (in these tests, Photoshop Camera RAW generally performed fastest).</li>
</ul>

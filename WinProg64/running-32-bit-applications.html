<h1>Running 32-bit Applications</h1>
<p>WOW64 is the x86 emulator that allows 32-bit Windows-based applications to run seamlessly on 64-bit Windows. This allows for 32-bit (x86) Windows applications to run seamlessly in 64-bit (x64) Windows, as well as for 32-bit (x86) and 32-bit (ARM) Windows applications to run seamlessly in 64-bit (ARM64) Windows. WOW64 is provided with the operating system and does not have to be explicitly enabled. For more information, see <a href="wow64-implementation-details.html">WOW64 Implementation Details</a>.</p>
<p>The system isolates 32-bit applications from 64-bit applications, which includes preventing file and registry collisions. Console, GUI, and service applications are supported. The system provides interoperability across the 32/64 boundary for scenarios such as cut and paste and COM. However, 32-bit processes cannot load 64-bit DLLs for execution, and 64-bit processes cannot load 32-bit DLLs for execution. This restriction does not apply to DLLs loaded as data files or image resource files; for more information, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibraryexa"><strong>LoadLibraryEx</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A 32-bit application can detect whether it is running under WOW64 by calling the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wow64apiset/nf-wow64apiset-iswow64process"><strong>IsWow64Process</strong></a> function (use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wow64apiset/nf-wow64apiset-iswow64process2"><strong>IsWow64Process2</strong></a> if targeting WindowsÂ 10). The application can obtain additional information about the processor by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getnativesysteminfo"><strong>GetNativeSystemInfo</strong></a> function.</p>
<p>Note that 64-bit Windows does not support running 16-bit Windows-based applications. The primary reason is that handles have 32 significant bits on 64-bit Windows. Therefore, handles cannot be truncated and passed to 16-bit applications without loss of data. Attempts to launch 16-bit applications fail with the following error: <strong>ERROR_BAD_EXE_FORMAT</strong>.</p>

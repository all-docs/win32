<h1>Interprocess Communication Between 32-bit and 64-bit Applications</h1>
<p>The following techniques can be used for communication between 32-bit and 64-bit applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>64-bit versions of Windows use 32-bit handles for interoperability. When sharing a handle between 32-bit and 64-bit applications, only the lower 32 bits are significant, so it is safe to truncate the handle (when passing it from 64-bit to 32-bit) or sign-extend the handle (when passing it from 32-bit to 64-bit). Handles that can be shared include handles to user objects such as windows (<strong>HWND</strong>), handles to GDI objects such as pens and brushes (<strong>HBRUSH</strong> and <strong>HPEN</strong>), and handles to named objects such as mutexes, semaphores, and file handles.</li>
<li>Remote procedure calls (RPC) can be used.</li>
<li>COM LocalServers can be used if both 32-bit and 64-bit proxy/stub DLLs are registered for all interfaces used.</li>
<li>Shared memory can be used if pointer-dependent types are converted properly (or avoided).</li>
<li>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessa"><strong>CreateProcess</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea"><strong>ShellExecute</strong></a> functions can launch 32-bit and 64-bit processes from either 32-bit or 64-bit processes with certain limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>A 64-bit executable file located under %windir%\System32 cannot be launched from a 32-bit process, because the file system redirector redirects the path. Do not disable redirection to accomplish this; use %windir%\Sysnative instead. For more information, see <a href="file-system-redirector.html">File System Redirector</a>.</p>

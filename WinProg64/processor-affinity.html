<h1>Processor Affinity Under WOW64</h1>
<p>32-bit Windows supports a maximum of 32 processors. Therefore, functions such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getprocessaffinitymask"><strong>GetProcessAffinityMask</strong></a> simulate a computer with 32 processors when called under WOW64.</p>
<p>The affinity mask is obtained by performing a bitwise OR operation of the top 32 bits of the mask with the low 32 bits. Therefore, if a thread has affinity for processors 0, 1, and 32, WOW64 reports the affinity as 0 and 1, because processor 32 maps to processor 0. Functions that set processor affinity, such as <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadaffinitymask"><strong>SetThreadAffinityMask</strong></a>, restrict processors to the first 32 processors under WOW64.</p>
<p>For more information about processor affinity, see <a href="/windows/desktop/ProcThread/multiple-processors">Multiple Processors</a>.</p>

<h1>Exception Handling under WOW64</h1>
<p>WOW64 uses native x64, ia64, or ARM64 exceptions as a transport for x86 exceptions. Therefore, in a 32-bit application running under WOW64, uncaught exceptions behave like native 64-bit exceptions.</p>
<p>In an application running on a 32-bit version of Windows, uncaught exceptions are passed on to higher-level exception handlers of the application, when available. In the same 32-bit application running under WOW64, the system may suppress uncaught exceptions.</p>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ Vista, Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP:</strong> In the same 32-bit application running under WOW64, the system calls the exception filters but may suppress uncaught exceptions without invoking the associated handlers. This behavior changed starting with WindowsÂ Vista with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1).</p>
<p>For more information about uncaught exceptions in window procedures, see the <a href="/windows/win32/api/winuser/nc-winuser-wndproc">WindowProc</a> function.</p>

<h1>Virtual Address Space (Programming Guide for 64-bit Windows)</h1>
<p>By default, 64-bit Microsoft Windows-based applications have a user-mode address space of several terabytes. For precise values, see <a href="/windows/desktop/Memory/memory-limits-for-windows-releases">Memory Limits for Windows and Windows Server Releases</a>. However, applications can specify that the system should allocate all memory for the application below 2 gigabytes. This feature is beneficial for 64-bit applications if the following conditions are true:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2 GB address space is sufficient.</li>
<li>The code has many pointer truncation warnings.</li>
<li>Pointers and integers are freely mixed.</li>
<li>The code has polymorphism using 32-bit data types.</li>
</ul>
<p>All pointers are still 64-bit pointers, but the system ensures that every memory allocation occurs below the 2 GB limit, so that if the application truncates a pointer, no significant data is lost. Pointers can be truncated to 32-bit values, then extended to 64-bit values by either sign extension or zero extension.</p>
<p>To specify this memory limitation, use the <strong>/LARGEADDRESSAWARE:NO</strong> linker option. Note that <strong>/LARGEADDRESSAWARE:NO</strong> is ignored for an ARM64 binary. However, be aware that problems can occur when using this option. If you build a DLL that uses this option and the DLL is called by an application that does not use this option, the DLL could truncate a 64-bit pointer whose upper 32 bits are significant. This can cause application failure without any warning.</p>

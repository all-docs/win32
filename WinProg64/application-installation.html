<h1>Application Installation on 64-bit Systems</h1>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/Msi/windows-installer-on-64-bit-operating-systems">64-bit Windows Installer</a> can seamlessly install 32-bit MSI-based applications on 64-bit Windows. For older applications that use a 16-bit stub to launch a 32-bit installation engine, 64-bit Windows recognizes specific 16-bit installer programs and substitutes a ported 32-bit version.</p>
<p>16-bit DOS, Windows, or OS/2 applications often use a 16-bit stub to check the machine type, then launch a 32-bit installation engine to actually perform the installation. To enable installation of applications that use this technique, 64-bit Windows substitutes 32-bit versions for the following 16-bit installer programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Setup for Windows 1.2</li>
<li>Microsoft Setup for Windows 2.6</li>
<li>Microsoft Setup for Windows 3.0</li>
<li>Microsoft Setup for Windows 3.01</li>
<li>InstallShield 5.x</li>
</ul>
<p>The list of substitutions is stored in the registry under the following key: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NtVdm64</strong>.</p>

<p>[!Note]<br />
This mechanism is provided only for compatibility with 32-bit applications that use the 16-bit Microsoft installer programs listed in this topic. Addition of third-party installer programs is not supported.</p>

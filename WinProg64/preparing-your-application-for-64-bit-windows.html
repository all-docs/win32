<h1>Preparing Your Application for 64-bit Windows</h1>
<p>There are several features that make it easier for you to develop applications that will run on both 32- and 64-bit Windows. Most of these, such as the new data types, are described in <a href="getting-ready-for-64-bit-windows.html">Getting Ready for 64-bit Windows</a>.</p>
<p>The 64-bit toolkit that ships with the Windows SDK includes a 64-bit MIDL compiler, Midl.exe, for generating native 64-bit stubs, as well as 32-bit stubs. Use the <strong>/env win64</strong> switch to generate 64-bit stubs only. The default is to generate dual stubs that run on both platforms.</p>
<p>Note that the 64-bit MIDL supports the <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/-oi"><strong>/Oicf</strong></a> and <a href="/windows/desktop/Midl/-os"><strong>/Os</strong></a> optimization modes only.</p>

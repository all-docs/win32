<h1>Registry Redirector</h1>
<p>The registry redirector isolates 32-bit and 64-bit applications by providing separate logical views of certain portions of the registry on WOW64. The registry redirector intercepts 32-bit and 64-bit registry calls to their respective logical registry views and maps them to the corresponding physical registry location. The redirection process is transparent to the application. Therefore, a 32-bit application can access registry data as if it were running on 32-bit Windows even if the data is stored in a different location on 64-bit Windows.</p>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ 10 on ARM:</strong> In addition to the 32-bit logical view for x86 applications, WindowsÂ 10 on ARM includes a separate logical view for 32-bit ARM applications.</p>
<p>A subset of keys under redirected registry paths are shared. 32-bit registry calls to shared keys are not redirected. Instead, one physical copy of the key is mapped into each logical view of the registry. For a list of redirected keys and shared keys, see <a href="shared-registry-keys.html">Registry Keys Affected by WOW64</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP:</strong> To enable application interoperability through COM and other mechanisms, a subset of redirected registry keys are also <em>reflected</em>. The process of registry reflection copies registry keys and values between two registry views to keep them synchronized. Registry reflection was removed starting with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see <a href="registry-reflection.html">Registry Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>The following scenario illustrates the use of these logical views:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 32-bit x86 application checks for the existence of the following registry key: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Hello</strong>. If the key does not exist, the application creates it with a default value of &quot;Hello 32-bit x86 world&quot;; otherwise, it reads and displays the value.</li>
<li>The same application is modified to write &quot;Hello 64-bit world&quot; instead of &quot;Hello 32-bit x86 world&quot; and recompiled as a 64-bit x64 or ARM64 application.</li>
<li><strong>WindowsÂ 10 on ARM:</strong> The same application is modified to write â€œHello 32-bit ARM worldâ€ and recompiled as a 32-bit ARM application.</li>
<li>When the 32-bit x86 application is run on 64-bit Windows, it displays &quot;Hello 32-bit x86 world&quot;. When the 64-bit application is run, it displays &quot;Hello 64-bit world&quot;. <strong>WindowsÂ 10 on ARM:</strong> When the 32-bit ARM application is run on 64-bit ARM64 Windows, it displays &quot;Hello 32-bit ARM world&quot;. All applications call the same registry functions with the same predefined handle and the same key name; the difference is that each application operates on its logical view of registry, and each view is mapped to a separate physical location of the registry, which keeps all versions of the string intact.</li>
</ul>
<p>Redirected keys are mapped to physical locations under <strong>Wow6432Node</strong>. For example, <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software</strong> is redirected to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node</strong>. However, the physical location of redirected keys should be considered reserved by the system. Applications should not access a key's physical location directly, because this location may change. For more information, see <a href="accessing-an-alternate-registry-view.html">Accessing an Alternate Registry View</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WindowsÂ 10 on ARM:</strong> Redirected 32-bit ARM keys are mapped to physical locations under WowAA32Node.</p>
<p>To help 32-bit applications that write <strong>REG_SZ</strong> or <strong>REG_EXPAND_SZ</strong> data containing %ProgramFiles% or %commonprogramfiles% to the registry, WOW64 intercepts these write operations and replaces them with &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%&quot; and &quot;%commonprogramfiles(x86)%&quot;. For example, if the Program Files directory is on the C drive, then &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%&quot; expands to &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)&quot;. The replacement occurs only if the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul>
<li>The string must begin with %ProgramFiles% or %commonprogramfiles%. If the string begins with a space or any character other than %, it is not replaced.</li>
<li>The case of %ProgramFiles% or %commonprogramfiles% must be exactly as shown because the string comparison is case-sensitive. For example, if the string begins with %CommonProgramFiles% instead of %commonprogramfiles%, it is not replaced.</li>
<li>The string cannot exceed MAX_PATH*2+15 characters. If it exceeds this length, it is not replaced.</li>
<li>The key cannot be opened with KEY_WOW64_64KEY. This flag specifies that operations on the key should be performed on the 64-bit registry view, so it is not replaced. For more information, see <a href="accessing-an-alternate-registry-view.html">Accessing an Alternate Registry View</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2008, WindowsÂ Vista, Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP:</strong> The KEY_WOW_64_64KEY flag does not affect whether a key is replaced. This flag affects replacement starting with WindowsÂ 7 and Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2.</p>
<p>In addition, REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ keys containing system32 are replaced with syswow64. The string must begin with the path pointing to or under %windir%\system32. The string comparison is not case-sensitive. Environment variables are expanded before matching the path, so all of the following paths are replaced: %windir%\system32, %SystemRoot%\system32, and C:\windows\system32. This patch is applied only to the keys that were reflected prior to WindowsÂ 7.</p>

<h1>Alignment Faults</h1>
<p>The system alignment-fault handler is turned off by default on Itanium-based systems. Therefore, any unaligned data access generates an exception that will not automatically be fixed by the system unless the application catches the exception in a <a href="/windows/desktop/Debug/frame-based-exception-handling">frame-based exception handler</a>. To enable the system alignment-fault hander, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-seterrormode"><strong>SetErrorMode</strong></a> function with <strong>SEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT</strong>. However, note that processes may experience severe performance degradation if the system alignment-fault handler is enabled and the process generates alignment faults.</p>
<p>If the WinDbg debugger has been installed as the system debugger, WinDbg will automatically be launched if any process on the system generates an unhandled exception. If you do not have a debugger installed as your system debugger, the system displays a dialog box stating that your application has encountered an error and providing the opportunity to report the problem to Microsoft.</p>
<p>On x64 and ARM64 systems, any alignment faults are handled by a combination of hardware and software. For best performance, all access to memory should be properly aligned. In addition, unaligned <a href="/windows/desktop/Sync/interlocked-variable-access">interlocked variable access</a> should be avoided on ARM64, as these operations are not atomic-safe.</p>

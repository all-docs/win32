<h1>Avoiding Polymorphism</h1>
<p>The new data types include two polymorphic types, <strong>INT_PTR</strong> and <strong>LONG_PTR</strong>. On 32-bit Windows, the <strong>INT_PTR</strong> maps to <strong>int</strong> and the <strong>LONG_PTR</strong> maps to <strong>long</strong>. On 64-bit Windows, both types map to the <strong>__int64</strong> intrinsic type. The MIDL compiler supports these types for remote procedure calls, but there is an inherent limitation that you must keep in mind when using them in a distributed environment. Be sure to comment your code accordingly.</p>
<p>Regardless of the platform size, the wire size of these polymorphic types is always 32 bits. When unmarshaling on 64-bit Windows, the run-time library sign extends signed values and assigns zero to the high-order bytes for an unsigned value. When putting a 64-bit value on the wire, the run time truncates the high-order bytes. Thus, only the low-order 32-bit values are usable.</p>
<p>Use the polymorphic types only when necessary for porting. For new interfaces, use the MIDL intrinsic integer types <strong>__int32</strong> and <strong>__int64</strong>, or use a pointer type or context handle, whichever is most appropriate for the kind of data being transferred.</p>
<p>The 64-bit compiler supports a new polymorphic intrinsic <strong>__int3264</strong>. Again, this type was developed to support porting efforts, in this case to support the <strong>UINT_PTR</strong> types transparently. (Another intrinsic, <strong>__long3264</strong>, will support the <strong>ULONG_PTR</strong> type.) Do not use <strong>__int3264</strong> directly; use the <strong>INT_PTR</strong> type when you need a polymorphic type for porting reasons.</p>

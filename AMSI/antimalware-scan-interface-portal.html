<h1>Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) is a versatile interface standard that allows your applications and services to integrate with any antimalware product that's present on a machine. AMSI provides enhanced malware protection for your end-users and their data, applications, and workloads.</p>
<p>AMSI is agnostic of antimalware vendor; it's designed to allow for the most common malware scanning and protection techniques provided by today's antimalware products that can be integrated into applications. It supports a calling structure allowing for file and memory or stream scanning, content source URL/IP reputation checks, and other techniques.</p>
<p>AMSI also supports the notion of a session so that antimalware vendors can correlate different scan requests. For instance, the different fragments of a malicious payload can be associated to reach a more informed decision, which would be much harder to reach just by looking at those fragments in isolation.</p>
<h2>Windows components that integrate with AMSI</h2>
<p>The AMSI feature is integrated into these components of Windows 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>User Account Control, or UAC (elevation of EXE, COM, MSI, or ActiveX installation)</li>
<li>PowerShell (scripts, interactive use, and dynamic code evaluation)</li>
<li>Windows Script Host (wscript.exe and cscript.exe)</li>
<li>JavaScript and VBScript</li>
<li>Office VBA macros</li>
</ul>
<h2>Developer audience, and sample code</h2>
<p>The Antimalware Scan Interface is designed for use by two groups of developers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Application developers who want to make requests to antimalware products from within their apps.</li>
<li>Third-party creators of antimalware products who want their products to offer the best features to applications.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
Starting in Windows 10, version 1903, if your AMSI provider DLL is not Authenticode-signed, then it may not be loaded (depending on how the host machine is configured). For full details, see <a href="/windows/desktop/api/amsi/nn-amsi-iantimalwareprovider"><strong>IAntimalwareProvider</strong> interface</a>.</p>

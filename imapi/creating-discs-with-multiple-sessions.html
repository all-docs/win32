<h1>Creating Discs with Multiple Sessions</h1>
<p>IMAPI is capable of creating multi-session data discs. There are a few considerations to be aware of when creating a multi-session disc.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-setactivediscrecorder"><strong>IDiscMaster::SetActiveDiscRecorder</strong></a> method determines whether there is an IMAPI multi-session disc in the active drive upon setting. If so, IMAPI goes into multi-session mode automatically. Using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-clearformatcontent"><strong>ClearFormatContent</strong></a> after multi-session mode has been established causes IMAPI to return to single-session mode. This means that a blank disc is required for a <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-recorddisc"><strong>RecordDisc</strong></a> burn. If the disc is in multi-session mode, the same disc must be in the active recorder or an error code of IMAPI_E_WRONGDISC will be returned.</p>
<p>Selecting a recorder while in Joliet format causes IMAPI to read information from the currently installed disc. If the disc is a previous IMAPI Joliet disc that has space for another session, IMAPI automatically sets itself to multi-session mode. This disc must be present in the active recorder when calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Imapi/nf-imapi-idiscmaster-recorddisc"><strong>RecordDisc</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Closing the first session on a disc requires 21 MB. Each additional session requires 11 MB to close.</p>

<h2>Profile Consumption Functions</h2>
<p>The profile consumption APIs are those APIs in ICM2 that take ICC or WCS XML profiles, profile handles, or rendering intents as parameters, and a set of new APIs for WCS profile support for application color management code.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Profiles and Profile Management Functions</h2>
<p>The profile management workflow is based on existing ICM2 APIs that are augmented to provide additional functionality for revising application code.</p>
<p>Profiles contain information used by color processing algorithms to translate color between different color spaces. Profile management provides a way to query and specify which profiles get used at different stages by the color processing model to manage color output of various peripheral devices with diverse color characteristics.</p>
<p>Profile management provides the following set of functionalities:</p>
<p>Â </p>
<ol>
<li>Installing color profiles for use in the system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Associating one or more installed color profiles with any particular device.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Choosing a default color profile of a particular type among the profiles available for use in a particular stage of color processing. This could be for a device among the profiles associated with it, or among the profiles installed in the system and not device specific.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Enumerating color profiles that satisfy particular criteria among the profiles installed in the system.</li>
</ol>
<p>The WCS profile filename extensions are &quot;.cdmp&quot; for DMPs, &quot;.camp&quot; for CAMPs, and &quot;.gmmp&quot; for GMMPs.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><strong>Per-user profile management and enabling execution in LUA context</strong></p>
<p>The goal of the design described in the current document is as follows:</p>
<p>Â </p>
<ol>
<li>Legacy ICM2 implementation does not provide support for per-user profile management. Different users cannot have their own profile settings. In Vista, the WCS profile management infrastructure enables users to configure individual profile settings for most functionalities.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>All legacy ICM2 profile management APIs modify settings system-wide and require administrative privileges. In Windows Vista, all users run in Least-privileged User Account (LUA) settings most of the time, and administrators can elevate privilege selectively to run applications that modify system-wide settings. In WCS profile management, all per-user profile settings are configurable in LUA context. Profile management applications can run as LUA settings, increasing their scope of use and ensuring that security of the system is not compromised.</li>
</ol>
<p>Profile management in Vista provides the following enhancements over legacy ICM2 infrastructure:</p>
<p>Â </p>
<ol>
<li>It enables profile association with devices, default profile settings, and enumeration of profiles in both per-user and system-wide scope.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Installing a profile remains system wide and requires administrator privileges. This is consistent with profile installation during device installation because device installation is system wide and requires administrative privileges.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Whether devices can be installed from LUA context is particular to what is supported for that class of device. For example, in Vista, it is possible to do printer installation from LUA context if the user has been granted rights to copy files into the driver store by a domain administrator using driver store policies. Color profile management infrastructure doesn't need to do anything special in this regard since the installation happens in spooler context.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Modifying profile settings in per-user scope can be done in LUA context; system-wide modifications required administrative privileges. Profile management operations that require reading configuration information can be done in LUA context for both per-user and system-wide settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Profile management scope indicates the scope of the operations performed; either per-user or system wide.</p>
<p>For each operation, it is indicated whether it can be done from LUA context. If an operation cannot be performed in LUA context, the corresponding profile management API returns failure with access denied. Applications using the API, such as Color Management Control Panel, can enable the user to elevate to administrative context (using OTS or Consent UI), and then call the API from the elevated context so that the operation will succeed.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The architecture is designed according to the requirements of the operations as mentioned in the enumerations and tables above.</p>
<h3>Profile management public API layer</h3>
<p>Because profile management scope is not supported by legacy ICM2 APIs, a new set of WCS profile management APIs is required that defines profile management scope as system wide or current user. ? Legacy ICM2 APIs continue to be supported for backward compatibility, and work on profile management scope that is implicit for the call. o ICM2 APIs that work on current-user scope ? This is for operations that are supported for both system wide and current-user scope in WCS profile management. Legacy ICM2 APIs call on new WCS APIs with profile management scope as current user. This makes sense from user perspective because this enables per-user settings from legacy applications and also executing most of the operations in LUA context. o ICM2 APIs that work on system-wide scope ? This is for operations (install profiles and uninstall profiles) that support only system-wide scope. No new WCS profile management APIs are created and existing APIs can be modified.</p>
<p>The underlying implementations of the profile management operations work on the following configuration data entities to create the context for color processing algorithms to provide color management functionalities. They are either device specific or global (device independent) settings. o Device specific configuration data: ? List of profiles associated with a particular device. ? Default profile for different profile types associated with a device. ? Matching mode of profiles used for enumeration. o Global configuration data: ? List of profiles installed in the system. ? Global default profile for different profile types. ? The underlying implementations of configuration data storage take in storage scope for configuration data (either device independent or device specific), which can be either system wide or current user. This is different from profile management scope. An operation with current-user profile management scope can cause a read from a system-wide storage scope if the current-user setting for that operation is not present. ? The ICM2/WCS API layer calls in this storage layer for getting and setting data with appropriate storage scope. The storage layer is transparent to profile management scope. The logic for combining data from current-user and system-wide storage scopes to create or update a configuration according to the profile management scope specified by the API caller. This logic is present in the ICM2/WCS API layer.</p>
<h3>Device-specific storage layer</h3>
<p>The storage for different classes of devices like print, capture or display could be different from each other. For example, configuration data for a print device must be stored using standard print APIs, such as SetPrinterDataEx and GetPrinterDataEx, to enable the profiles to be copied and settings to be transferred to a client machine during Point-and-Print connection. ? This layer exports functionality to open store, get data, set data and close store using common pre-defined interfaces so that the profile management configuration storage layer can call into them while being transparent to the way the data gets stored for that device.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates this architecture.</p>

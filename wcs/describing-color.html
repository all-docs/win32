<h1>Describing Color</h1>
<p>Color can be described in terms of components. The components most often used by imaging professionals are <em>hue</em>, <em>chroma</em>, and <em>lightness</em>. A hue is what is normally thought of as a color. A color's hue fixes its place in the visible spectrum of light. The chroma of a color is how &quot;pure&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; a color is. Neutral gray is said to have zero saturation. The lightness of a color refers to the intensity of light that is reflected or transmitted by an image.</p>
<p>The terms <em>tint</em>, <em>tone</em>, and <em>shade</em> are also well-used in color imaging literature. A tint of a color is obtained by mixing its hue with white. A tone of a color is created by mixing a hue with gray. A shade of a color is made by adding black to its hue.</p>

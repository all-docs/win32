<h1>HLS Color Spaces</h1>
<p>HLS <a href="c.html">color spaces</a> are also widely used by artists. Its color components are hue, lightness, and saturation (chroma).</p>
<p>Hue has the same meaning as the HSV model, except that a hue angle of 0 corresponds to blue in this model. Magenta is at 60, red is at 120. As with the HSV model, complementary colors are 180 apart.</p>
<p>Lightness is the amount of black or white in a color. Increasing lightness adds white to the hue. Decreasing lightness adds black to the hue.</p>
<p><a href="s.html">Saturation</a> in the HLS model is a measure of the &quot;purity&quot; of a hue. As saturation is decreased, the hue becomes more gray. A saturation value of zero results in a gray-scale value.</p>
<p>The following figure is a line drawing of HLS space, which is a double hexcone. Any horizontal cross section of the HLS color space is a hexagon. HLS is a normalized color space. That is, the lightness and saturation values range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive. Hue varies from 0 to 360 inclusive.</p>

<p>HLS color spaces can be device dependent or device independent.</p>

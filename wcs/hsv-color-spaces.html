<h1>HSV Color Spaces</h1>
<p>Hue, saturation, and value (HSV) <a href="c.html">color spaces</a> are often used by artists. &quot;Hue&quot; is what we normally think of as color. It is the attribute of a color by which we give it a name such as &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot;. &quot;Value&quot; is another word for &quot;lightness,&quot; the attribute of a color that makes it seem equivalent to some shade of gray between black and white. Saturation is a measure of how different a color appears from a gray of the same <a href="b.html">lightness</a>. Zero saturation indicates no hue, just gray scale. The HSV color space is normalized.</p>

<p>The preceding figure shows a line drawing of HSV space in the form of a hexcone. Each of its cross sections is a hexagon. At the vertices of each cross section are the colors red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta. A color in HSV space is specified by stating a hue angle, the chroma level, and the lightness level. A hue angle of zero is red. The hue angle increases in a counterclockwise direction. Complementary colors are 180 apart.</p>
<p>HSV color spaces can be device dependent or device independent.</p>

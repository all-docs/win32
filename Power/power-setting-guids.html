<h1>Power Setting GUIDs</h1>
<p>Power setting <strong>GUID</strong>s identify power change events. This topic lists power setting <strong>GUID</strong>s for notifications that are most useful to applications. An application should register for each power change event that might impact its behavior. Notification is sent each time a setting changes.</p>
<p>Power setting <strong>GUID</strong>s are defined in WinNT.h.</p>

<strong>GUID_GLOBAL_USER_PRESENCE</strong> (786E8A1D-B427-4344-9207-09E70BDCBEA9)</p>
<p>The user status associated with any session has changed. This represents the combined status of user presence across all local and remote sessions on the system.</p>
<p>This notification is sent only services and other programs running in session 0. User-mode applications should register for <strong>GUID_SESSION_USER_PRESENCE</strong> instead.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008:</strong> This notification is available starting with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data</strong> member is a <strong>DWORD</strong> with a value from the <strong><a href="/windows/win32/api/winnt/ne-winnt-user_activity_presence">USER_ACTIVITY_PRESENCE</a></strong> enumeration:</p>

<strong>GUID_IDLE_BACKGROUND_TASK</strong> (515C31D8-F734-163D-A0FD-11A08C91E8F1)</p>
<p>The system is busy. This indicates that the system will not be moving into an idle state in the near future and that the current time is a good time for components to perform background or idle tasks that would otherwise prevent the computer from entering an idle state.</p>
<p>There is no notification when the system is able to move into an idle state. The idle background task notification does not indicate whether a user is present at the computer.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data</strong> member has no information and can be ignored.</p>

<p>The <strong>Data</strong> member is a <strong>DWORD</strong> that indicates the current lid state:</p>
<p>0x0 - The lid is closed.</p>
<p>0x1 - The lid is opened.</p>

<strong>GUID_MONITOR_POWER_ON</strong> (02731015-4510-4526-99E6-E5A17EBD1AEA)</p>
<p>The primary system monitor has been powered on or off. This notification is useful for components that actively render content to the display device, such as media visualization. Applications should register for this notification and stop rendering graphics content when the monitor is off to reduce system power consumption.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data</strong> member is a <strong>DWORD</strong> that indicates the current monitor state:</p>
<p>0x0 - The monitor is off.</p>
<p>0x1 - The monitor is on.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012:</strong> New applications should use <strong>GUID_CONSOLE_DISPLAY_STATE</strong> instead of this notification.</p>

<strong>GUID_POWER_SAVING_STATUS</strong> (E00958C0-C213-4ACE-AC77-FECCED2EEEA5)</p>
<p>Battery saver has been turned off or on in response to changing power conditions. This notification is useful for components that participate in energy conservation. Applications should register for this notification and save power when battery saver is on.</p>
<p>The <strong>Data</strong> member is a <strong>DWORD</strong> that indicates battery saver state:</p>
<p>0x0 - Battery saver is off.</p>
<p>0x1 - Battery saver is on. Save energy where possible.</p>

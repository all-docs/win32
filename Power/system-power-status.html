<h1>System Power Status</h1>
<p>The system power status indicates whether the source of power for a computer is a system battery or AC power. For computers that use batteries, the system power status also indicates how much battery life remains and whether the battery is charging.</p>
<p>Power information is retrieved by registering for power setting notifications through the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinUser/nf-winuser-registerpowersettingnotification"><strong>RegisterPowerSettingNotification</strong></a> function. This function allows applications to register for specific power settings and be notified when they change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
To query for power status information without notifications, use <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Powerbase/nf-powerbase-callntpowerinformation"><strong>CallNtPowerInformation</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Applications and installable drivers typically use the system power status to determine whether continued operation is feasible. For example, before an application performs background operations such as compressing or paginating a file, it should check whether the system is on batteries. As another example, an application that is beginning a lengthy operation should check the status to determine whether enough battery power exists to complete the operation.</p>
<p>By default, the system does not query applications or drivers during sleep transitions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
If power is low, an application can request user intervention or request that the system suspend itself. You can suspend system operation by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/PowrProf/nf-powrprof-setsuspendstate"><strong>SetSuspendState</strong></a> function.</p>

<h1>Running with Special Privileges</h1>
<p>Some functions require special <a href="/windows/desktop/SecAuthZ/privileges">privileges</a> to run correctly. In some cases, the function can only be run by certain users or by members of certain groups. The most common requirement is that the user be a local administrator. Other functions require the user's account to have specific privileges enabled.</p>
<p>To reduce the possibility of unauthorized code being able to get control, the system should run with the least privilege necessary. Applications that need to call functions that require special privileges can leave the system open to attack by hackers. Such applications should be designed to run for short periods of time and should inform the user of the security implications involved.</p>

<h1>NLS Sorting Changes</h1>
<h2>Affected Platforms</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> - Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7<br />
<strong>Servers</strong> - Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<h2>Feature Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Severity</strong> - High<br />
<strong>Frequency</strong> - Low (few apps impacted, but if impacted, always broken)</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The National Language Support (NLS) functions help applications support the different language- and locale-specific needs of users around the world. New Windows versions almost invariably include NLS changes. This change affects collation and sorting, and therefore applications that have persistent indexes.</p>
<p>A collation table has two numbers that identify its version (revision): the defined version and the NLS version. Both versions are DWORD values, composed of a major version and a minor version. The first byte of a value is reserved, the next two bytes represent the major version, and the last byte represents the minor version. In hexadecimal terms, the pattern is 0xRRMMMMmm, where R equals Reserved, M equals major, and m equals minor. For example, a major version of 3 with a minor version of 4 is represented as 0x304.</p>
<p>For a major version, one or more code points change so that the application must re-index all data for comparisons to be valid. For a minor version, nothing moves, but code points are added. For this type of version, the application only has to re-index strings with previously unsortable values. In summary, here is what the version numbers mean in relation to the data changes in the locale-specific exception tables and default tables:</p>
<p><strong>NLSVersion Major</strong> â€“ Changed code points in the 'exception,' or locale-specific tables<br />
<strong>NLSVersion Minor</strong> â€“ Added new code points in the 'exception,' or locale-specific tables<br />
<strong>DefinedVersion Major</strong> â€“ Changed code points in the default table<br />
<strong>DefinedVersion Minor</strong> â€“ Added new code points in the default table</p>
<p><strong>Sorting version numbers for released versions:</strong></p>

<h2>Manifestation</h2>
<p>Applications (such as databases) with persistent indexes that do not check the NLS version and re-index upon version change will fail to sort correctly or may fail to provide requested results.</p>
<p>In the case of user interfaces, lists (for example, alphabetical, numeric, alphanumeric, symbols, and so on) may sort incorrectly.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Your application can call either <strong>GetNLSVersionEx</strong> (Windows Vista or later) or <strong>GetNLSVersion</strong> (prior to Windows Vista) to retrieve both the defined version and the NLS version for a collation table.</p>
<ul>
<li>GetNLSVersionEx:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Retrieves information about the current version of a specified NLS capability for a locale specified by name</em><br />
This function allows an application such as Active Directory to determine whether an NLS change affects the locale used for a particular index table. If it does not, there is no need to re-index the table. For more information, see Handling Locale and Language Information.<br />
This function supports custom locales. If <em>lpLocaleName</em> specifies a supplemental locale, the data retrieved is the correct data for the collation order associated with that supplemental locale.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista do not support <strong>GetNLSVersionEx</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>GetNLSVersion (use for applications running on versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista):</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Retrieves information about the current version of a specified NLS capability for a locale specified by identifier</em><br />
This function allows an application such as Active Directory to determine if an NLS change affects the locale identifier used for a particular index table. If it does not, there is no need to re-index the table. For more information, see Handling Locale and Language Information.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> This function retrieves information only about a locale specified by identifier. The <strong>GetNLSVersionEx</strong> function supports additional locales, features, and RFC 4646 names. However, versions of Windows prior to Windows Vista do not support <strong>GetNLSVersionEx</strong>.<br />
Applications meant to run only on Windows Vista and later should use <strong>GetNLSVersionEx</strong> in preference to this function. <strong>GetNLSVersionEx</strong> provides good support for supplemental locales.</p>
<h2>Compatibility Test</h2>
<p><strong>Steps to tell if a collation version changed (that is, you need to re-index):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use GetNLSVersionEx()</strong> to retrieve an <strong>NLSVERSIONINFOEX</strong> structure when doing the original indexing of your data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store the following properties with your index to identify the version:  <strong>NLSVERSIONINFOEX.dwNLSVersion</strong> and <strong>NLSVERSIONINFOEX.dwDefinedVersion</strong> â€“ These two properties together specify the version of the sorting table you are using.<br />
<strong>NLSVERSIONINFOEX.dwEffectiveId</strong> - This specifies the effective locale of your sort. A custom locale will point to an in-box locale's sort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the index use <strong>GetNlsVersionEx()</strong> to discover the version of your data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of the three properties has changed, the sorting data you are using could return different results and any indexing you have may fail to find records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you KNOW that your data does not contain invalid Unicode code points (that is, all of your strings returned <strong>TRUE</strong> from a call to <strong>IsNLSDefinedString()</strong>), then you may consider them the same if ONLY the low byte of <strong>dwNLSVersion</strong> and <strong>dwDefinedVersion</strong> changed (the minor versions described above).</p>
</li>
</ul>

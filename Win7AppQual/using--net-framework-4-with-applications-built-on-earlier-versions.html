<h1>Using .NET Framework 4 with Applications Built on Earlier Versions</h1>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> - Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7<br />
<strong>Servers</strong> - Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<h2>Feature Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Severity</strong> - Low<br />
<strong>Frequency</strong> - High</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The .NET Framework 4 is highly compatible with applications that are built by using earlier .NET Framework versions. The primary changes in .NET Framework 4 are to improve security, standards compliance, correctness, reliability, and performance.</p>
<p>However, .NET Framework 4 does not automatically use its version of the common language runtime (CLR) to run applications that are built by using earlier versions of the .NET Framework.</p>
<h2>Manifestation</h2>
<p>If you built an application by using an earlier .NET Framework and a user opens that application on a computer that has both .NET Framework 4 and the earlier version of the .NET Framework installed, the application uses the earlier CLR version.</p>
<p>However, if the .NET Framework 4 is the only runtime version that is installed on the computer, the application throws an exception and asks the user to install the runtime version that you built the application against.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To run applications that are built with earlier .NET Framework versions with .NET Framework 4, you must compile your application to target the .NET Framework 4 version by specifying it in the properties for your project in Microsoft Visual Studio, or you can specify .NET Framework 4 in the <a href="/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-1.1/w4atty68(v=vs.71)"><strong>&lt;supportedRuntime&gt; element</strong></a> in an application configuration file.</p>
<p>For more information about how to migrate to the .NET Framework 4, see <a href="/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ff657133(v=vs.100)">Migration Guide to the .NET Framework 4</a> and <a href="/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ff602939(v=vs.100)">Version Compatibility in the .NET Framework</a>.</p>
<h2>Compatibility Tests</h2>
<p>After you make the changes, test your application to make sure that it runs correctly. You can test compatibility as described in the <a href="/previous-versions/dd889541(v=msdn.10)">.NET Framework 4 Application Compatibility</a> topic.</p>
<p>If your application or component does not work after .NET Framework 4 is installed, submit a bug through the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/visualstudio">Microsoft Connect</a> website.</p>

<h1>User Agent String</h1>
<p>The <em>User Agent String</em> contains information about a browser's identity. The User Agent String is reported to the web server as an HTTP header every time that a browser makes a request to a web server. You can also access it through a client-side script. For example, you can display the User Agent String by typing the following URL into the Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8 address bar: &quot;javascript:alert(navigator.userAgent)&quot;. The following illustration shows the typical resulting dialog box from Internet ExplorerÂ 8 running on WindowsÂ 7.</p>

<p>Typically, the User Agent String is parsed specifically for the MSIE substring. Based on the reported version of the browser, the client-side or server-side programming logic takes a different action. For more information about the User Agent String, see <a href="/previous-versions/cc817582(v=msdn.10)">What Will Windows Internet Explorer Report as the User-Agent String?</a>.</p>

<h1>AppInit_DLLs in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2</h1>
<h2>Platform</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> - Windows 7<br />

<h2>Feature Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Severity</strong> - Low<br />
<strong>Frequency</strong> - Low</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>AppInit_DLLs is a mechanism that allows an arbitrary list of DLLs to be loaded into each user mode process on the system. Microsoft is modifying the AppInit DLLs facility in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 to add a new code-signing requirement. This will help improve the system reliability and performance, as well as improve visibility into the origin of software.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Values stored under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion \Windows key in the registry determine the behavior of the AppInit_DLLs infrastructure. The table below describes these registry values:</p>

<p>Â </p>
<p><strong>Windows 7</strong></p>
<p>All DLLs that are loaded by the AppInit_DLLs infrastructure should be code-signed. In the interests of application compatibility, the Windows 7 Operating System will load all AppInit DLLs. However, Microsoft recommends that all application developers code-sign their DLLs to help improve the reliability of Windows and prepare for code-signing enforcement in future versions of Windows. The RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs registry key controls this behavior and its value on Windows 7 is set to 0 by default.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Server 2008 R2</strong></p>
<p>All DLLs that are loaded by the AppInit_DLLs infrastructure must be code-signed. The RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs registry key controls this behavior and its value on Windows Server 2008 R2 is set to 1 by default.</p>

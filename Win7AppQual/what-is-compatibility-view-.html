<h1>What Is Compatibility View?</h1>
<p><em>Compatibility View</em> is a feature of Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8 that enables the browser to render a webpage nearly identically to the way that Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 7 would render it.</p>
<p>In Internet ExplorerÂ 8, Compatibility View changes how the browser interprets code that is written in CSS, HTML, and the Document Object Model (DOM) to try to match Internet ExplorerÂ 7. A site that a user views in Internet ExplorerÂ 8 Compatibility View is almost identical to a site that the user views in Internet ExplorerÂ 7. However, Compatibility View does not change how the browser interprets all code. For example, the changes in Internet ExplorerÂ 8 for how the browser handles ActiveX, the parser, AJAX, JavaScript, networking, and security might still cause compatibility issues. Compatibility View does not change these behaviors.</p>
<p>In an enterprise environment, some areas have lower risk for compatibility issues. For example, Intranet Zone websites use Compatibility View by default. Client web applications that render by using the Web Browser Control, or the WebOC (Internet Explorer rendering engine), also have a low risk for compatibility issues because Internet ExplorerÂ 8 defaults to a compatibility mode for the WebOC. However, the default configuration settings for Compatibility View might not ensure complete compatibility. To determine if a website or web application is compatible with Internet ExplorerÂ 8, you should test the website or web application.</p>

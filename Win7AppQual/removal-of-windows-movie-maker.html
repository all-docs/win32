<h1>Removal of Windows Movie Maker</h1>
<h2>Affected Platforms</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> - Windows 7<br />
<strong>Servers</strong> - Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<h2>Feature Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Severity</strong> - High<br />
<strong>Frequency</strong> - Medium</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Microsoft is deprecating and removing the Windows Movie Maker utility. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All entry points to Windows Movie Maker (for example, Start Menu, Start &gt; Run)</li>
<li>All binaries that were used by Windows Movie Maker (everything that was in %ProgramFiles%\Movie Maker)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a user's Movie Maker project files will remain on the system and be accessible to other applications that support this file format.</p>
<h2>Manifestation</h2>
<p>Remove of Windows Movie Maker results in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any attempt to launch Windows Movie Maker with its command line arguments will fail</li>
<li>Any plug-ins that were installed to enable new transforms and animations will remain installed but will not be exposed to the end user</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>To have such functionality in the future, a user will need to install a similar application from Microsoft or another software provider.</p>

<h1>Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) - Removal of Windows 2000 Client Support Service</h1>
<h2>Affected Platforms</h2>
<p><strong>Servers</strong> - Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<h2>Feature Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Severity</strong> - High<br />
<strong>Frequency</strong> - Low</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Windows 2000 Client Support Service is an optional component of the Message Queuing Server that you can install on a Windows 2003 or Windows 2008 domain controller machine. This service allows Windows 2000 clients to operate in a domain-integrated mode with any Message Queuing server installed on Windows 2003/2008 machines. MSMQ Clients operating on Windows XP upwards do not need this service.</p>
<h3>Manifestation of Impact</h3>
<p>This change impacts Windows 2000 when interoperating in a Windows 7 domain where all domain controllers are Windows Server 2008 R2. If a customer upgrades to the Windows 7 domain, the existing MSMQ applications on any Windows 2000 machines in the domain will not be able to operate in a domain-integrated mode unless these clients upgrade to a higher Windows version.</p>
<h3>Mitigation</h3>
<p>Users who have Windows 2000 Client machines on a Windows 7 domain can configure a Windows 2003/2008 domain controller in the domain and install the MSMQ Windows 2000 Client Support Service on this domain controller.</p>
<h3>Leveraging Feature Capabilities</h3>
<p>Users who have Windows 2000 Client machines running MSMQ should upgrade to a higher Windows version in order to take advantage of the Active Directory-based implementation of the MSMQ Server.</p>
<h3>Compatibility, Performance, Reliability, and Usability Testing</h3>
<p>Users who have Windows 2000 Client machines running MSMQ on a Windows 7 domain with one or more down-level domain controllers should verify that their applications are functional on this mixed domain.</p>

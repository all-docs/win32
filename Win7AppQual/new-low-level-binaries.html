<h1>New Low-Level Binaries</h1>
<h2>Affected Platforms</h2>
<p><strong>Clients</strong> - Windows 7<br />
<strong>Servers</strong> - Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<h2>Feature Impact</h2>
<p><strong>Severity</strong> - Medium<br />
<strong>Frequency</strong> - High</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>To improve internal engineering efficiencies and improve foundations for future work, we have relocated some functionality to new low-level binaries. This refactoring will make it possible for future installs of Windows to provide subsets of functionality to reduce surface area (disk and memory requirements, servicing, and attack surface).</p>
<h2>Manifestation of Impact</h2>
<p>As an example of functionality that we moved to low-level binaries, kernelbase.dll gets functionality from kernel32.dll and advapi32.dll. This means that the existing binary now forwards calls down to the new binary rather than handling them directly; the forwarding can be static (the export table shows the redirection), or runtime (the dll has a stub routine that calls down to the new binary). This will impact low-level applications such as security and backup applications that are dependent upon internal APIs and offsets.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>The only impact is to code that makes assumptions when attempting to look at the kernel32.dll or the advapi32.dll export table in memory, such as an anti-virus application might do. Use published APIs and not the details of their implementation. This is just one example of implementing around a detail of implementation for an API.</p>

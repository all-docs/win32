<h1>Internet Explorer Compatibility Test Tool (IECTT)</h1>
<p>The Internet Explorer Compatibility Test Tool (IECTT) is a component of the <a href="/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install">Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit</a>. This tool can help you diagnose issues in your web applications by displaying issues in real time and optionally uploading the results to an ACT database. The results include details about possible compatibility issues and links for more information about each compatibility issue. IECTT also enables you to exclude issues and modify available attributes.</p>
<h2>To open IECTT</h2>

<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, point to <strong>Programs</strong>, point to <strong>Microsoft Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.6</strong>, point to <strong>Developer and Tester Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Explorer Compatibility Test Tool</strong>.</li>

After you complete your testing, you can view your results in the <strong>Live Data</strong> screen of the IECTT.</p>
<h2>Upload Issues to Your ACT Database</h2>
<p>You can upload your web-based issues to the ACT database, which processes the information and enables you to view your results on the <strong>Analyze</strong> screen of the Application Compatibility Manager.</p>
<h2>Collect Your Compatibility Data</h2>

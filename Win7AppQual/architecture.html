<h1>Architecture (Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Application Quality Cookbook)</h1>
<p><em>Loosely-coupled Internet Explorer</em> (LCIE) improves the browserâ€™s reliability by separating its components and loosening their interdependence.</p>
<p>In particular, LCIE tries to isolate the Windows Internet Explorer frame and its tabs into separate processes. In Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8, this isolation improves performance and scalability. This architectural change might affect the compatibility of extensions and add-ons, including ActiveX Controls, Browser Helper Objects (BHOs), and UI toolbar components that are built by using older programming techniques.</p>

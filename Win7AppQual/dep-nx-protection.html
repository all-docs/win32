<h1>DEP/NX Protection</h1>
<p>Starting with Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 7 on WindowsÂ Vista, the Internet control panel item includes an <strong>Enable memory protection</strong> option to help mitigate online attacks. This option is also referred to as <em>Data Execution Prevention</em> (DEP) or <em>No-Execute</em> (NX). When this option is enabled, it works with the processor to help prevent buffer overflow attacks by blocking code execution from memory that is marked as non-executable.</p>
<p>In Windows Internet ExplorerÂ 8 on the WindowsÂ Vista with Service PackÂ 1 (SP1) operating system or a later version, this option is enabled by default. DEP/NX does not protect against all memory-based vulnerabilities. But when it is combined with other technologies like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), it helps prevent common buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Windows Internet Explorer and the add-ons that it loads. No additional user interaction is required to provide this protection, and no new prompts are introduced.</p>

<h1>Security Providers</h1>
<p>The Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) provides support for mutual authentication and is exposed directly through the SSPI APIs and services layered on SSPI, including RPC.</p>
<p>Not all security packages available to SSPI support mutual authentication. To obtain mutual authentication, the application must request mutual authentication and a security package that supports it. For example, the code example in <a href="mutual-authentication-in-a-windows-sockets-service-with-an-scp.html">Mutual Authentication in a Windows Sockets Service with an SCP</a> uses the &quot;negotiate&quot; package in Secur32.dll, which is included with WindowsÂ 2000.</p>

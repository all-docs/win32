<h1>Dynamically Linked Auxiliary Classes</h1>
<p>A dynamically linked auxiliary class is a class that is attached to an individual object, rather than to an object class. Dynamic linking enables you to store additional attributes with an individual object without the forest-wide impact of extending the schema definition for an entire class. For example, an enterprise could use dynamic linking to attach a sales-specific auxiliary class to the user objects of its sales people, and other department-specific auxiliary classes to the user objects of employees in other departments.</p>
<p>Dynamic linking is not complex: add the name of the auxiliary class to the values of an object's <strong>objectClass</strong> attribute. If the auxiliary class has any mandatory attributes (<strong>mustHave</strong> or <strong>systemMustHave</strong>), you must set them at the same time. For more information and a code example, see <a href="adding-an-auxiliary-class-to-an-object-instance.html">Adding an Auxiliary Class to an Object Instance</a>.</p>
<p>To remove a dynamically linked auxiliary class, clear the values of all attributes from the auxiliary class, and then remove the name of the auxiliary class from the <strong>objectClass</strong> attribute of the object.</p>
<p>If you dynamically add an auxiliary class that is a subclass of another auxiliary class, both auxiliary classes are added to the target object. However, removing the child auxiliary class does not remove its parent; each class must be explicitly removed.</p>

<h1>Composing and registering SPNs for SCP-based Windows Sockets Service</h1>
<p>The following code example shows how to compose and register the SPNs for a service. Call this code from your service installer after calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/winsvc/nf-winsvc-createservicea"><strong>CreateService</strong></a> and creating the service's service connection point (SCP).</p>
<p>The following code example calls the <strong>SpnCompose</strong> and <strong>SpnRegister</strong> example functions that compose and register the SPN. For more information and the <strong>SpnCompose</strong> source code, see <a href="composing-the-spns-for-a-service-with-an-scp.html">Composing the SPNs for a Service with an SCP</a>. For more information and the <strong>SpnRegister</strong> source code, see <a href="registering-the-spns-for-a-service.html">Registering the SPNs for a Service</a>.</p>
<p>This example uses the service class name and the distinguished name of its SCP to create its service principal name. For more information and a code example that shows how the client binds to the service SCP to retrieve these name strings, see <a href="how-clients-find-and-use-a-service-connection-point.html">How Clients Find and Use a Service Connection Point</a>. Be aware that the code for composing an SPN varies depending on the type of service and the mechanisms used to publish the service.</p>
<p>The service registers its SPN by storing it in the <strong>servicePrincipalName</strong> attribute of the service's account object in the directory. If the service runs under the LocalSystem account instead of under a service account, it registers its SPN under the local computer account's object in the directory.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>TCHAR szDNofSCP[MAX_PATH]; // DN of SCP. Initialize by querying SCP.
TCHAR szServiceClass[]=TEXT(&quot;ADSockAuth&quot;);
LPCTSTR szServiceAccountDN;   // DN of a service logon account. 
 
DWORD dwStatus;
TCHAR **pspn = NULL;
ULONG ulSpn = 1;
 
// Compose the SPNs.
dwStatus = SpnCompose(
        &amp;pspn,              // Receives pointer to the SPN array.
        &amp;ulSpn,             // Receives number of SPNs returned.
        szDNofSCP,          // Input: DN of the SCP.
        szServiceClass);    // Input: the service class string.
 
// Register the SPNs
if (dwStatus == NO_ERROR) 
    dwStatus = SpnRegister(
       szServiceAccountDN,  // Logon account to register SPNs on
       pspn,                // Array of SPNs
       ulSpn,               // Number of SPNs in array
       DS_SPN_ADD_SPN_OP);  // Add SPNs to the account
 
// Free the array of SPNs returned by SpnCompose.
DsFreeSpnArray(ulSpn, pspn); 
</code></pre>
<p>You can use similar code to unregister your SPNs when your service is uninstalled. Specify the <strong>DS_SPN_DELETE_SPN_OP</strong> operation instead of <strong>DS_SPN_ADD_SPN_OP</strong>.</p>

<h1>Publishing with Service Connection Points</h1>
<p>The Active Directory Schema defines a <strong>serviceConnectionPoint</strong> (SCP) object class to make it easy for a service to publish service-specific data in the directory. Clients of the service use the data in an SCP to locate, connect to, and authenticate an instance of your service.</p>
<p>This section provides an overview of service connection points and code examples that show how a client/service application uses SCPs.</p>
<p>The code example follows these steps to implement service publication with SCPs.</p>
<p>For more information and a code example that performs these steps, see <a href="creating-a-service-connection-point.html">Creating a Service Connection Point</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To create SCPs in the directory at service installation</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bind to the computer object for the host computer on which the service instance is installed.</li>
<li>Create an SCP object as a child of the computer object, specifying the initial values for the attributes of the SCP.</li>
<li>Set access control entries (ACEs) in the security descriptor of the SCP object to enable the service to modify SCP properties at run time.</li>
<li>Cache the <strong>objectGUID</strong> of the SCP in the registry on the service's host computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information and a code example that performs these steps, see <a href="updating-a-service-connection-point.html">Updating a Service Connection Point</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To update the SCP attributes at service startup</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Retrieve the <strong>objectGUID</strong> from the registry and use it to bind to the SCP.</li>
<li>Retrieve attributes, such as <strong>serviceDNSName</strong> and <strong>serviceBindingInformation</strong>, from the SCP. Compare these values to the current values and update the SCP if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information and a code example that performs these steps, see <a href="how-clients-find-and-use-a-service-connection-point.html">How Clients Find and Use a Service Connection Point</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To find and use an SCP by a client application</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bind to the Global Catalog and search for objects with a <strong>keywords</strong> attribute that matches the service's product GUID. Each object found is an instance of the service. Select an instance and retrieve the distinguished name of the SCP.</li>
<li>Use the distinguished name to bind to the SCP.</li>
<li>Retrieve the values of various attributes from the SCP, such as <strong>serviceDNSName</strong> and <strong>serviceBindingInformation</strong>. Use these values to connect to and authenticate the service instance.</li>
</ol>

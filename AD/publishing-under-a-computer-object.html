<h1>Publishing Under a Computer Object</h1>
<p>Typically, host-based services create SCPs under the computer object for the host computer. Host-based services are services closely tied to a single host computer.</p>
<p><strong>To create SCPs under a computer object</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/secext/nf-secext-getcomputerobjectnamea"><strong>GetComputerObjectName</strong></a> function to get the distinguished name (DN) in the directory of the computer object for the local computer.</li>
<li>Use that DN to bind to the computer object and create the SCP.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information and a code example, see <a href="how-clients-find-and-use-a-service-connection-point.html">How Clients Find and Use a Service Connection Point</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that only domain-member computers have valid computer objects in the directory.</p>
<p>To get the DNS or NetBIOS name of the local computer, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getcomputernameexa"><strong>GetComputerNameEx</strong></a> function.</p>

<h1>Enumerating Members in a Group</h1>
<p>The members of a group are stored in a multi-value attribute called <strong>member</strong>. For groups with a small to medium-sized membership, use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iadsgroup-members"><strong>IADsGroup.Members</strong></a> method to get a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nn-iads-iadsmembers"><strong>IADsMembers</strong></a> object that contains the list of all members. Then use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iadsmembers-get__newenum"><strong>IADsMembers::get__NewEnum</strong></a> to get an enumerator object that you can use to enumerate the members.</p>
<p>If the anticipated group membership will be 1000 or more members, use ranging to retrieve users one range at a time. For more information about using ranging to enumerate members, see <a href="enumerating-groups-that-contain-many-members.html">Enumerating Groups That Contain Many Members</a>.</p>

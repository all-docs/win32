<h1>Deciding Which Attributes to Retrieve for Each Object Found</h1>
<p>If you search for objects of a particular class, it seems logical that you retrieve attributes that actually exist on the objects of that class. Follow the same rules discussed in <a href="finding-a-list-of-attributes-to-query.html">Finding a List of Attributes To Query</a>. Be aware that constructed attributes can be retrieved in query, but constructed attributes cannot be used in filters.</p>

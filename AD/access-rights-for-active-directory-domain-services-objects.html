<h1>Access Rights for Active Directory Domain Services Objects</h1>
<p>All directory objects use the same set of predefined access rights that correspond to the common directory operations. These rights are described in the <a href="/windows/win32/api/iads/ne-iads-ads_rights_enum"><strong>ADS_RIGHTS_ENUM</strong></a> enumeration type.</p>
<p>In addition, you can define private access rights (control access rights) for operations that go beyond those covered by the predefined rights. See <a href="control-access-rights.html">Control Access Rights</a>.</p>

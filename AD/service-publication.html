<h1>Service Publication</h1>
<p>Services advertise themselves using objects stored in Active Directory Domain Services. This is known as <em>service publication</em>. Clients query the directory to locate services. This is called <em>client-service rendezvous</em>. This section discusses the types of directory objects used for service publication and explains how they are used for client-service rendezvous.</p>

<h1>Features of the Replication Model for Active Directory Domain Services</h1>
<p>The replication model used in Active Directory Domain Services is called <em>multi-master loose consistency with convergence</em>. In this model, the directory can have many replicas; a replication system propagates changes made at any given replica to all other replicas. The replicas are not guaranteed to be consistent with each other at any particular time (&quot;loose consistency&quot;), because changes can be applied to any replica at any time (&quot;multi-master&quot;). If the system is allowed to reach a steady state, in which no new updates are occurring and all previous updates have been completely replicated, all replicas are guaranteed to converge on the same set of values (&quot;convergence&quot;).</p>

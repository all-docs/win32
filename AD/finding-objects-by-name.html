<h1>Finding Objects by Name</h1>
<p>Most objects in Active Directory Domain Services use the <strong>cn</strong> property as their naming attribute. Some objects, however, use a naming attribute other than <strong>cn</strong>. For example, a domain controller uses the <strong>domainDNS</strong> property for the naming attribute and an organizational unit uses the <strong>organizationalUnit</strong> property for the naming attribute. To avoid having to use a different naming attribute for different object types, the <strong>name</strong> property, which contains the relative distinguished name of the object, should be used to search for objects by name.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The following code examples show different query strings that can be used to find objects by name.</p>
<p>The following query string finds all objects with a name that begins with &quot;Jeff&quot;.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>(name=Jeff*)
</code></pre>
<p>The following query string finds all computer objects with a name that begins with &quot;leased&quot; or &quot;corp&quot;.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>(&amp;(objectCategory=computer)(|(name=leased*)(name=corp*)))
</code></pre>
<p>The following query string finds all users and with a name that begins with &quot;Karen&quot; or &quot;Jeff&quot;.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>(&amp;(&amp;(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person))(|(name=Karen*)(name=Jeff*)))
</code></pre>

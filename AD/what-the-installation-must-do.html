<h1>What the Installation Must Do</h1>
<p>Applications that extend the schema, must apply updates as described in the following procedure.</p>
<p><strong>To apply updates when extending the schema</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add the new attributes.</li>
<li>Add the new classes.</li>
<li>Add the new attributes to classes.</li>
<li>Trigger a cache reload.</li>
</ol>
<p>New attributes referenced in Step 3 must be referred to by its OID because the new attribute name is not present in the schema cache at this point.</p>
<p>Step 4 is unnecessary if the extensions will not be used immediately; the extensions will appear in the schema cache in approximately 5 minutes, depending on system load. For more information about the schema cache and how to trigger a cache reload, see <a href="updating-the-schema-cache.html">Updating the Schema Cache</a>.</p>

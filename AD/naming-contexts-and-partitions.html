<h1>Naming Contexts and Directory Partitions</h1>
<p>Each domain controller in a domain forest controlled by Active Directory Domain Services includes <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms681901(v=vs.85)"><em>directory partitions</em></a>. Directory partitions are also known as <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms681918(v=vs.85)"><em>naming contexts</em></a>. A directory partition is a contiguous portion of the overall directory that has independent replication scope and scheduling data. By default, the Active Directory Domain Service for an enterprise contains the following partitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms681936(v=vs.85)"><em>Schema Partition</em></a>: The schema partition contains the <strong>classSchema</strong> and <strong>attributeSchema</strong> objects that define the types of objects that can exist in the forest. Every domain controller in the forest has a replica of the same schema partition.</li>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms681898(v=vs.85)"><em>Configuration Partition</em></a>: The configuration partition contains replication topology and other configuration data that must be replicated throughout the forest. Every domain controller in the forest has a replica of the same configuration partition.</li>
<li><a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/ms681901(v=vs.85)"><em>Domain Partition</em></a>: The domain partition contains the directory objects, such as users and computers, associated with the local domain. A domain can have multiple domain controllers and a forest can have multiple domains. Each domain controller stores a full replica of the domain partition for its local domain, but does not store replicas of the domain partitions for other domains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows Server 2003 introduces the <em>Application Directory Partition</em>, which provides the ability to control the scope of replication and allow the placement of replicas in a manner more suitable for dynamic data. For more information about application directory partitions, see <a href="about-application-directory-partitions.html">About Application Directory Partitions</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about how Active Directory Domain Services maintain consistency between the various replicas of a directory partition, see <a href="replication-and-data-integrity.html">Replication and Data Integrity</a>.</p>

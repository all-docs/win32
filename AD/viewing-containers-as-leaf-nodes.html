<h1>Viewing Containers as Leaf Nodes</h1>
<p>Any object in Active Directory Domain Services can be a container of other objects. This can clutter the user interface, so it is possible to declare that an object of a specific class be only be displayed as a leaf in the user interface. The <strong>treatAsLeaf</strong> attribute is a single-valued display specifier attribute that determines if objects of that class should be only be displayed as leaf objects. This attribute is a Boolean value that, if <strong>TRUE</strong>, indicates that objects of the class should only be displayed as leaf elements. If <strong>FALSE</strong>, indicates that objects of the class can be displayed as a container or a leaf. Like all display specifier attributes, the <strong>treatAsLeaf</strong> attribute is set on a per-locale basis, so this attribute can be localized as required. For example, the <strong>User-Display</strong> for the English locale (0409) display specifier has the <strong>treatAsLeaf</strong> attribute set to <strong>TRUE</strong> by default. This causes the user interface to display all <strong>User</strong> objects as leaf objects.</p>
<p><strong>To set the value of the treatAsLeaf attribute</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bind to the desired display attribute in the desired locale. For more information and a code example, see <a href="displayspecifiers-container.html">DisplaySpecifiers Container</a>.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iads-put"><strong>IADs::Put</strong></a> method to set the <strong>treatAsLeaf</strong> attribute to either <strong>TRUE</strong> or <strong>FALSE</strong>.</li>
<li>To commit changes to the directory, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iads-setinfo"><strong>IADs::SetInfo</strong></a> method.</li>

<h1>Service Connection Point Properties</h1>
<p>The attributes of the <strong>serviceConnectionPoint</strong> class are sufficient for most services. Active Directory Domain Services do not define how the attributes are used, so the clients of your service must be able to interpret and use the data in your service SCPs. Services that must publish additional data about themselves can extend the Active Directory schema by creating a subclass of the <strong>serviceConnectionPoint</strong> class, giving the subclass a distinct name. For more information about schema extensions, see <a href="extending-the-schema.html">Extending the Schema</a>.</p>
<p>The most important attributes of an SCP are <strong>keywords</strong>, <strong>serviceDNSName</strong>, <strong>serviceDNSNameType</strong>, <strong>serviceClassName</strong>, and <strong>serviceBindingInformation</strong>. Client applications search the directory for <strong>keywords</strong> values to locate your SCP. When your SCP is found, clients can read other attributes to retrieve service data.</p>

<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->keywords<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->keywords<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute can contain multiple string values that identify your service. This attribute is included in the Global Catalog, which means that clients in any domain of an enterprise forest can search the Global Catalog for keywords associated with your service. This attribute is also indexed, which improves query performance. The installer that creates the SCP sets the values of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->keywords<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute. Typically, these values are not modified by the active service.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The exact keywords you should include in your SCP depend on how clients search for your service. The best keywords to use are GUID strings because GUIDs are guaranteed to be unique in a forest. Use the GUID string format returned by the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->UuidToString<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> function in the RPC library. You can also include human-readable names, if clients may use them to search for your service. The keywords in an SCP should include GUID strings and/or names that identify the following data about your service:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your company or organization: for example, Fabrikam.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The product or service: for example, SQL Server. This enables client applications to find SCPs for services of that type.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The specific version of the product or service, such as 7.5.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For SCPs that publish a specific set of data or capabilities for a type of service, include a GUID string or name that identifies the specific instance. For example, a database service could publish an SCP for a specific database. In this case, the SCP would include a product GUID to identify the service and another GUID to identify the database.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSNameType<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>Client applications use the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSNameType<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attributes to determine the service's host computer. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSNameType<!-- raw HTML omitted --> value indicates the type of DNS name specified by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> usually &quot;A&quot; if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> contains a host name or &quot;SRV&quot; if <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> contains a SRV record name.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> value is typically the DNS name of the service's host computer. Your service installer can call the <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->GetComputerNameEx<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> function to get the DNS name of the local computer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> For services that have DNS SRV records, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceDNSName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> can be the name of the SRV record. A client application uses the DNS APIs to retrieve all the SRV records that match this name. The client then retrieves the DNS host name from one of the SRV records. This technique is useful for replicated services because SRV records also include data that enables the client to select the best replica.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceBindingInformation<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A multi-value property that contains string values that store data required to bind to a service. This property is indexed and is replicated to the Global Catalog.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The content of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceBindingInformation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is specific to the service that published the SCP; clients must interpret the binding data. In the most common case, the binding data consists of a port number on the service host computer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->serviceClassName<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>A single-value property that identifies the class of service represented by the SCP. This is a descriptive string specific to the service that published the SCP; for example, SqlServer. For services that support mutual authentication, clients can use this property, along with the DNS name of the service's host computer, to form a service principal name. For more information, see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mutual Authentication Using Kerberos<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

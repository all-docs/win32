<h1>Mutual Authentication Using Kerberos</h1>
<p>Mutual authentication is a security feature in which a client process must prove its identity to a service, and the service must prove its identity to the client, before any application traffic is transmitted over the client/service connection.</p>
<p>Active Directory Domain Services and Windows provide support for service principal names (SPN), which are a key component in the Kerberos mechanism by which a client authenticates a service. An SPN is a unique name that identifies an instance of a service and is associated with the logon account under which the service instance runs. The components of an SPN are such that a client can compose an SPN for a service without the service logon account. This enables the client to request the service to authenticate its account even though the client does not have the account name.</p>
<p>This section includes an overview of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutual authentication using Kerberos.</li>
<li>Composing a unique SPN.</li>
<li>How a service installer registers SPNs on the account object associated with a service instance.</li>
<li>How a client application uses a service instance's service connection point (SCP) object in Active Directory Domain Services to retrieve data from which to compose an SPN for the service.</li>
<li>How a client application uses a service SPN in conjunction with the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) to authenticate the service.</li>
<li>A code example for a Windows Sockets client/service application that uses an SCP and SSPI to perform mutual authentication.</li>
<li>A code example for an RPC client/service that performs mutual authentication using the RPC name service and RPC authentication.</li>
<li>How a Windows Sockets Registration and Resolution (RnR) service uses SPNs to perform mutual authentication.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section discusses using Active Directory Domain Service for mutual authentication, in particular, the purpose of service connection points and service principal names in mutual authentication. It is not a complete discussion of how to use SSPI for mutual authentication or the authentication and security support available for RPC and Windows Sockets applications.</p>

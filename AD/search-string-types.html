<h2>Initial Search Strings</h2>
<p>Initial-search strings match a given set of characters at the beginning of a string, followed by a wildcard. For example, the initial-search string <code>Act*</code> would match &quot;Active Directory&quot;.</p>
<h2>Medial-Search Strings</h2>
<p>Medial-search strings match a given set of characters in the middle of a string, preceded by and/or followed by a wildcard. The medial-search strings <code>*Dir*</code>, <code>*ive*Dir*</code>, and <code>*ve*Dir*tor*</code> would all match &quot;Active Directory&quot;.</p>
<h2>Final-search Strings</h2>

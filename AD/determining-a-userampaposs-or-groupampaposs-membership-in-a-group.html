<h1>Determining a User's or Group's Membership in a Group</h1>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iadsgroup-ismember"><strong>IADsGroup.IsMember</strong></a> method can be used to determine if an object is a member of a group. This method returns <strong>TRUE</strong> if the specified object is a direct member of the group, that is, the group's member property contains the specified object.</p>
<p>A group can contain other groups. The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/iads/nf-iads-iadsgroup-ismember"><strong>IADsGroup.IsMember</strong></a> method does not recursively verify the members of groups in its member property, groups within those groups, and so on. To recursively verify that an object is a member of a group, enumerate the groups in the member property, verify the members of those groups to see if the object is a member, and if those groups contain other groups, check their members, and so on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Since groups can be nested, group membership may have loops. Any script that enumerates over many groups should keep an internal list of groups to end recursion if a group has already been visited.</p>

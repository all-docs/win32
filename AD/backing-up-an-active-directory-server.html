<h1>Backing Up an Active Directory Server</h1>
<p>An Active Directory server backup requires you to back up the database and the transaction logs. This topic provides a walkthrough of how a backup application backs up the Active Directory directory service.</p>
<p>The caller of these backup functions must have the <strong>SE_BACKUP_NAME</strong> privilege. You can use the <a href="dssetauthidentity.html"><strong>DsSetAuthIdentity</strong></a> function to set the security context under which the directory backup/restore functions are called.</p>
<p><strong>To backup an Active Directory server, perform the following steps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Call the <a href="dsisntdsonline.html"><strong>DsIsNTDSOnline</strong></a> function to determine if Active Directory Domain Services are running.</li>
<li>If Active Directory Domain Services are running, call the <a href="dsbackupprepare.html"><strong>DsBackupPrepare</strong></a> function to initialize a backup context handle. If Active Directory Domain Services are not running, it cannot be backed up and the backup application must fail the backup operation.</li>
<li>Call the <a href="dsbackupgetdatabasenames.html"><strong>DsBackupGetDatabaseNames</strong></a> function to get a list of files to back up. To release the memory returned by this function, call the <a href="dsbackupfree.html"><strong>DsBackupFree</strong></a> function.</li>
<li>For each name in the returned list of files, call the <a href="dsbackupopenfile.html"><strong>DsBackupOpenFile</strong></a> function followed by repeated calls to the <a href="dsbackupread.html"><strong>DsBackupRead</strong></a> function until the entire file has been read. When you have finished reading the file, call the <a href="dsbackupclose.html"><strong>DsBackupClose</strong></a> function to close it.</li>
<li>After all database files are backed up, call the <a href="dsbackupgetbackuplogs.html"><strong>DsBackupGetBackupLogs</strong></a> function to get a list of transaction logs. This list is handled just like the list of database files.</li>
<li>When you have finished backing up the transaction log, call the <a href="dsbackuptruncatelogs.html"><strong>DsBackupTruncateLogs</strong></a> function to delete all committed transaction logs that were backed up.</li>
<li>Save the contents of the expiry token provided by the <a href="dsbackupprepare.html"><strong>DsBackupPrepare</strong></a> function. This can be saved in a file or some other persistent memory. This token must be passed to the <a href="dsrestoreprepare.html"><strong>DsRestorePrepare</strong></a> function to initiate a restore operation.</li>
<li>Free the memory for the expiry token by passing the token pointer to the <a href="dsbackupfree.html"><strong>DsBackupFree</strong></a> function.</li>
<li>Finally, call the <a href="dsbackupend.html"><strong>DsBackupEnd</strong></a> function to release all resources associated with the backup context handle.</li>
</ol>

description: As discussed in the topic Inheritance and Delegation of Administration, ACEs can be set on a container object, such as an organizationalUnit, domainDNS, container, and so on, and propagated to child objects based on the ACE flags set on those ACEs.

<h1>Protecting Objects from the Effects of Inherited Rights</h1>
<p>As discussed in the topic <a href="inheritance-and-delegation-of-administration.html">Inheritance and Delegation of Administration</a>, ACEs can be set on a container object, such as an <strong>organizationalUnit</strong>, <strong>domainDNS</strong>, <strong>container</strong>, and so on, and propagated to child objects based on the ACE flags set on those ACEs.</p>
<p>If you have a secure object or an object whose ACEs you want to explicitly control, such as a private OU or a special user, you can prevent ACEs from being propagated to the object by its parent container or its parent container's predecessors.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="/windows/desktop/ADSI/iadssecuritydescriptor-property-methods"><strong>IADsSecurityDescriptor.Control</strong></a> property to control whether DACLs and SACLs are inherited by the object from its parent container.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/ADSI/iadssecuritydescriptor-property-methods"><strong>IADsSecurityDescriptor.Control</strong></a> property can be used to protect an object from the effects of inherited ACEs. The following flags force access control to be set explicitly on the object and prevent a user from modifying access control to the object by setting inheritable ACEs on the object's parent container, or its parent container's predecessors.</p>

<td><strong>SE_DACL_PROTECTED</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<p>Be aware that the <strong>SE_DACL_PRESENT</strong> flag must be present to set <strong>SE_DACL_PROTECTED</strong> and <strong>SE_SACL_PRESENT</strong> must be present to set <strong>SE_SACL_PROTECTED</strong>.</p>

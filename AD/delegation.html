<h1>Delegation</h1>
<p><em>Delegation</em> is one of the most important security features of Active Directory Domain Services. Delegation enables a higher administrative authority to grant specific administrative rights for containers and subtrees to individuals and groups. Domain administrators, with broad authority over large segments of users, are no longer required.</p>
<p>An ACE can grant specific administrative rights for the objects in a container to a user or group. Rights are granted for specific operations on specific object classes using ACEs in the container's ACL. For example, to enable a user named &quot;user 1&quot; to be an administrator of the &quot;Corporate Accounting&quot; organizational unit, add ACEs to the ACL on &quot;Corporate Accounting&quot; as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;user 1&quot;;Grant ;Create, Modify, Delete;Object-Class User&quot;user 1&quot;;Grant ;Create, Modify, Delete;Object-Class Group&quot;user 1&quot;;Grant ;Write;Object-Class User; Attribute Password&quot;</p>
<p>Now, user 1 can create new users and groups in Corporate Accounting and set the passwords on existing users, but user 1 cannot create any other object classes and cannot affect users in any other containers, unless, of course, user 1 is granted that access by ACEs on the other containers.</p>

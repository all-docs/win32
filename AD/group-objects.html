<h1>Group Objects</h1>
<p>A group is represented as a <a href="/windows/desktop/ADSchema/c-group"><strong>group</strong></a> object in Active Directory Domain Services. The following table lists important attributes of the <strong>group</strong> object.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Attribute</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->cn<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (or Common-Name) is a single-value attribute that is the object's relative distinguished name. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is the name of the group in Active Directory Domain Services. As with all other objects, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->cn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of a group must be unique among the sibling objects in the container that contains the group.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->member<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->member<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute is a multi-value attribute that contains the list of distinguished names for the user, group, and contact objects that are members of the group. Each item in the list is a linked reference to the object that represents the member; therefore, the Active Directory server automatically updates the distinguished names in the member property when a member object is moved or renamed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->groupType<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->groupType<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute is a single-value attribute that is an integer that specifies the group type and scope using the following bit flags:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ADS_GROUP_TYPE_DOMAIN_LOCAL_GROUP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ADS_GROUP_TYPE_GLOBAL_GROUP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ADS_GROUP_TYPE_UNIVERSAL_GROUP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ADS_GROUP_TYPE_SECURITY_ENABLED<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The first three flags specify the group scope. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ADS_GROUP_TYPE_SECURITY_ENABLED<!-- raw HTML omitted --> flag indicates the group type. If this flag is set, the group is a security group. If this flag is not set, the group is a distribution group. For more information, see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Group Types<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->memberOf<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->memberOf<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute is a multiple-value attribute that contains the list of distinguished names for groups that contain the group as a member. This attribute lists the groups beneath which the group is directly nested it does not contain the recursive list of nested predecessors. For example, if group D were nested in group C and group B and group B were nested in group A, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->memberOf<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute of group D would list group C and group B, but not group A.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectGUID<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectGUID<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute is a single-value attribute that is the unique identifier for the object. This attribute is a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). When an object is created in the directory, the Active Directory server generates a GUID and assigns it to the object's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectGUID<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute. The GUID is unique across the enterprise and anywhere else.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectGUID<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a 128-bit GUID structure stored as an OctetString.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectSid<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectSid<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute is a single-value attribute that specifies the security identifier (SID) of the group. The SID is a unique value used to identify the group as a security principal. It is a binary value that the system sets when the group is created.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Each group has a unique SID that the Windows NT/Windows 2000 Server domain issues that is stored in the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->objectSid<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute of the group object in the directory. Each time a user logs on, the system retrieves the SID for the groups of which the user is a member and places it in the user's access token. The system uses the SIDs in the user's access token to identify the user and his/her group memberships in all subsequent interactions with Windows NT/Windows 2000 security.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> When an SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot ever be used again to identify another user or group.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><!-- raw HTML omitted -->sAMAccountName<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
<td>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sAMAccountName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> attribute is a single-value attribute that is the logon name used to support clients and servers from a previous version (Windows 95, Windows 98, and LAN Manager). The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sAMAccountName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> should be less than 20 characters to support clients and servers from a previous version.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sAMAccountName<!-- raw HTML omitted --> must be unique among all security principal objects within a domain.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>

<h2>Group Types</h2>
<p>There are two types of groups defined by Active Directory Domain Services, <em>Security Groups</em> and <em>Distribution Groups</em>.</p>
<p>A security group provides a logical grouping of objects and the group itself can be used as a security principal in an Access Control List (ACL). When a security group is given access to an object, all members of the security group automatically receive the same access to the object. Security groups with Universal scope can also be used as an email entity. Sending an email message to a universal security group sends the message to all the members of the group.</p>
<p>A distribution group also provides a logical grouping of objects, but cannot provide any access privileges. Distribution groups are not security enabled and cannot be used as a security principal in an ACL. Distribution groups are only used for grouping purposes. For example, distribution lists can be used with email applications, such as Exchange, to send email to a collection of users.</p>
<p>For more information about group types in Active Directory Domain Services, see the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc781446(v=ws.10)">Group types</a> topic on <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/default.aspx">Microsoft TechNet</a>.</p>
<h2>Group Scope</h2>
<p>There are three group scopes that are defined by Active Directory Domain Services, <em>Universal</em>, <em>Global</em> and <em>Domain Local</em>. The scope of the group defines what types of object can belong to the group, what types of groups the group can be a member of and the scope of objects that security groups can be given access to. When the domain functional level is set to Windows 2000 mixed mode, security groups with universal scope cannot be created.</p>
<p>The following table lists the three group scopes and more information about each scope for a security group.</p>

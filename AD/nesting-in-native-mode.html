<h1>Nesting in Native Mode</h1>
<p>The following list describes what can be contained in a group that exists in a native-mode domain. This same list also applies to distribution groups in mixed-mode domains. The scope of the group determines these containment rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>A universal group can contain other universal groups, global groups and accounts from any domain within the forest in which this Universal Group resides.</li>
<li>A global group can contain other global groups and accounts from the same domain that the group belongs to. A global group cannot contain any universal groups, or any global group or account from another domain.</li>
<li>A domain local group can contain universal groups, global groups and accounts from any domain or forest. A domain local group can also contain other domain local groups from the same domain that the group belongs to. A domain local group cannot contain other domain local groups from any other domain or forest.</li>
</ul>

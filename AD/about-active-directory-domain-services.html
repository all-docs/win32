<h1>About Active Directory Domain Services</h1>
<h2>Writing Powerful Applications that Use Active Directory Domain Services</h2>
<p>This guide provides essential information for integrating Active Directory Domain Services in distributed applications designed for operating systems that support Active Directory Domain Services, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Server 2008</li>
<li>Windows Server 2008 R2</li>
<li>Windows Server 2012</li>
<li>Windows Server 2012 R2</li>
<li>Windows Server 2016</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fundamental Directory Features</h2>
<p>A directory service is a fundamental service for distributed applications. A directory service must provide the features listed in the following table.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Location transparency</td>
<td>Able to find user, group, networked service, or resource, data without the object address</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Object data</td>
<td>Able to store user, group, organization, and service data in a hierarchical tree</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rich query</td>
<td>Able to locate an object by querying for object properties</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High availability</td>
<td>Able to locate a replica of the directory at a location that is efficient for read/write operations</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Advanced Features of Active Directory Domain Services</h2>
<p>Active Directory Domain Services provides the features listed in the following table.</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Support for Internet standards</td>
<td>Active Directory Domain Services implements its features in accordance with published Internet standards such as LDAP and DNS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tightly integrated and flexible security</td>
<td>Advantages include:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Choice of authentication packages. Kerberos, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or a combination; for example, establish an SSL channel for encryption and then use Kerberos for authentication.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Central management of service and resource access by using the users and groups in Active Directory Domain Services.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Delegation of administration so that central administrators can delegate administrative tasks such as password changing or specific object creation and deletion.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Active Directory server uses the same access control mechanisms used on file systems in the Windows operating systems. Thus, the same tools that manage access control on a file system work for Active Directory Domain Services.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comprehensive Public Key infrastructure. The Microsoft Certificate Server and Smart Card support are integrated with Active Directory Domain Services to provide Smart Card logon and Certificate management.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Easily programmable</td>
<td>The Active Directory server can be programmatically accessed and administered using the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Active Directory Service Interfaces<!-- raw HTML omitted --> API, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lightweight Directory Access Protocol<!-- raw HTML omitted --> API, or the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->System.DirectoryServices<!-- raw HTML omitted --> namespace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Directory enabled system services</td>
<td>Your client application can be easily deployed to distributed desktops by creating a Windows Installer package and using the application deployment feature available in the Windows operating systems.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Key application integration</td>
<td>Key distributed applications, such as Exchange, are integrated with Active Directory Domain Services. Thus, companies can reduce the number of directory services to be managed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rich and extensible schema</td>
<td>The schema defines what objects and properties can be written and read from a directory service. The Active Directory Schema is rich. Most of the objects and properties a service requires are available. If not, a distributed application can extend the schema to support the application requirements.</td>

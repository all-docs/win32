<h1>Prerequisites for Installing a Schema Extension</h1>
<p>To modify the schema, ensure you have the following rights and are aware of the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have sufficient rights to modify the schema. The schema contains all of the data definitions for Active Directory Domain Services for the entire enterprise. To update the schema, a user must be a member of the Schema Administrators group, or have been delegated the rights to update the schema.</li>
<li>You can only make schema changes at the schema master. For more information, see <a href="detecting-the-schema-master.html">Detecting the Schema Master</a>.</li>
<li>The schema master must be writable; that is, the safety interlock in the registry must be removed. For more information, see <a href="enabling-schema-changes-at-the-schema-master.html">Enabling Schema Changes at the Schema Master</a>.</li>
</ul>

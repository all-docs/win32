<h1>Nesting a Group in Another Group</h1>
<p>Adding a group as a member of another group is called <em>nesting</em>. For distribution groups, nesting is supported in both mixed mode and native mode. For security groups, nesting is supported only for domains running in native mode.</p>
<p>To nest a group in another group, use the same techniques described in <a href="adding-members-to-groups-in-a-domain.html">Adding Members to Groups in a Domain</a>. Be aware that depending on the scope of the group, the group can contain only specific types and scopes of other groups.</p>
<p>The nesting options also depend on whether the domain is in mixed mode or native mode. For more information about groups in different domain modes, see <a href="nesting-in-native-mode.html">Nesting in Native Mode</a> and <a href="nesting-in-mixed-mode.html">Nesting in Mixed Mode</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about nesting of groups, see <a href="common-errors.html">Common Errors</a>.</p>

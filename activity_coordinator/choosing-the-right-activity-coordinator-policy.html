<h1>Choose the right Activity Coordinator policy</h1>
<p>Activity Coordinator provides several template policies, which should be selected based on the resources required by your task.</p>
<h2>Understand your activity workload</h2>
<p>Determine the Activity Coordinator Resources your task requires, and at which conditions your task should run. Profiling the task using a performance trace is a good place to start off.</p>
<h2>Choosing Resources</h2>
<p>Choose resources derived from the performance trace. These resources should be the ones that your activity workload will have an impact on. Do not forget resources you implicitly consume or affect, such as user-idle and power.</p>
<h2>Choosing Conditions</h2>
<p>Choose conditions based on the resource consumption of your workload, as observed in the performance trace. In general, we recommend using the best conditions for needed resources, and, if necessary, updating your policy with lesser conditions if it does not meet your needs within your desired timeframe. Starting with the best conditions and transitioning to lesser conditions is preferred before executing when your policy is not satisfied (its resource conditions arenâ€™t satisfied) to meet any deadlines. This gives the API a chance to minimize the user and system impact of your activity while increasing the opportunities for your activity to run.</p>
<p>For workloads with negligible or low resource consumption, conditions like <strong>ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_CONDITION_MEDIUM</strong> may be usable without adversely affecting the system. Workloads with higher consumption are better suited to use conditions when usage is least likely to impact the user experience, like <strong>ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_CONDITION_GOOD</strong>. Such workloads are more likely to cause significant impact when using lesser conditions, and these impacts may not be transient in nature. For example, consuming internet under a medium network condition could result in financial cost to the user if that network is metered and billed.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the types of devices and configurations your application supports in addition to the capabilities of the machine from any performance traces. Variability in the target environment may mean differences in how your workload impacts the user, the system, and the likelihood of your policy being satisfied over a given period.</p>
<h2>Deadline</h2>
<p>There may be various time constraints associated with your activity. Longer running work or work that needs to begin or be completed in a relatively short amount of time may be better served using lesser conditions to increase the likelihood of the policy opening. Shorter running work or work that has loose time requirements may have their needs met using the best conditions. Over longer timeframes, the target system is likely to have periods of low resource consumption. If a deadline is approaching, we recommend downgrading your policy if sufficient progress hasnâ€™t been made before resorting to regular execution methods after or on approach of the deadline. Reoccurring work can then switch to the original policy upon completion.</p>
<h2>Template policies</h2>
<p>The API comes with a set of template policies for the typical work profile that can be used to trivially get started with the API. For most programs that do local computing, we recommend using the template policies.</p>
<h2>Policy recommendation</h2>
<p>Of the provided template policies, if you arenâ€™t sure about which one you should pick, the <strong>ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_POLICY_TEMPLATE_GOOD</strong> should fit the bill for most cases. This policy will minimize user impact while providing a reasonable likelihood for the policy to be sufficiently open to complete the developerâ€™s work.</p>
<h2>Customize template policies</h2>
<p>Template policies may omit some resources (for example, GPU) which may not be required in general use cases. Based on the anticipated workload, a policy can be customized using the template policies as a starting point.</p>
<h2>Build policies from scratch</h2>
<p>Developers who require full control can start from an empty policy: <strong>ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_POLICY_TEMPLATE_EMPTY</strong>. However, for these scenarios itâ€™s recommended that you start with <strong>ACTIVITY_COORDINATOR_POLICY_TEMPLATE_BASE</strong>, which specifies the minimum recommended resources and conditions that apply to most situations. This helps ensure that important resource conditions aren't mistakenly omitted when configuring a policy from scratch, such as user-idle, CPU, and power resources.</p>

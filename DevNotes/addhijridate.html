<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Specifies adjustments to the date within the Hijri calendar.</p>
<p>The Hijri calendar is a lunar calendar used in the Islamic world. The months begin and end according to a decree that is based on the observation of the new moon. It is difficult to accurately predict the beginnings and endings of the months, and there are regional variations, so an adjustment of between zero and two days is made to the calendar.</p>
<p>The <strong>AddHijriDate</strong> registry value stores this adjustment value as follows.</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AddHijriDate-2</td>
<td>Subtract two days.</td>

<tr>
<td>AddHijriDate</td>
<td>Subtract one day.</td>

<td>No adjustment is necessary. (If the date has not been adjusted, this entry does not appear in the registry. If the date has been adjusted and then restored to its original value, this entry appears in the registry with no value.)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AddHijriDate+1</td>
<td>Add one day.</td>
</tr>

<h1>About Resource Enumeration</h1>
<p>Resource enumeration provides a close and precise view of instrumentation activity that takes place when an application is running. The instrumentation information can be abstracted and categorized as a set of process-specific items as part of the debugging process.</p>
<p>Tools, such as debuggers, often require access to instrumentation information but may find it is unavailable. To solve this problem, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Avrfsdk/nf-avrfsdk-verifierenumerateresource"><strong>VerifierEnumerateResource</strong></a> function extracts this type of information from applications to provide better context information for the problem being debugged.</p>

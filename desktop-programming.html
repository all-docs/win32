<h1>Get started with desktop Windows apps that use the Win32 API</h1>
<p>The Win32 API is the name given to the original platform for native C/C++ Windows applications that require direct access to Windows and hardware. It provides a first-class development experience without depending on a managed runtime environment such as .NET. That makes the Win32 API a great choice for applications that need the highest level of performance, and direct access to system hardware. You can use the Win32 API on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
This documentation covers how to create desktop Windows apps with the Win32 API. The Win32 API is one of several app platforms you can use to build desktop Windows apps. For more info about other app platforms, see <a href="/windows/apps/desktop/choose-your-platform">Choose your platform</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Get set up</h2>
<p>Follow these instructions, and start creating desktop apps for Windows that use the Win32 API.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download or update Visual Studio. If you don't already have Visual Studio, then you can install the free Microsoft Visual Studio Community. When you install Visual Studio, make sure to select the <strong>Desktop development with C++</strong> workload. For download links, see our <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads">Downloads</a> page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
When you install Visual Studio, you can optionally select the <strong>.NET desktop development</strong> and <strong>Universal Windows Platform development</strong> workloads for access to other project types and app platforms for building Windows apps.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to build your desktop app into an <a href="/windows/msix/desktop/desktop-to-uwp-root">MSIX package</a>, and test or debug the packaged app on your development computer, then you'll need to <a href="/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development">enable Developer Mode on your computer</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE]
For scripts you can use to set up your development computer and install other features or packages, see the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/windows-dev-box-setup-scripts">windows-dev-box-setup-scripts</a> GitHub repo.</p>

<h2>Modernize your desktop apps for Windows</h2>
<p>See <a href="/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/">Modernize your desktop apps</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have an existing desktop Win32 app, then there are many features in the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) that you can use to deliver your experience on Windows. For example, starting in Windows 10, version 1903, you can host UWP XAML controls in your desktop Win32 app using a feature called XAML Islands.</p>
<p>Most of those UWP features are available as modular components that you can adopt in your desktop app at your own pace without having to rewrite your entire application. You can enhance your existing desktop app by choosing which parts of Windows and UWP to adopt.</p>
<h2>C++/WinRT</h2>
<p>You can configure your development computer to use <a href="/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/">C++/WinRT</a>. C++/WinRT is an entirely standard modern C++17 language projection that enables you to easily consume Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs from your C++ Win32 desktop application. C++/WinRT is implemented as a header-file-based library.</p>
<p>To configure your project for C++/WinRT:</p>
<ul>
<li>For new projects, you can install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CppWinRTTeam.cppwinrt101804264">C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX)</a> and use one of the C++/WinRT project templates included in that extension.</li>
<li>For existing Windows desktop application projects, you can install the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT/">Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT</a> NuGet package in the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about these options, see <a href="/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt#visual-studio-support-for-cwinrt-xaml-the-vsix-extension-and-the-nuget-package">Visual Studio support for C++/WinRT, XAML, the VSIX extension, and the NuGet package</a>.</p>
<h2>What's new for Win32 APIs in Windows</h2>
<p>To learn about new Win32 APIs that have been introduced in Windows, see <a href="whats-new.html">what's new</a>.</p>
<h2>Get started with Win32 features and technologies</h2>
<p>Win32 APIs exist for many features and technologies in Windows, including core user interface and windowing APIs, audio and graphics, and networking. For guidance and code samples about using those APIs, see <a href="./desktop-app-technologies.html">Desktop app technologies</a>.</p>

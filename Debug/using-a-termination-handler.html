<h1>Using a Termination Handler</h1>
<p>The following example shows how a termination handler is used to ensure that resources are released when execution of a guarded body of code terminates. In this case, a thread uses the <a href="/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-entercriticalsection"><strong>EnterCriticalSection</strong></a> function to wait for ownership of a critical section object. When the thread is finished executing the code that is protected by the critical section, it must call the <a href="/windows/win32/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-leavecriticalsection"><strong>LeaveCriticalSection</strong></a> function to make the critical section object available to other threads. Using a termination handler guarantees that this will happen. For more information, see <a href="../sync/critical-section-objects.html">critical section objects</a>.</p>
<pre lang="C++"><code>LPTSTR lpBuffer = NULL; 
CRITICAL_SECTION CriticalSection; 

// EnterCriticalSection synchronizes code with other threads. 
EnterCriticalSection(&amp;CriticalSection); 
 
__try 
{ 
    // Perform a task that may cause an exception. 
    lpBuffer = (LPTSTR) LocalAlloc(LPTR, 10); 
    StringCchCopy(lpBuffer, 10, TEXT(&quot;Hello&quot;));

    _tprintf(TEXT(&quot;%s\n&quot;),lpBuffer); 
    LocalFree(lpBuffer); 
} 
__finally 
{ 
    // LeaveCriticalSection is called even if an exception occurred. 
    LeaveCriticalSection(&amp;CriticalSection); 
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Intel AVX</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Intel Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) is a 256-bit SIMD floating point vector extension of Intel architecture. It includes extensions to both instruction and register sets.</p>
<p>Microsoft has developed some API enhancements, such as XState functions, that enable applications to access and manipulate extended processor feature information and state, including Intel AVX.</p>

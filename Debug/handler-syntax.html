<h1>Handler Syntax</h1>
<p>This section describes the syntax and usage of structured exception handling as implemented in the Microsoft C/C++ Optimizing Compiler. The following keywords are interpreted by the compiler as part of the structured exception-handling mechanism.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Keyword</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>__try</strong></td>
<td>Begins a guarded body of code. Used with the <strong>__except</strong> keyword to construct an <a href="exception-handler-syntax.html">exception handler</a>, or with the <strong>__finally</strong> keyword to construct a <a href="termination-handler-syntax.html">termination handler</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>__except</strong></td>
<td>Begins a block of code that is executed only when an exception occurs within its associated <strong>__try</strong> block.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>__finally</strong></td>
<td>Begins a block of code that is executed whenever the flow of control leaves its associated <strong>__try</strong> block.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>__leave</strong></td>
<td>Allows for immediate termination of the <strong>__try</strong> block without causing abnormal termination and its performance penalty.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Â </p>
<p>The compiler also interprets the <a href="getexceptioncode.html"><strong>GetExceptionCode</strong></a>, <a href="getexceptioninformation.html"><strong>GetExceptionInformation</strong></a>, and <a href="abnormaltermination.html"><strong>AbnormalTermination</strong></a> functions as keywords, and their use outside the appropriate exception-handling syntax generates a compiler error. The following are brief descriptions of these functions.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Function</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="getexceptioncode.html"><strong>GetExceptionCode</strong></a></td>
<td>Returns a code that identifies the type of exception. This function can be called only from within the filter expression or the exception-handler block.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="getexceptioninformation.html"><strong>GetExceptionInformation</strong></a></td>
<td>Returns a pointer to an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/WinNT/ns-winnt-exception_pointers"><strong>EXCEPTION_POINTERS</strong></a> structure containing pointers to the context record and the exception record. This function can be called only from within the filter expression of an exception handler.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="abnormaltermination.html"><strong>AbnormalTermination</strong></a></td>
<td>Indicates whether the flow of control left the associated <strong>__try</strong> block sequentially after executing the last statement in the block. This function can be called only from within the <strong>__finally</strong> block of a termination handler.</td>
</tr>

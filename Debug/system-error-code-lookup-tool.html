<h1>The Microsoft Error Lookup Tool</h1>
<p>The Microsoft Error Lookup Tool displays the message text that is associated with a hexadecimal status code (or other code). This text is defined in various Microsoft source-code header files, such as Winerror.h, Setupapi.h, and so on.</p>
<p>The tool is digitally signed by Microsoft. The following is the SHA256 information for the file download:</p>

<h2>More information</h2>
<p>Keep in mind that this is a &quot;point-in-time&quot; tool. The Microsoft Error Lookup Tool decodes most Microsoft error codes as of the date on which the tool was compiled. As new releases of Windows add new event and error codes, you may have to download a new version of the Error Lookup Tool. Check the Microsoft Download Center for a new version, or see <a href="system-error-codes.html">Error Codes</a>.</p>

<h1>Create your first Windows app using DirectX</h1>
<p>If you know DirectX, you can develop a DirectX app using native C++ and HLSL to take full advantage of graphics hardware.</p>
<p>Use this basic tutorial to get started with DirectX app development, then use the roadmap to continue exploring DirectX.</p>
<h2>Windows desktop app with C++ and DirectX</h2>
<p>A Windows desktop app with DirectX is an app developed using native C++ and DirectX APIs. This model is more complex than an app written in a managed framework, but it provides greater flexibility and greater access to system resources especially graphics devices. So, it is a good model for the experienced developer.</p>
<h2>Why develop a Windows app with DirectX?</h2>
<p>The answer is simple: you want to make a game that is graphics- or multimedia-intensive, and can use the features that many graphics devices support. This won't be easy if you are new to game development or to Windows development and C/C++, but there's some good news: DirectX 11 is the simplest and most cohesive version of Microsoft DirectX yet. It's also the most powerful and feature-rich. If your goal is to master game development and learn the most advanced rendering techniques, then DirectX can provide the opportunity for you to do that.</p>
<p>That said, planning your game (or interactive, real-time app) is essential. If you are new to game development, and your game doesn't have demanding graphics requirements, consider developing it with the .NET framework instead. Also, many &quot;middleware&quot; graphics and game development packages are available for Windows platforms, and some do not require significant programming skills.</p>
<p>If you are confident, or simply have a dream of making a game with high-fidelity graphics (or an app with complex graphics content), then read on!</p>

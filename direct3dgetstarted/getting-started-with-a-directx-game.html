<h1>Get started with DirectX for Windows</h1>
<p>Creating a Microsoft DirectX game for Windows is a challenge for a new developer. Here we quickly review the concepts involved and the steps you must take to begin developing a game using DirectX and C++.</p>
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<h2>What skills do you need?</h2>
<p>To develop a game in DirectX for Windows, you must have a few basic skills. Specifically, you must be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read and write modern C++ code (C++11 helps the most), and be familiar with basic C++ design principles and patterns like templates and the factory model. You must also be familiar with common C++ libraries like the Standard Template Library, and specifically with the casting operators, pointer types, and the standard template library data structures (such as std::vector).</li>
<li>Understand basic geometry, trigonometry, and linear algebra. Much of the code you will find in the examples assumes you understand these forms of mathematics and their common rules.</li>
<li>Have familiarity with COMâ€”especially <a href="/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2012/br244983(v=vs.110)"><strong>Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr</strong></a> (smart pointer).</li>
<li>Understand the foundations of graphics and graphics technology, particularly 3D graphics. While DirectX itself has its own terminology, it still builds upon a well-established understanding of general 3D graphics principles.</li>
<li>Understand the concept of a message loop, because you'll be implementing a loop that listens to the Windows operating system.</li>
</ul>
<h2>And we're off!</h2>
<p>Ready to start? Let's review before we head on. You have:</p>
<ul>
<li>An updated and working installation of WindowsÂ 8.1.</li>
<li>An installation of <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>.</li>
<li>An intrepid spirit and a desire to learn more about DirectX game development!</li>
</ul>

<h1>Synchronization Barriers</h1>
<p>A synchronization barrier enables multiple threads to wait until all threads have all reached a particular point of execution before any thread continues. Synchronization barriers cannot be shared across processes.</p>
<p>Synchronization barriers are useful for phased computations, in which threads executing the same code in parallel must all complete one phase before moving on to the next.</p>
<p>To create a synchronization barrier, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/SynchAPI/nf-synchapi-initializesynchronizationbarrier"><strong>InitializeSynchronizationBarrier</strong></a> function and specify a maximum number of threads and how many times a thread should spin before it blocks. Then launch the threads that will use the barrier. After each thread finishes its work, it calls <a href="/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-entersynchronizationbarrier"><strong>EnterSynchronizationBarrier</strong></a> to wait at the barrier. The <strong>EnterSynchronizationBarrier</strong> function blocks each thread until the number of threads blocked in the barrier reaches the maximum thread count for the barrier, at which point <strong>EnterSynchronizationBarrier</strong> unblocks all the threads. The <strong>EnterSynchronizationBarrier</strong> function returns <strong>TRUE</strong> for exactly one of the threads that entered the barrier, and returns <strong>FALSE</strong> for all other threads.</p>
<p>To release a synchronization barrier when it is no longer needed, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/SynchAPI/nf-synchapi-deletesynchronizationbarrier"><strong>DeleteSynchronizationBarrier</strong></a>. It is safe to call this function immediately after calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-entersynchronizationbarrier"><strong>EnterSynchronizationBarrier</strong></a> because that function ensures that all threads have finished using the barrier before it is released.</p>
<p>If a synchronization barrier will never be deleted, threads can specify the <strong>SYNCHRONIZATION_BARRIER_FLAGS_NO_DELETE</strong> flag when they enter the barrier. All threads using the barrier must specify this flag; if any thread does not, the flag is ignored. This flag causes the function to skip the extra work required for deletion safety, which can improve performance. Note that deleting a barrier while this flag is in effect may result in an invalid handle access and one or more permanently blocked threads.</p>

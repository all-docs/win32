<h1>Network Tracing in Windows 7</h1>
<p>As the complexity of the networking stack increases, it is often difficult to quickly trace and diagnose issues within the stack. Windows 7 expands on the Network Diagnostic Framework (NDF) to provide a quick method for troubleshooting network connectivity issues by enabling collection of all the needed information in one step, and by leveraging <a href="../etw/event-tracing-portal.html">Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)</a> to log network events &amp; packets in a single file.</p>
<p>Related events and packets are grouped together for a given activity, such as browsing a website, across the various components in the networking stack. The output of this process is an Event Trace Log (ETL) file. By allowing all of the events related to a specific activity to be viewed at once in this file, the time required to isolate and diagnose network issues can be greatly reduced.</p>

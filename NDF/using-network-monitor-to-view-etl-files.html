<h1>Using Network Monitor to View ETL Files</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=4865">Microsoft Network Monitor 3.4 (archive)</a> enables users to parse, filter, and view an ETL file (using Windows Vista or later).</p>
<p>Correlated ETL files group the relevant events together. The illlustration below shows a correlated file opened in Network Monitor, with conversation enabled.</p>
<p><img src="images/ut-netmon1.png" alt="Screenshot that shows the Network Monitor, with correlated events highlighted in the left window and UTEvent highlighted from the drop-down." /></p>
<p>Correlated events are grouped by activity in the left pane. You can select an event in the Frame Summary pane, then right-click to select the conversation at the network event level. This will display a related activity in the left pane.</p>
<p>Selecting a particular activity from the left pane and expanding it will show the list of providers for the correlated events.</p>
<p><img src="images/ut-netmon2.png" alt="Screenshot that shows the Network Monitor with an activity selected from the left pane and events corresponding to that event in the right pane." /></p>
<p>When you select a specific provider in the left pane, a list of events specific to that provider and activity will be displayed in the Frame Summary pane.</p>
<p><img src="images/ut-netmon3.png" alt="Screenshot that shows a specific provider selected in the left pane, and a list of events specific to the provider highlighted in the top-right pane." /></p>
<p>Filters can be applied in Network Monitor to make it easier to view and find the right events or packet. For example, you can apply a filter to selected error events (for example, <strong>UTEvent.Header.Descriptor.Level == 2</strong>) to display them in a certain color.</p>
<p><img src="images/ut-netmon4.png" alt="Screenshot that shows the 'Edit Color Filter' dialog." /></p>
<p>Filters can also be applied to mark different providers in different colors so that the results are easier to view.</p>

<p>To apply a filter, click <strong>ColorFilters</strong> on the <strong>Filters</strong> menu.</p>
<p>The following table shows some examples of useful filters.</p>
<table>

<th>Filter</th>

<tr>
<td>UTEvent.Header.Descriptor.Level == 2</td>
<td>Filters only error events.</td>

<h1>UI guidelines for NDF helper class extensions</h1>
<p>When building your helper class, you will need to create text to help the user understand the cause of an incident and the possible repair steps which can be taken.</p>
<h2>Root Cause and Repair</h2>
<p>When an incident occurs, a dialog box will appear to inform the user about what has happened. The text that you create will appear in two separate areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Root Cause</strong>: A brief description of the cause of the issue. Contains information to help an administrator or advanced user troubleshoot the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Repair</strong>: Expands on the root cause to provide more details about the steps that a user can take, without getting too lengthy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each root cause or repair should have a title and a description. All text before the first &quot;\n&quot; character will be used for the title. All text following the first &quot;\n&quot; character (including any subsequent line breaks) will be used for the description.</p>
<h2>Title Guidelines</h2>
<p>The title of a root cause or repair should follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be 128 characters or fewer. (40 characters or less is recommended.)</li>
<li>Should not end with a period.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Description Guidelines</h2>
<p>The description of a root cause or repair should follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must be 512 characters or fewer.</li>
<li>Each sentence should end with a period.</li>
<li>The &quot;\n&quot; character may be used to create a line break in the description.</li>
</ul>

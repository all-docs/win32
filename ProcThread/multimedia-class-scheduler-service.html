<h1>Multimedia Class Scheduler Service</h1>
<p>The Multimedia Class Scheduler service (MMCSS) enables multimedia applications to ensure that their time-sensitive processing receives prioritized access to CPU resources. This service enables multimedia applications to utilize as much of the CPU as possible without denying CPU resources to lower-priority applications.</p>
<p>MMCSS uses information stored in the registry to identify supported tasks and determine the relative priority of threads performing these tasks. Each thread that is performing work related to a particular task calls the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Avrt/nf-avrt-avsetmmmaxthreadcharacteristicsa"><strong>AvSetMmMaxThreadCharacteristics</strong></a> or <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Avrt/nf-avrt-avsetmmthreadcharacteristicsa"><strong>AvSetMmThreadCharacteristics</strong></a> function to inform MMCSS that it is working on that task.</p>
<p>For an example of a program that uses MMCSS, see <a href="/previous-versions//bb614507(v=vs.85)">Exclusive-Mode Streams</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows ServerÂ 2003 and WindowsÂ XP:</strong> MMCSS is not available.</p>
<h2>Registry Settings</h2>
<p>The MMCSS settings are stored in the following registry key:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Multimedia\SystemProfile</strong></p>
<p>This key contains a <strong>REG_DWORD</strong> value named <strong>SystemResponsiveness</strong> that determines the percentage of CPU resources that should be guaranteed to low-priority tasks. For example, if this value is 20, then 20% of CPU resources are reserved for low-priority tasks. Note that values that are not evenly divisible by 10 are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10. A value of 0 is also treated as 10.</p>
<p>The key also contains a subkey named <strong>Tasks</strong> that contains the list of tasks. By default, Windows supports the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Audio</strong></li>
<li><strong>Capture</strong></li>
<li><strong>Distribution</strong></li>
<li><strong>Games</strong></li>
<li><strong>Playback</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pro Audio</strong></li>
<li><strong>Window Manager</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>OEMs can add additional tasks as required.</p>
<p>Each task key contains the following set of values that represent characteristics to be applied to threads that are associated with the task.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Format</th>
<th>Possible values</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Affinity</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_DWORD</strong></td>
<td>A bitmask that indicates the processor affinity. Both 0x00 and 0xFFFFFFFF indicate that processor affinity is not used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Background Only</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_SZ</strong></td>
<td>Indicates whether this is a background task (no user interface). The threads of a background task do not change because of a change in window focus. This value can be set to True or False.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>BackgroundPriority</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_DWORD</strong></td>
<td>The background priority. The range of values is 1-8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Clock Rate</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_DWORD</strong></td>
<td>A hint used by MMCSS to determine the granularity of processor resource scheduling.<strong>Windows ServerÂ 2008 and WindowsÂ Vista:</strong> The maximum guaranteed clock rate the system uses if a thread joins this task, in 100-nanosecond intervals. Starting with WindowsÂ 7 and Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2, this guarantee was removed to reduce system power consumption.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>GPU Priority</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_DWORD</strong></td>
<td>The GPU priority. The range of values is 0-31. This priority is not yet used.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Priority</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_DWORD</strong></td>
<td>The task priority. The range of values is 1 (low) to 8 (high).For tasks with a <strong>Scheduling Category</strong> of High, this value is always treated as 2.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Scheduling Category</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_SZ</strong></td>
<td>The scheduling category. This value can be set to High, Medium, or Low.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>SFIO Priority</strong></td>
<td><strong>REG_SZ</strong></td>
<td>The scheduled I/O priority. This value can be set to Idle, Low, Normal, or High. This value is not used.</td>
</tr>

To conserve power, applications should not set the resolution of the system-wide timer to a small value unless absolutely necessary.

<h2>Thread Priorities</h2>
<p>The MMCSS boosts the priority of threads that are working on high-priority multimedia tasks.</p>
<p>MMCSS determines the priority of a thread using the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The base priority of the task.</li>
<li>The <em>Priority</em> parameter of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Avrt/nf-avrt-avsetmmthreadpriority"><strong>AvSetMmThreadPriority</strong></a> function.</li>
<li>Whether the application is in the foreground.</li>
<li>How much CPU time is being consumed by the threads in each category.</li>
</ul>
<p>MMCSS sets the priority of client threads depending on their scheduling category.</p>

<tr>
<td>High</td>
<td>23-26</td>
<td>These threads run at a thread priority that is lower than only certain system-level tasks. This category is designed for Pro Audio tasks.</td>

<td>16-22</td>
<td>These threads are part of the application that is in the foreground.</td>

<td>8-15</td>
<td>This category contains the remainder of the threads. They are guaranteed a minimum percentage of the CPU resources if required.</td>

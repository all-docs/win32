<h1>WSD Application Development on Windows</h1>
<p>The Microsoft Web Services on Devices API (WSDAPI) supports the implementation of client-controlled devices and services, and device hosts conforming to the <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/">Devices Profile for Web Services</a> (DPWS). WSDAPI may be used for the development of both client and server (device) implementations.</p>
<p>Quite often, WSDAPI code for these applications is generated using <a href="web-services-for-devices-code-generator.html">WsdCodeGen</a>. Some WSDAPI functions and methods are intended to be called only by generated code. The API reference documentation indicates when a function or method should be used or implemented only by generated code.</p>
<p>The Windows SDK includes some sample WSDL files, WsdCodeGen configuration files, and generated code. For more information, see <a href="wsdapi-samples.html">WSDAPI Samples</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to enumerate devices using the WSD protocol and query WSD device metadata, you can use the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fundisc/fd-portal">Function Discovery</a> API instead.</p>
<p>If you want to implement a WSD device that does not run Windows, see <a href="wsd-device-development.html">WSD Device Development</a>.</p>

<h1>WS-Discovery Specification Compliance</h1>
<p><a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/ws-discovery.pdf">WS-Discovery</a> describes how to perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Announce the availability of services on the local subnet</li>
<li>Search for services on the subnet</li>
<li>Locate a previously referenced service</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish this, WS-Discovery defines two one-way messages, <a href="hello-message.html">Hello</a> and <a href="bye-message.html">Bye</a>, and two bidirectional search messages, <a href="probe-message.html">Probe</a> and <a href="resolve-message.html">Resolve</a>.</p>
<p>WS-Discovery also provides addresses and a reserved port for IPv4 and IPv6 link local discovery. The specification also allows for alternate bindings to be defined elsewhere, such as the Probe over HTTP binding defined in the <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/">Devices Profile for Web Services</a> (DPWS).</p>
<p>The WS-Discovery specification describes elective functionality by using the terms MAY or SHOULD in a given implementation recommendation or restriction. Omitted functionality may be functionality described as REQUIRED in the WS-Discovery specification that was not implemented by WSDAPI, or it may be functionality that WSDAPI implemented in a method other in the one specified in the WS-Discovery specification.</p>
<p>This topic describes how WS-Discovery restrictions, requirements, and elective functionality are handled by the WSDAPI implementation. This topic is best read in tandem with the WS-Discovery specification.</p>
<h2>WS-Discovery and SOAP-over-UDP Support</h2>
<p>In SOAP-over-UDP, Section 3.2 specifies that the UDP message must fit in a 64K datagram. WSDAPI will accept 64K UDP messages, but the DPWS constraint of MAX_ENVELOPE_SIZE (32K) will constrain the message size. As required by <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/ws-discovery.pdf">WS-Discovery</a>, WSDAPI supports the message patterns described in Section 4.</p>
<p>WSDAPI may be configured to support the security model in Sections 7 and 8. When so configured, WSDAPI will sign outbound WS-Discovery messages and will validate signatures on inbound messages.</p>
<p>WSDAPI implements the retransmission algorithm defined in Appendix I as amended by DPWS Appendix I.</p>
<p>In WS-Discovery, WSDAPI uses the addresses specified in section 2.4. WSDAPI extends APP_MAX_DELAY from section 2.4, but not to the extent as defined in DPWS Appendix I. For more information about APP_MAX_DELAY, see <a href="additional-ws-discovery-functionality.html">Additional WS-Discovery Functionality</a>.</p>
<p>WS-Discovery describes the <code>uuid:</code> URI format recommendation in section 2.6, but WSDAPI overrides this recommendation. Instead, WSDAPI uses the <code>urn:uuid:</code> URI format described in DPWS.</p>
<p>Section 3 of WS-Discovery describes how a client interacts with a discovery proxy. WSDAPI does not recognize this interaction and ignores announcements from discovery proxies. In WindowsÂ 7, WSDAPI implements a private extension to the WS-Discovery protocol, WS-Discovery Remote Extensions, to allow discovery clients to search for services spread across many different networks by sending requests to centralized proxies.For more information, see <a href="additional-ws-discovery-functionality.html">Additional WS-Discovery Functionality</a>.</p>
<p>Section 4.1, paragraph 3 of WS-Discovery requires that a timer must elapse before a <a href="hello-message.html">Hello</a> message is sent. The hosting API does not wait before sending a Hello message. If a scenario requires a delay before a Hello message is sent, then the application developer must implement a wait.</p>
<p>WSDAPI implements all of the messages described in WS-Discovery Sections 4, 5, and 6. WSDAPI also enforces the MATCH_TIMEOUT described in Section 7 as amended by DPWS Appendix I. WSDAPI only protects against &quot;Replay&quot; from the secure considerations in Section 9.</p>
<p>WSDAPI does implement application sequencing as described in WS-Discovery Appendix I.</p>

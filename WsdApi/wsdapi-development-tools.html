<h1>WSDAPI Development Tools</h1>
<p>The WSDAPI development tools included in the Windows SDK (WSD CodeGen, WSD Debug Host, and WSD Debug Client) enable developers to create and debug WSDAPI-based clients and devices. The source code for these tools is not available. SDK tools are located in the following directory: &lt;Windows SDK Install Folder&gt;\Bin.</p>
<p>WSD CodeGen (wsdcodegen.exe) converts a WSDL contract into generated C++ code, which developers can call directly into. It handles the data serialization and wire representation so developers can focus on designing applications. For more information about WSD CodeGen, see <a href="web-services-for-devices-code-generator.html">Web Services on Devices Code Generator</a>. This tool is available in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) and in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p>The WSD Debug Host (wsddebug_host.exe) and WSD Debug Client (wsddebug_client.exe) tools help developers debug their clients and hosts. These tools can be used to verify and inspect WS-Discovery and metadata exchange traffic. For more information about WSD Debug Host and WSD Debug Client, see <a href="debugging-tools.html">Debugging Tools</a>. These tools are available only in the Windows SDK.</p>
<p>There is an additional development tool, named <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc264250.aspx">WSDAPI Basic Interoperability Tool (WSDBIT)</a>, that is available only in the WDK. This tool is used for testing service methods, Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM), attachments or WS-Eventing.</p>

<h1>WS-MetadataExchange and WS-Transfer Specification Compliance</h1>
<p>Before August 2006, <a href="https://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/mex/">WS-MetadataExchange</a> defined its own <a href="get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.html">Get</a> metadata exchange method, which was used by <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/">Devices Profile for Web Services</a> (DPWS). The WS-MetadataExchange specification version 1.1 replaced this method with the Get method defined in the WS-Transfer specification.</p>
<p>In the current model, WS-Transfer provides the <a href="get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.html">Get</a> method and makes no reference to the type of the body. WS-MetadataExchange describes the format of the body and a mechanism for packaging multiple pieces of metadata in a single response, and DPWS describes specific pieces of metadata that a service should include in a metadata response.</p>
<p>WSDAPI does not fully support the WS-Transfer specification. Because only the <a href="get--metadata-exchange--http-request-and-message.html">Get</a> method is required for devices, no other portions of WS-Transfer have been implemented. Also, WSDAPI does not implement the optional GetMetadata method described in WS-MetadataExchange.</p>

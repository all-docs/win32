<h1>Troubleshooting WSDAPI Applications Using Directed Discovery</h1>
<p>Applications that use directed discovery send <a href="probe-message.html">Probe</a> messages over HTTP or HTTPS to discover devices. The corresponding <a href="probematches-message.html">ProbeMatches</a> messages sent in response are also sent over HTTP or HTTPS. Directed discovery can be initiated by the Add Printer Wizard, a Function Discovery client, or a WSDAPI application. The Probe and ProbeMatches messages are structurally identical to those sent over UDP. The messages are prefixed with the appropriate HTTP or HTTPS headers.</p>
<p>The following diagnostic procedures should be used (in order) to help identify problems with an application using directed discovery.</p>
<p><strong>To troubleshoot a WSDAPI application using directed discovery</strong></p>

<h1>Web Services on Devices</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Microsoft Web Services on Devices API (WSDAPI) supports the implementation of client-controlled devices and services, and device hosts conforming to the <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/">Devices Profile for Web Services</a> (DPWS). WSDAPI uses <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/04/discovery/ws-discovery.pdf">WS-Discovery</a> for device discovery.</p>
<p>WSDAPI may be used for the development of both client and service implementations.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>Web Services on Devices allows a client to discover and access a remote device and its associated services across a network. It supports device discovery, description, control, and eventing. Developers can create WSDAPI client proxies and corresponding stubs for device hosts.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>The Web Services on Devices documentation is intended for C/C++ programmers and device vendors creating DPWS-compliant products.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>Client applications that use WSDAPI are supported starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.</p>

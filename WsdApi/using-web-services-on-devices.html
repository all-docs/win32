<h1>Using Web Services on Devices</h1>
<p>The Microsoft Web Services on Devices API (WSDAPI) supports the implementation of client-controlled devices and services, and device hosts conforming to the <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/">Devices Profile for Web Services</a> (DPWS). WSDAPI may be used for the development of both client and server (device) implementations.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, use WSDAPI to create a Windows-based WSD client or device host application. Using WSDAPI reduces the complexity of development and saves time. For more information, see <a href="wsd-application-development-on-windows.html">WSD Application Development on Windows</a> and <a href="wsdapi-development-tools.html">WSDAPI Development Tools</a>.</p>
<p>You can also create WSD devices that do not run Windows and are interoperable with Windows-based WSD clients and device hosts. These devices must meet specific requirements to maintain interoperability. For more information, see <a href="wsd-device-development.html">WSD Device Development</a>.</p>

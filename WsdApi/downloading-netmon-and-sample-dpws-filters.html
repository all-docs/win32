<h1>Downloading Netmon and Sample DPWS Filters</h1>
<p>Microsoft Network Monitor 3 (Netmon) is a packet analyzer used to inspect network traffic. Netmon must be downloaded before the troubleshooting steps given in <a href="inspecting-network-traces-for-udp-ws-discovery.html">Inspecting Network Traces for UDP WS-Discovery</a> and <a href="inspecting-network-traces-for-http-metadata-exchange.html">Inspecting Network Traces for HTTP Metadata Exchange</a> can be followed. After Netmon has been downloaded, DPWS filters can be used to help isolate traffic of interest.</p>
<h2>Downloading Netmon</h2>
<p>To download Netmon, go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=4865">Microsoft Network Monitor</a>, and follow the instructions. For more information about Netmon, see <a href="/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/network-monitor-3">Information about Network Monitor 3.0</a>.</p>
<h2>Sample DPWS Filters</h2>
<p>Sometimes, WS-Discovery and metadata exchange troubleshooting must take place on a busy network. The sample filters can be used to help limit the Netmon output to traffic of interest. For more information about using Netmon filters, see <a href="/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/network-monitor-3">Information about Network Monitor 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>The following example shows a filter that limits output to all broadcast WS-Discovery traffic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
This filter does not capture traffic from stacks that do not respond to multicast WS-Discovery messages that originate at port 3702. If such a stack is being used, then this sample filter must be modified before use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>// All broadcast WS-Discovery traffic
UDP.Port == 3702
</code></pre>
<p>The following example shows a filter that limits output to HTTP messages sent to WSDAPI stacks on the default port.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
Services may send relevant HTTP messages from ports other than 5357. If traffic from other ports is of interest, then this sample filter must be modified before use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>// HTTP messages sent to WSDAPI stacks on default port
TCP.Port == 5357
</code></pre>
<p>The following example shows a filter that limits output to IPv4 multicast traffic.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>// All IPv4 multicast traffic
IPv4.DestinationAddress == 239.255.255.250
</code></pre>
<p>The following example shows a filter that limits output to IPv6 multicast traffic.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>// All IPv6 multicast traffic
IPv6.DestinationAddress == FF02::C
</code></pre>
<p>Some filters can be combined to further limit results. The following example shows a filter that limits output to IPv4 multicast WS-Discovery traffic.</p>
<pre lang="syntax"><code>// All IPv4 multicast WS-Discovery traffic
UDP.Port==3702 &amp;&amp; IPv4.DestinationAddress=239.255.255.250
</code></pre>
<p>When these filters are used, relevant traffic may be excluded from the Netmon results. Exclusion can occur when services reside at ports other than the default ports (5357/5358) and when a DPWS stack does not respond to messages using the default port. In these cases, the filters must be modified before use.</p>

<h1>Web Services on Devices Code Generator</h1>
<p>The Web Services on Devices code generator, WsdCodeGen, is a command-line utility that generates program code from a service description. The service description is stored in WSDL and/or XSD files. WsdCodeGen creates C++ and IDL (Interface Definition Language) files. Developers can use WsdCodeGen to create WSDAPI applications without worrying about how the data is marshaled and represented on the wire.</p>
<p>WsdCodeGen can be used to generate code for a service, a client, or both. The utility generates stub code for services, proxy code for clients, and interface and type code for both.</p>
<p>This tool is available in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) and in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). SDK tools are located in the following directory: &lt;Windows SDK Install Folder&gt;\Bin.</p>
<p>The Windows SDK includes sample code generated by WsdCodeGen. For more information, see <a href="wsdapi-samples.html">WSDAPI Samples</a>.</p>

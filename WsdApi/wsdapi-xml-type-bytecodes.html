<h1>WSDAPI XML Type Bytecodes</h1>
<p>These bytecodes are used by WSDAPI to parse and generate XML using bytecode tables which describe complex types.</p>
<p>The bytecode table for a type expresses both the binary (in-memory) and XML (on-the-wire) representations of the type. A bytecode table consists of a list of operations terminated by a special operation, namely <code>OpEndOfTable</code>. An operation consists of a one-byte operation code followed by zero or more bytes of argument data.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>OpNone</td>
<td>Matches nothing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpEndOfTable</td>
<td>Indicates the end of a bytecode table.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpBeginElement (name)</td>
<td>Matches an element start token with the indicated name. The name appears in the table in 4-byte encoded form. OnBeginElement starts a clause that ends with a matching OpEndElement. Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginElement and its matching OpEndElement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpBeginAnyElement</td>
<td>Matches an element start token with any name. OnBeginAnyElement starts a clause that ends with a matching OpEndElement. Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginAnyElement and its matching OpEndElement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpEndElement</td>
<td>Ends a clause started with OpBeginElement or OpBeginAnyElement.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpElement (name)</td>
<td>Matches an entire element with the indicated name. The name appears in the table in 4-byte encoded form.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpAnyElement</td>
<td>Matches an entire element with any name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpAnyElements</td>
<td>Matches any number of elements with any names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpAnyText</td>
<td>Matches a text token.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpAttribute (name)</td>
<td>Matches the label token of an attribute with the indicated name. OpAttribute starts a clause that includes the subsequent clause in the table. The subsequent clause is used to match the value part of the attribute. OpAttribute clauses always appear after OpBeginElement or OpBeginAnyElement operations or after another OpAttribute clause.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpBeginChoice</td>
<td>OpBeginChoice starts a clause that ends with a matching OpEndChoice. Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginChoice and its matching OpEndChoice. The outer clause matches the tokens matched by any one of the inner clauses. All of the inner clauses must start with OpBeginElement except that the last one may be OpAnything. This construct corresponds to the XSD choice particle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpEndChoice</td>
<td>Ends a clause started with OpBeginChoice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpBeginSequence</td>
<td>OpBeginSequence starts a clause that ends with a matching OpEndSequence. Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginSequence and OpEndSequence. The outer clause matches the tokens matched by all the inner clauses in sequence. This construct corresponds to the XSD sequence particle.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpEndSequence</td>
<td>Ends a clause started with OpBeginSequence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OpBeginAll</td>
<td>OpBeginAll starts a clause that ends with a matching OpEndAll. Zero or more complete clauses must appear between OpBeginAll and OpEndAll. The outer clause matches the tokens matched by the inner clauses in any sequence. Occurrence operators relating to each inner clause indicate how many times the tokens for each clause may occur. The default is once. Multiple occurrences of a specified clause may be intermixed with occurrences of other inner clauses. All of the inner clauses must start with OpBeginElement except that the last one may be OpAnything. This construct corresponds to the XSD all particle.</td>

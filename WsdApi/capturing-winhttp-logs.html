<h1>Capturing WinHTTP Logs</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[!IMPORTANT]
This procedure is available only for OS versions prior to Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.</p>

<p><a href="/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page">WinHTTP</a> logs can be used to help troubleshoot WSDAPI applications. This is helpful when metadata exchange fails or when SSL/TLS negotiation fails.</p>
<p>This procedure shows how to capture WinHTTP logs on the client PC. The WSDAPI-based client application must not be running when logging is enabled. If the client application is running when logging is enabled, the client and/or the PC must be restarted before WS-Discovery and metadata exchange traffic will appear in the WinHTTP logs.</p>
<p><strong>To capture WinHTTP logs</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open an elevated command prompt window on the client PC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following command: <strong>netsh winhttp set tracing trace-file-prefix=&quot;C:\Temp\dpws&quot; level=verbose format=ansi state=enabled max-trace-file-size=1073741824</strong></p>
<p>This command enables WinHTTP logging. All log files will be stored in the C:\Temp directory, and the filenames will begin with the dpws prefix. At most 1 GB of log files will be stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the process using WinHTTP on the client is already running, restart the computer. For example, if the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fundisc/fd-portal">Function Discovery</a> APIs are being used, the computer must be restarted. The Function Discovery APIs call WinHTTP from inside a service host, which may have already started when tracing was enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start the WSDAPI-based client application. The application being debugged or the WSD Debug Client can be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reproduce the application failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminate the WSDAPI-based client application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the process using WinHTTP is not terminated with the client application, restart the computer. For example, if the <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/fundisc/fd-portal">Function Discovery</a> APIs are being used, the computer must be restarted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following command: <strong>netsh winhttp set tracing state=disabled</strong></p>
<p>This command disables WinHTTP logging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspect the DPWS logs in C:\Temp and verify that the required requests and messages were sent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If secure channel (HTTPS) communication is being used, check for SSL/TLS failures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once WinHTTP logs have been captured, the logs can be examined to look for the cause of a WSDAPI application failure. Note that the text editor used to view these logs must be run as Administrator.

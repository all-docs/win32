<h1>WSD Device Development</h1>
<p>Device manufacturers and other device implementers can create devices that interoperate with Windows-based WSDAPI clients and hosts without using WSDAPI.</p>
<p>In addition to developing the device functionality, device implementers must implement the <a href="https://specs.xmlsoap.org/ws/2006/02/devprof/">Devices Profile for Web Services</a> (DPWS).</p>
<p>Whenever possible, use WSDAPI to create a Windows-based WSD client or device host application. Using WSDAPI reduces the complexity of development and saves time. For more information, see <a href="wsd-application-development-on-windows.html">WSD Application Development on Windows</a>.</p>

<h1>WIA Event Identifiers</h1>
<p>WIA event identifiers are globally unique identifiers (GUID) defined by the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) system.</p>
<p>A WIA application can subscribe to these non-persistent events by using <a href="-wia-iwiadevmgr2-registereventcallbackinterface.html"><strong>IwiaDevMgr2::RegisterEventCallbackInterface</strong></a> to receive device status change notifications from the WIA device to which the current WIA application session is connected. The WIA mini-driver must ensure that WIA_DPS_DOCUMENT_HANDLING_STATUS is correctly updated before the driver signals one of these events.</p>
<p>The following are valid WIA event GUIDs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>GUID</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_CANCEL_IO</td>
<td>The application attempts to cancel a data transfer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_COVER_CLOSED</td>
<td>All scanner covers are closed. If there were multiple scanner covers opened, the WIA minidriver should signal this event only when the last cover was closed. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_COVER_OPEN</td>
<td>A scanner cover was opened by the operator. The device cannot scan at this time. The WIA minidriver should signal this event only once if multiple scanner covers are opened in succession. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_DEVICE_CONNECTED</td>
<td>A WIA hardware device was connected to the user's computer or started.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_DEVICE_DISCONNECTED</td>
<td>A WIA hardware device was disconnected from the user's computer or stopped.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_DEVICE_NOT_READY</td>
<td>The device entered not-ready state. The application should read WIA_DPS_DOCUMENT_HANDLING_STATUS for more information. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_DEVICE_READY</td>
<td>The device entered ready state. The previous not-ready state signaled with WIA_EVENT_DEVICE_NOT_READY was cleared. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_FEEDER_EMPTIED</td>
<td>The operator removed all documents from the feeder input tray and the feeder is empty. The device cannot scan from the feeder at this time. Important: the minidriver must not signal this event when the feeder becomes empty as result of a scan job executed by an application. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_FEEDER_LOADED</td>
<td>The operator placed documents in the feeder input tray. The feeder is loaded with paper. The application can initiate a scan job from the feeder at this time. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_FLATBED_LID_CLOSED</td>
<td>The flatbed lid was closed by the operator. The application can initiate a scan job from the flatbed at this time. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_FLATBED_LID_OPEN</td>
<td>The flatbed lid was opened by the operator. The device cannot scan from the flatbed at this time. This feature is available starting with WindowsÂ 8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_ITEM_CREATED</td>
<td>An item was added to the tree of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wia_xp/nn-wia_xp-iwiaitem"><strong>IWiaItem</strong></a> or <a href="-wia-iwiaitem2.html"><strong>IWiaItem2</strong></a> objects for a WIA device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_ITEM_DELETED</td>
<td>An item was deleted from the tree of <a href="/windows/desktop/api/wia_xp/nn-wia_xp-iwiaitem"><strong>IWiaItem</strong></a> or <a href="-wia-iwiaitem2.html"><strong>IWiaItem2</strong></a> objects for a WIA device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_POWER_RESUME</td>
<td>Power has been restored to the device or computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_POWER_SUSPEND</td>
<td>Power has been suspended to the device or computer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_EMAIL_IMAGE</td>
<td>A scan was initiated with the intent to e-mail the resulting image.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_FAX_IMAGE</td>
<td>A scan was initiated with the intent to fax the resulting image.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_FILM_IMAGE</td>
<td>An image was scanned from a film adapter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_IMAGE</td>
<td>An image was scanned.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_IMAGE2</td>
<td>An image was scanned. This event allows scanners with more than one scan button to direct the buttons to different applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_IMAGE3</td>
<td>An image was scanned. This event allows scanners with more than one scan button to direct the buttons to different applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_IMAGE4</td>
<td>An image was scanned. This event allows scanners with more than one scan button to direct the buttons to different applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_OCR_IMAGE</td>
<td>A scan was initiated with the intent to convert the resulting image with optical character recognition (OCR).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_SCAN_PRINT_IMAGE</td>
<td>A scan was initiated with the intent to print the resulting image.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_STI_PROXY</td>
<td>Intended for internal use only. Do not use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_STORAGE_CREATED</td>
<td>A storage unit, such as a flash card, was added to the device. The application should re-create the item tree that represents this device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_STORAGE_DELETED</td>
<td>A storage unit, such as a flash card, was removed from the device. The application should re-create the item tree that represents this device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_TREE_UPDATED</td>
<td>The WIA item tree was updated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WIA_EVENT_VOLUME_INSERTED</td>
<td>A storage device, such as a flash card, was inserted into the device.</td>

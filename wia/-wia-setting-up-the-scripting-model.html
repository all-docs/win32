<h1>Setting up the Scripting Model Development Environment</h1>
<p>To use the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) scripting model, you must have the file Wiascr.dll installed and registered on the computer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
This scripting system has been replaced with Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) Automation Layer. See <a href="/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wiaaut/-wiaaut-startpage">Windows Image Acquisition Automation Layer</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p>Copy this file from the WIA SDK into the <em>%windir%</em>/System32 (for example, c:\windows\System32) directory. At the command line, navigate to this directory, and type <strong>regsvr32 Wiascr.dll</strong>.</p>
<p>This enters the necessary information in the system registry.</p>
<p>You are now ready to use the WIA scripting model.</p>

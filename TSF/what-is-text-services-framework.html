<h1>What is Text Services Framework?</h1>
<p>Text Services Framework (TSF) is a device-independent, language-neutral, and extensible system for text input and language technologies.</p>
<p>TSF-enabled applications can receive text input from any text service that supports TSF without having to be aware of any details of the text source.</p>
<p>Text services supply text to applications in a way that does not require any detailed knowledge of the applications that produce or receive the text. For example, a text service can provide text input from speech or handwriting input devices.</p>

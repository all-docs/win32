<h1>Compartments</h1>
<h2>Compartment Types</h2>
<p>There are several different types of compartments. There is a global compartment, and each thread manager, document manager, and context can contain a compartment.</p>
<p>The global compartment enables clients to share data across processes. To obtain the global compartment manager, call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfthreadmgr-getglobalcompartment"><strong>ITfThreadMgr::GetGlobalCompartment</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The thread manager contains a compartment manager that contains compartments on a per-thread basis. This allows data to be shared within a thread. To obtain a thread manager compartment manager, call <strong>ITfThreadMgr::QueryInterface</strong> with IID_ITfCompartmentMgr.</p>
<p>Each document manager created also contains a compartment manager. This allows data to be shared within a specific document manager. To obtain the document manager compartment manager, call <strong>ITfDocumentMgr::QueryInterface</strong> with IID_ITfCompartmentMgr.</p>
<p>Each context created also contains a compartment manager. This allows data to be shared within a specific context. To obtain a context compartment manager, call <strong>ITfContext::QueryInterface</strong> with IID_ITfCompartmentMgr.</p>
<h2>Creating and Deleting a Compartment</h2>
<p>A compartment is created the first time <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfcompartmentmgr-getcompartment"><strong>ITfCompartmentMgr::GetCompartment</strong></a> is called with the compartment GUID. The installing client should set the initial value of the compartment using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfcompartment-setvalue"><strong>ITfCompartment::SetValue</strong></a>. Until a value is set, the compartment value is empty. Because of this, there is no way to verify that the compartment existed before <strong>GetCompartment</strong> was called. To avoid this situation, the installing client should set the value to some initial value so that other clients can determine if the compartment already exists.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfcompartmentmgr-clearcompartment"><strong>ITfCompartmentMgr::ClearCompartment</strong></a> method is used to remove a compartment. Any existing references to the compartment are marked invalid.</p>
<h2>Obtaining Compartments</h2>
<p>Using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nn-msctf-itfcompartmentmgr"><strong>ITfCompartmentMgr</strong></a> interface, a client can enumerate compartments by calling <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfcompartmentmgr-enumcompartments"><strong>ITfCompartmentMgr::EnumCompartments</strong></a>. This method provides an <strong>IEnumGUID</strong> object that contains the GUIDs of all of the installed compartments.</p>
<p>Using the compartment GUID , <strong>ITfCompartmentMgr::GetCompartment</strong> is used to obtain a specific compartment. This method provides the caller with an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nn-msctf-itfcompartment"><strong>ITfCompartment</strong></a> object that can obtain and set the compartment data.</p>
<h2>Receiving Compartment Change Notifications</h2>
<p>When the value of a compartment changes, the TSF manager notifies any installed advise sinks that the compartment has changed. To install a compartment change advise sink, create an object that implements <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nn-msctf-itfcompartmenteventsink"><strong>ITfCompartmentEventSink</strong></a>. Then call <strong>ITfCompartment::QueryInterface</strong> with IID_ITfSource on the compartment object to be monitored to obtain an <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nn-msctf-itfsource"><strong>ITfSource</strong></a> interface. Now call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfsource-advisesink"><strong>ITfSource::AdviseSink</strong></a> with IID_ITfCompartmentEventSink and the pointer to the <strong>ITfCompartmentEventSink</strong> object. When the value of the compartment changes, the advise sink's <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfcompartmenteventsink-onchange"><strong>ITfCompartmentEventSink::OnChange</strong></a> is called with the GUID of the compartment. The advise sink can call <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Msctf/nf-msctf-itfcompartment-getvalue"><strong>ITfCompartment::GetValue</strong></a> to obtain the new value.</p>

<h1>Text Services Framework (Text Services Framework)</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Microsoft Windows Text Services Framework (TSF) is a system service available as a redistributable for Windows. TSF provides a simple and scalable framework for the delivery of advanced text input and natural language technologies. TSF can be enabled in applications, or as a TSF text service. A TSF text service provides multilingual support and delivers text services such as keyboard processors, handwriting recognition, and speech recognition.</p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>Text Services Framework is applicable for Windows-based computers using text services and Windows XP or later versions of the operating system.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>Text Services Framework is designed for use by Component Object Model (COM) programmers using the C/C++ programming languages. Programmers should be familiar with text services for Windows-based computers. Knowledge of handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and programming for multilingual support is recommended.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>For the latest redistributable, download the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk">Windows 10 platform SDK</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the requirements of specific API elements, see the Requirements section in the <a href="/windows/win32/tsf/text-services-framework-reference">TFS reference documentation</a>.</p>

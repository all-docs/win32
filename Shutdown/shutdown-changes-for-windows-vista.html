<h1>Shutdown Changes for Windows Vista</h1>
<p>The following table summarizes the differences between shutdown on WindowsÂ Vista and WindowsÂ XP.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th>Windows XP</th>
<th>Windows Vista</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Blocking shutdown</td>
<td>Applications can delay responding to <a href="wm-queryendsession.html"><strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong></a> for 5 seconds, then the system allows the user to terminate the application. Applications that return <strong>TRUE</strong> in response to <strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong> can delay responding to <a href="wm-endsession.html"><strong>WM_ENDSESSION</strong></a> for 5 seconds, then the system allows the user to terminate the application.</td>
<td>Applications can delay responding to <a href="wm-queryendsession.html"><strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong></a> for 5 seconds, then the system allows the user to continue or cancel shutdown. Applications that return <strong>TRUE</strong> in response to <strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong> can delay responding to <a href="wm-endsession.html"><strong>WM_ENDSESSION</strong></a> for 5 seconds, then the system allows the user to continue or cancel shutdown.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Canceling shutdown</td>
<td>If an application returns <strong>FALSE</strong> in response to <a href="wm-queryendsession.html"><strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong></a>, shutdown is canceled in most cases. However, no UI is displayed, so the user may not be aware that shutdown has been canceled.</td>
<td>If an application returns <strong>FALSE</strong> in response to <a href="wm-queryendsession.html"><strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong></a>, it still appears in the shutdown UI. Note that the system does not allow console applications or applications without a visible window to cancel shutdown. These applications are automatically terminated if they do not respond to <strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong> or <a href="wm-endsession.html"><strong>WM_ENDSESSION</strong></a> within 5 seconds or if they return <strong>FALSE</strong> in response to <strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Shutdown user interface</td>
<td>The system displays a dialog box for each application blocking shutdown. If the user click the <strong>End Now</strong> button, the application is terminated. If the user clicks the <strong>Cancel</strong> button, shutdown is canceled and the application continues to run.</td>
<td>The system displays a full-screen UI that identifies all applications blocking shutdown and their reasons for doing so (if they have registered a reason using <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-shutdownblockreasoncreate"><strong>ShutdownBlockReasonCreate</strong></a>).</td>
</tr>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Applications should not block shutdown. Respond to <a href="wm-queryendsession.html"><strong>WM_QUERYENDSESSION</strong></a> as quickly as possible and postpone cleanup activities until processing the <a href="wm-endsession.html"><strong>WM_ENDSESSION</strong></a> message.</li>
<li>Applications that must block shutdown should use the new <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Winuser/nf-winuser-shutdownblockreasoncreate"><strong>ShutdownBlockReasonCreate</strong></a> function to register a string that explains the reason to the user. The user can decide whether to continue or cancel shutdown.</li>
<li>Applications cannot rely on being able to block shutdown.</li>
</ul>

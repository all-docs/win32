<h1>IP addresses and computer names</h1>
<p>Multiple users can be logged on simultaneously to a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) server. Consequently, it is not safe to assume that the computer name or the IP address assigned to the computer are associated with a single user. This differs from a single-user Windows environment, in which only one user is logged on at a time.</p>
<p>Applications that use the computer name or IP address for licensing or as a means of identifying an iteration of the application on the network will not work properly in a Remote Desktop Services environment, because the server's computer name or IP address can be associated with many users.</p>
<p>In a Remote Desktop Services environment, each client terminal or terminal emulator has a separate IP address and computer name. To retrieve the IP address and computer name of a client, call the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Wtsapi32/nf-wtsapi32-wtsquerysessioninformationa"><strong>WTSQuerySessionInformation</strong></a> function. Other functions that retrieve these network addresses and computer names retrieve the name and address of the RDÂ Session Host server. For example, the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getcomputernameexa"><strong>GetComputerNameEx</strong></a> function returns the computer name of the server.</p>

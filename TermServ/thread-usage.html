<h1>Thread usage</h1>
<p>Threads provide a convenient way of allowing an application to maximize its usage of CPU resources in a system, especially in a multiple processor configuration. In a Remote Desktop Services environment, however, multiple users can be running multithreaded applications, and all of the threads for all of the users compete for the central CPU resources of that system. With this in mind, you should tune and balance application thread usage for a multiuser, multiprocessor Remote Desktop Services environment. While a poorly designed multithreaded application with idle or wasted threads might perform adequately on a client computer, the same application might not perform well on a multiuser Remote Desktop Services server.</p>

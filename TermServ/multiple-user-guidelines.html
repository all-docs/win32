<h1>Multiple-user guidelines</h1>
<p>The following sections provide guidelines for developing applications for multiple users in a Remote Desktop Services environment.</p>
<h2>In this section</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="application-setup-in-a-terminal-services-environment.html">Application setup</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Installing an application for a single user can create problems in a multiuser Remote Desktop Services environment.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="storing-user-specific-information.html">Storing user-specific information</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Applications should store user-specific information in user-specific locations, separately from global information that applies to all users.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="kernel-object-namespaces.html">Kernel object namespaces</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Remote Desktop Services uses multiple namespaces for kernel objects; a global namespace is used primarily by services in client/server applications.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="ip-addresses-and-computer-names.html">IP addresses and computer names</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is not safe to assume that the computer name or the IP address assigned to the computer are associated with a single user because multiple users can be logged on simultaneously to a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) server.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As always, lock files and databases while making changes to prevent inadvertent loss of data.</p>
<p>Your application must not lock any run-time application files that are not per-user files. Locked run-time files can keep multiple instances of the application, or processes under the application such as wizards, from running. A good way to test which files are run-time application files is to track which files are installed by the application setup. Per-user files are rarely installed by setup; therefore, most files installed by setup are run-time application files.</p>

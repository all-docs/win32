<h1>Guidelines for background tasks in Remote Desktop Services</h1>
<p>Background tasksâ€”tasks performed when an application's message loop is idleâ€”provide a mechanism for handling low-priority tasks in a single-user environment. In a Remote Desktop Services environment, however, one user's background task competes for CPU cycles with another user's foreground tasks. When multiple users are running both foreground and background tasks, the CPU demands are much higher than when all users are running only foreground tasks. To maximize CPU availability for all users, either disable background tasks when running in a Remote Desktop Services environment or create efficient background tasks that are not resource-intensive.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="detecting-the-terminal-services-environment.html">Detecting the Remote Desktop Services environment</a>. After you detect the Remote Desktop Services environment, you can disable or reconfigure background tasks for the application using the same set of APIs that you used to manage the tasks.</p>

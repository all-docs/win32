<h1>Remote Desktop Services API</h1>
<p>Most applications run without modification in a Remote Desktop Services (formerly known as Terminal Services) environment and do not need to use the Remote Desktop Services API. The Remote Desktop Services API is primarily useful to client/server applications and applications for Remote Desktop Services administration.</p>
<p>The Remote Desktop Services API is a set of function calls into Wtsapi32.dll. To design your application to run in both Remote Desktop Services and non-Remote Desktop Services environments, use run-time dynamic linking to check for the presence of Wtsapi32.dll. For more information, see <a href="run-time-linking-to-wtsapi32-dll.html">Run-Time Linking to Wtsapi32.dll</a>.</p>
<p>The Remote Desktop Services API enables applications to perform the following tasks in a Remote Desktop Services environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="terminal-services-administration.html">Remote Desktop Services Administration</a>, such as enumerating and managing Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) servers (formerly known as terminal servers) in a domain or enumerating and managing sessions and processes on an RDÂ Session Host server.</li>
<li>Enhancing client/server applications in a Remote Desktop Services environment.</li>
<li>Using <a href="terminal-services-virtual-channels.html">Remote Desktop Services Virtual Channels</a> to communicate between client and server modules of an application.</li>
<li><a href="terminal-services-user-configuration.html">Setting and retrieving Remote Desktop Services specific user configuration information</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Remote Desktop Services (Remote Desktop Services)</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Windows ServerÂ 2012Â R2, Windows ServerÂ 2012, Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2, or Windows ServerÂ 2008 with Remote Desktop Services (formerly known as Terminal Services) allow a server to host multiple, simultaneous client sessions. Remote Desktop uses Remote Desktop Services technology to allow a single session to run remotely. A user can connect to a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) server (formerly known as a terminal server) by using Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client software. The Remote Desktop Web Connection extends Remote Desktop Services technology to the web.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!Note]<br />
This topic is for software developers. If you are looking for user information for Remote Desktop connections, See <a href="https://windows.microsoft.com/windows/remote-desktop-connection-faq#1TC=windows-8">Remote Desktop Connection: frequently asked questions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<h2>Where applicable</h2>
<p>A Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client can exist in a variety of forms. Thin-client hardware devices that run an embedded Windows-based operating system can run the RDC client software to connect to an RDÂ Session Host server. Windows-, Macintosh-, or UNIX-based computers can run RDC client software to connect to an RDÂ Session Host server to display Windows-based applications. This combination of RDC clients provides access to Windows-based applications from virtually any operating system.</p>
<h2>Developer audience</h2>
<p>Developers who use Remote Desktop Services should be familiar with the C and C++ programming languages and the Windows-based programming environment. Familiarity with client/server architecture is required. The Remote Desktop Web Connection includes scriptable interfaces to create and deploy scriptable virtual channels within Remote Desktop Services web applications.</p>
<h2>Run-time requirements</h2>
<p>Applications that use Remote Desktop Services require Windows ServerÂ 2012Â R2, WindowsÂ 8.1, Windows ServerÂ 2012, WindowsÂ 8, Windows ServerÂ 2008Â R2, WindowsÂ 7, Windows ServerÂ 2008, or WindowsÂ Vista. To use Remote Desktop Web Connection functionality, the Remote Desktop Services client application requires Internet Explorer and a connection to the World Wide Web. For information about run-time requirements for a particular programming element, see the Requirements section of the reference page for that element.</p>

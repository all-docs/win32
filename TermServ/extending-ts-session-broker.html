<h1>Extending Terminal Services Session Broker</h1>
<p>Terminal Services Session Broker (TSÂ Session Broker) determines whether a user who initiates a connection has a session open already. If so, TSÂ Session Broker routes the incoming connection to the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) server with the existing session. If not, TSÂ Session Broker routes the incoming connection to the RDÂ Session Host server with the fewest sessions.</p>
<p>You can extend TSÂ Session Broker by using the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tssbx/nn-tssbx-iwtssbplugin"><strong>IWTSSBPlugin</strong></a> COM interface. You can use this interface to manage connections to RDÂ Session Host servers as well as any kind of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection, for example, connections to guest virtual machines that are running WindowsÂ Vista Enterprise Centralized Desktop (VECD) on a Windows ServerÂ 2008 Hyper-V virtual machine host.</p>
<p>The <a href="/windows/desktop/api/Tssbx/nn-tssbx-iwtssbplugin"><strong>IWTSSBPlugin</strong></a> interface offers several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not necessary to install an agent on the client or the RDÂ Session Host server.</li>
<li>The plug-in can interact seamlessly with other Remote Desktop Services role services, such as Remote Desktop Gateway (RDÂ Gateway), and rely on information from TSÂ Session Broker about session and computer states.</li>
<li>You can use the plug-in to manage connections with client or server devices that support RDP 5.2 or later.</li>
<li>You can use the plug-in to enable WindowsÂ Vista Enterprise Centralized Desktop solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you implement the methods of this interface, keep the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TSÂ Session Broker might call the methods of this COM object from multiple threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of the called methods do not return immediately and successfully, TSÂ Session Broker makes no more calls to the plug-in and reverts to its native load-balancing logic. To resume calls to the plug-in, you must restart the Terminal Services Session Broker service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must register the plug-in as a system-wide COM object by using Regsvr32.exe. Because the Terminal Services Session Broker service runs under the &quot;NetworkService&quot; account, you must give the &quot;NetworkService&quot; account the required launch, activation, and access permissions by using Dcomcnfg.exe. The Terminal Services Session Broker service looks for the CLSID of the COM object that represents the plug-in in the following registry subkey:</p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</strong>\<strong>SYSTEM</strong>\<strong>CurrentControlSet</strong>\<strong>Services</strong>\<strong>Tssdis</strong>\<strong>Parameters</strong>\<strong>ExtensibilityPluginCLSID</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

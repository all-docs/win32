<h1>Using the Remote Desktop Services API</h1>
<p>This section describes how you can use the Remote Desktop Services API to enable applications to perform the following tasks in a Remote Desktop Services environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing <a href="terminal-services-administration.html">Remote Desktop Services Administration</a> tasks, such as enumerating and managing Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) servers in a domain or enumerating and managing sessions and processes on an RDÂ Session Host server.</li>
<li>Enhancing client/server applications in a Remote Desktop Services environment.</li>
<li><a href="using-terminal-services-virtual-channels.html">Using Remote Desktop Services Virtual Channels</a> to communicate between client and server modules of an application.</li>
<li>Setting and retrieving <a href="terminal-services-user-configuration.html">Remote Desktop Services User Configuration</a> information.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your application runs in an environment that is not a Remote Desktop Services environment, but you want to use the Remote Desktop Services API to provide additional functionality in a Remote Desktop Services environment, see <a href="run-time-linking-to-wtsapi32-dll.html">Run-Time Linking to Wtsapi32.dll</a>.</p>

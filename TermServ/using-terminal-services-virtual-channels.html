<h1>Using Remote Desktop Services virtual channels</h1>
<p>To implement a virtual channel, you provide the server and client modules of a virtual channel's application. The server module can be a user-mode application or a kernel-mode driver. The client module must be a DLL.</p>
<p>For descriptions of these modules, see the following topics.</p>
<h2>In this section</h2>

<p><a href="virtual-channel-server-application.html">Virtual Channel Server Application</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The server module of an application that uses virtual channels must be a user-mode application running in a client session on the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) server. Note that you must provide a method to start the server application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="virtual-channel-client-dll.html">Virtual Channel Client DLL</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The client of a virtual channels application is a DLL that is loaded during the Remote Desktop Services initialization on the client computer. The DLL must be registered on the client computer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="virtual-channel-client-registration.html">Virtual Channel Client Registration</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You must store the name of the client DLL in the registry.</p>

<p><a href="remote-control-persistent-virtual-channels.html">Remote Control Persistent Virtual Channels</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A remote control persistent virtual channel is not closed when a remote control connects or disconnects for the session connected to the client. Data will continue to be transmitted and received through this channel.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="dynamic-virtual-channels.html">Dynamic Virtual Channels</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dynamic virtual channel (DVC) APIs extend the existing virtual channel APIs for Remote Desktop Services, known as static virtual channel (SVC) APIs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you have enabled a virtual channel's application in your Remote Desktop Services deployment, you can also make the application available to client computers that access the RDÂ Session Host server by means of the Remote Desktop ActiveX control. For more information, see <a href="using-the-remote-desktop-activex-control-with-virtual-channels.html">Using the Remote Desktop ActiveX Control with Virtual Channels</a>.</p>

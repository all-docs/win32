<h1>Writing Data by Using a DVC Channel</h1>
<p>Writing channel data by using a dynamic virtual channel (DVC) is symmetric for both the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDÂ Session Host) server and the client. The writing of channel data is implemented by the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/TsVirtualChannels/nf-tsvirtualchannels-iwtsvirtualchannel-write"><strong>Write</strong></a> method of the <a href="/windows/desktop/api/TsVirtualChannels/nn-tsvirtualchannels-iwtsvirtualchannel"><strong>IWTSVirtualChannel</strong></a> interface.</p>
<p>The following illustration shows the sending and receiving of the data packet between the DVC client and server (DVC plug-in).</p>

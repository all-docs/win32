<h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
<p>There is an &quot;echo&quot; listener that is implemented by the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client, which is always present and listening for incoming connections. When you are writing the server side of a dynamic virtual channel (DVC) module, as a quick test you can open an endpoint named &quot;ECHO&quot;. Any write to a channel that is instantiated from this endpoint will result in the receipt of the same data.</p>
<p>You can use this technique to test an input/output (I/O) implementation of the server-side module, to measure the response time for a Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client plug-in, or to measure the network delay for the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) client. There is no limitation on the amount of data that can be sent over this channel.</p>

<h1>Remote Desktop Services WMI provider</h1>
<p>The Remote Desktop Services WMI provider provides programmatic access to the information and settings that are exposed by the Remote Desktop Services Configuration/Connections Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in.</p>
<p>The provider DLL is loaded by the Windows Management process (Winmgmt.exe) when a client makes a request to the server. Administration is possible by using the provider methods. The provider is registered as both an instance and a method provider.</p>
<p>The Remote Desktop Services WMI provider has been implemented as a dynamic provider derived from the <a href="/windows/desktop/CIMWin32Prov/win32-service"><strong>Win32_Service</strong></a> base class, inheriting all of its properties and methods, and an in-process dynamic link library.</p>
